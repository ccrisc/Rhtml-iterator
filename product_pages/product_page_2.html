This one almost seems like a different product! the battery fits into the phone more snuggly and the cover looks and feels different, fiting the phone much better than the first purchase or its replacement (see original review below). Also of interest, the antenna is now white instead of black, as for the functionality of the antenna I cannot comment at this time as I haven't attempted any purchases with this new cover in place.All in all this purchase has been an improvement over my initial purchase from Crazy Cart.Original review:When I recieved the first battery from Crazy Cart I had my suspicions, the label was faded and there was a slight smudged spot as if the ink on the lettering had been rubbed off. I suspected a previously used product. My suspicions only grew greater when, after the six recommended charge/discharge cycles, the battery gave me no more discharge time than the OEM battery that came with my phone.I contacted Crazy Cart and after some emailing back and forth they finally sent me a replacement. Right out of the package I could see a difference, the label on the new battery was brightly colored and all lettering was bold and distinct. The battery delivered a full ten hours of discharge time with regular use after the first twelve hour charge/discharge cycle and after the recommended six cycles the battery is giving me anywhere from fourteen to twentyfour hours depending on  my usage, and will actually trickle up during standby mode.The  one weakness that this product has, and I found this to be true with both the first and second shipments, is the battery cover. It doesn't seat properly at the corner where the SPen sets and there is a tiny gap along the top edge that collects debri.I do like the rubbery feel of the cover, it is much easier to grip than the slicker OEM battery cover. I do wish the cover was more streamlined like those made for the international version of the Galaxy Note, the gel cover I bought to use with the extended battery would have no open gap where the window is cut for the camera lens and flash. It is a matter of function determining shape however and in this case the manufacturer had to accomodate the antenna that is part of the ATT version of the Note.in conclusion I take off one star for the failing of the first battery shipped to me and a second star for the poor fit of the battery cover, the replacement battery itself works as described. I may end up buying a second one as I travel occassionally and planes have no accomodations for charging a cell phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008MRGBZG" id="B008MRGBZG-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-10:</strong> It seems to last as long as the other batteries without the weight.

In fact, it seems to drain significantly faster than the factory battery. I've used this with a smattering of custom ROMs and firmware versions, none of which seemed to provide the mythical all day battery life which is described by other reviewers. If anyone has any sort of voodoo charging methods to alleviate this problem it'd be much appreciated. It seems as though I may have received something of a dud after reading the other reviews but I just wanted to put the review out there so that folks know that your mileage may vary with this product.The plastic back for the battery fit well and felt secure. I find that the little ridge is very convenient when typing in portrait and unobtrusive when in landscape.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008MRGBZG" id="B008MRGBZG-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-23:</strong> The battery drained twice as fast as the 2 year old stock battery.

That is frustrating and those experiences made me not like the galaxy note.This 5200 mah battery seems to charge fast and lasts about twice as long as the original battery. The cover fits fine and as many have mentioned, it is more comfortable to hold while using it.with recent upgrade to jelly bean (I like the google now a lot) , and no worries of the phone dying while using the GPS, now i like this phone more than ever. I feel like i just got a new phone.anybody want this for the price of postage?

The cover did not fit correctly.  Luckily, I ordered the TPU case and it holds the battery cover and battery in place but I shouldn't have to use this just to hold it in place.

The case comes in 3 parts. An inside plastic shell which snaps together PERFECTLY unlike the Defender case that squeaks whenever you press a button.  The second set of protection is the silicone cover. The third is another hard plastic partial cover which provides extra protection to the impact zones of the phone.  This piece is very important. My Otterbox's inside case chipped at the top left corner from a fall...with the Seido Case this would not happen because it has the extra protection at the corners. The seido case also leaves no openings except for the speaker and mic holes.  Seido leaves the option to use your own screen protector.  The Otterbox forces you to use its built in screen protector.  The biggest plus of the Seido case is the holster.  The case fits my wide police duty belt perfectly, something the Otterbox could not do.  Great case, just upset that i spent money on the Otterbox first.UPDATE: After a month, the holster release latch broke off while i was taking the phone from the holster....not so durable for a "RUGGED" case/holster.  Sigh...took one star off.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003ZZXLHQ" id="B003ZZXLHQ-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-11-13:</strong> I ordered the Rugged because I work construction and my phones take a beating. But I really only need two things, some sort of protection if/when I drop it and a holster that is easy to get my phone in and out of with some sort of positive feedback that it's locked in place.  I picked the Rugged because, well it was rugged, had a camera cover and the holster looked like it would secure the phone but be easy to insert/release the phone.It is definitely rugged, the case itself is made up of a sandwich of a hard plastic interior case (the Innocase Surface), silicon middle case and then a spider like exterior cover that mostly protects the back and corners.  This sandwich like design seems like a reasonable method of dissipating the energy from a fall.  I happen to like the bulk created by the case, it makes it easier to hold for me, but be warned that the combined bezel created by the layers is really thick, and I am unable to get to the edges of the screen (I am completely unable to move icons between screens with this cover on).  What's really mind boggling is that given the additional bulk from this case, it's not designed to work with the extended battery.  (I think the mixed reports of it actually working has to do with the fact that there are two different versions of the Verizon extended battery ~1800mah and ~1930mah but I honestly don't know)The camera cover is just a flap of the silicon portion of the middle case, it's not a sliding plastic door like I thought the picture shows.  This is a big problem in my opinion and one of the reasons that this case will have to be returned.  The silicon flap when closed rests against the camera lens window itself.  This means that any dirt or abrasive material that gets in there will scratch the camera window, the exact thing I'm trying to avoid.The holster itself is sturdy, has a ratchet style turning belt clip and definitely holds the entire assembled case firmly.  The only problem is that the design of the spring loaded retention is shaped in a way that when putting the phone into the holster on your hip, there is a very likely chance that the clip will hit the screen first, not the bezel.  This is the deal breaker for me, I'm not going to subject the screen of the phone to repeated strikes from the case that is supposed to protect it.If you're the kind of person who is disciplined enough to place the phone in the holster perfectly every time, then this isn't a problem for you.  But to be quite honest, I smash my phone into the holster constantly all day long, making sure I have perfect technique is not my primary concern.Also worth mentioning; as someone else pointed out, the location for the directions is just bizarre.  The directions are split into two papers, one sits inside the case where the phone itself goes, if you're careful you can remove it without completely tearing it, then the second piece of paper is actually sandwiched between the inner case and the silicon case (IIRC).  Very odd choice of packing directions considering the large blister pack the whole thing comes in.Normally my reviews are not this negative, I guess I'm frustrated.  All I really need is a holster that's as simple as the one for my blackberry.  In all it's not a bad case, but it's not the case for me, I'm going to have to keep looking.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003ZZXLHQ" id="B003ZZXLHQ-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-03-09:</strong> This has to be the best case for your Droid X if you need rugged protection.  I use the holster and carry on my belt so the face in protection is a must and I love the flaps that cover and protect all the ports and camera.  I have never dropped my phone but I am certain that this case would protect it to the fullest if I ever did!  The only complaint I can even think of would be that the holster belt clip isn't adjustable...meaning it fits up to a 2" "duty" belt so on my regular 1.5" belt it has room to move up and down; but it really isn't a big deal at all.You will absolutely not go wrong with this case if ultimate protection is what you need!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003ZZXLHQ" id="B003ZZXLHQ-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-08-14:</strong> The Item was more than I expected.  It appears to be very durable.  I believe the case is of a very good design.It has two cases. You first install an outer shell which works good on its own.  Then there is a silicone glove that goes over the shell providing a very durable cover.  In addition there is a outer plastic corner protector that helps protect the covers and keeps the silicone glove secure.  The sylone protect the buttons and camera lens.Very nice concept.The reason for the three stars is the belt clip.  I cary a book bag.  The second week of usage I had an incomming call, I removed my phone to anwer the call when I arrived to the car an remove my book bad the bag caught on the belt clip and broke it.  I do not know the answer but I would suggest protecting the belt clip when the phone is not in its holder.  I also noticed this clip tends to get caught on my seat belt.I believe the case will do an excellent job protecting the phone just be careful with the belt clip, especially if the phone is not in it.I have an old Motorola belt clip that works with the hard plasic inner shell of this case.  I plan to see if the belt clip can be purchased seperately.  I work in a steel mill and the environment is very harsh.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003ZZXLHQ" id="B003ZZXLHQ-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-11-05:</strong> I originally purchased the Otterbox Defender and was happy with it for awhile. (2 mos.) The outer silicone casing streched out on me leaving it sloppy where it covers the buttons on the bottom. I wasn't too fond of the buttons being covered in the first place. Ok, that I dealt with. Next the built in screen protector on the Otterbox seperated from the top inner snap-on cover. Ok, enough is enough! I ordered the Seidio Convert and couldn't be happier. The outer silicone case cover is held on by a plastic/nylon? exo-skeleton shell which holds the silicone in place perfectly and I'm happy that my four bottom buttons aren't covered. Problem solved. I do give credit to Otterbox because when I called their warranty number, they are sending out a brand new whole case assembly priority shipping as soon as they get more in stock. In conclusion I would have to say it's a user's preference as to which style and the Otterbox is less expensive.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003ZZXLHQ" id="B003ZZXLHQ-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-12-31:</strong> I've been using this case and holster for about a month and I'm very pleased with it.Yes, it definitely makes the phone look very large, but I kinda like that and it's a big phone to begin with.I always use it with the rugged skin and holster so can't comment on the innocase but I did have to pull the battery on it a few days ago and it was a pain in the butt to undress all the layers from it.I don't think it's realistic to think it will protect the phone from shocks of being dropped, nor will any case for that matter, but I'm confident it will keep the phone from getting scratched and I dropped it in mushy snow last week and having the multiple layers protected the phone from moisture intrusion.Here's what I don't like...The camera lens cover is definitely a must have, but this little flap is difficult to open and it doesn't want to stay plugged in to the little slot, resulting in the rubber flap photobombing its fair share of pictures.The port and jack flaps are a must have too but I can see all rubber flaps breaking off after some time but especially the camera lens flap.They can improve the belt clip by simply terminating it at 270 degrees. This one gets stuck on your underwear  or pans or belt when you try to pull it off. By looping it around like two way radio belt clips, this would not be a problem.I do find that dirt, lint and pet hair sticks to the rubber and felt. But better that than get inside the phone.One of the reviewers complained that you have to carefully put it back in the case so as not to smash the display. I was concerned about this but I haven't found that to be a problem because if you miss, the holser touches the speaker area. In my view, you'd have to be really careless or uncoordinated to accidently smash the top of the holser into the display.I would definitely recommend this and buy another. This is the best rugged case and holster I have seen.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003ZZXLHQ" id="B003ZZXLHQ-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-28:</strong> Good and small but just feels cheap.

The material isn't enough to protect your phone if you drop it, given the material it's made of. But depending on how you accidentally drop it, with less force, the case will sustain your phone. Also, it's pretty light, so it's not tiring to hold or carry your phone. I also liked that it's easy to put together. It's not like other phone cases where it's kinda difficult to snap the pieces together.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003VMF77K" id="B003VMF77K-review49" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-28:</strong> This case is not worth it.

I just sold it on another site in Like New Condition.For a buck and a half a pop, you can actually buy enough of them to last you a life time, and I mean until you retire and become an old guy whom nobody would want to take the same elevator with, and all that for the price of only one copy at your local mall.This is highly recommended for those who care for their cell phones enough to keep them from getting bumped around, scratched and dented or cracked.

Horrible.When removing the tray, the SIM card immediately falls on the floor.  The microSD card does not even sit in the tray, so you have to remember that it's supposed to be placed by hand into the slot of the phone, with the tray and SIM card carefully balanced to be pushed back into the side of the phone for the retaining catch to hold this all in place. Did I say horrible?When connected through the USB cable to a computer, the new operating system no longer lets a user "see" the cell phone's internal memory and microSD card as separate drives.  They want you to download, install, and use a Google software management application.Previously, when connecting the USB cable, you got three popups on your computer monitor: an earlier software management application (that you didn't have to use), a "windows" type file folder query for the internal phone folders, and another "windows" type file folder query for quick access to the folders on the microSD card.SO, the quick way to now get to your photos and videos moved over to your home computer is to remove the microSD card and use a card reader.  Oh, wait, what if I forgot or lost the dang key? (see aforementioned)Minor additional problems they have created include moving some of the function icons around on the touch screen. Takes some getting used to, that's all, but there is no clear advantage to their having done so, hence, it's judged "negative."Another problem is that they have moved the camera lens to the upper center of the backside of the phone, right where your hand typically touches.  Smeared lens and blurry photos follow.  When the lens was in the corner, they picked a spot that ordinarily is in the clear. So this was change for the negative.The USB and HDMI jacks are exposed, no protective cover to keep dust out.  They've also relocated these jacks to the lower left corner as you look at the operating screen, so you may need to re-route your charging cable. In that location, both jacks are more likely to pick up dirt.  I'll probably put a piece of electrical tape over the holes because as soon as dust gets near there, the cable pushed in pushes in the dirt too.Nice screen, nice battery.  My selected APPs work well, and I've given up complaining about all the bloatware included with the phone. Just like the earlier Razr MAXX.  The "HD" is more marketing than substance.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009P5XSAU" id="B009P5XSAU-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-15:</strong> This is a great phone.  I've had it a couple months now.  Good reception, very long battery life, even though it's not the Maxx model, and never drops Bluetooth connectivity.  I had the predecessor to this, the Droid X, for a couple years, and was very satisfied with it, but moved up to the Razr because it's 4G and a better screen.  It's also faster, of course.  It has a solid, sturdy feel to it, which i like.  I had considered the S3 but was put off with it by some reports of overheating (!) and screen fragility issues.  The Razr is not fragile, as I can attest to.My only complaint is that it's every hard to see the screen outdoors. If you use yours outdoor a lot, try it in a store and walk outside to see how it looks before purchasing.  I'm going to change screen protectors to see if that helps. I'm using using Fosmon brand on it, so I doubt that's the problem.  I don't take many pics with it, but the ones I've taken are good quality, which is fine.  Primarily I use it for business, where I log about 2,000 minutes a month with a Bluetooth headset.  That requires only an every-other day charge, and even then it's only down to about 30% the end of the second day. I haven't had any issues with lockups or related problems. I've also used it as a mobile hotspot for my laptop and it had good throughput for that.For every day heavy usage and good reception, I recommend this phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009P5XSAU" id="B009P5XSAU-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-04:</strong> This phone has to be one of the top 5 Android phones available right now.  One thing that made this phone stand out from the competition is the build quality.  It feels rock solid with its KEVLAR backing, Gorilla Glass, and a water-repellent nanocoating for added assurance.I've owned this phone for about 6 weeks now and the performance is 2nd to none.  Call quality is great even on the speaker phone; and the battery life is above average for a smartphone with this size of display and performance specs.  Motorola has done a very good job of minimizing their presence within the Android OS, while still providing some very useful custom apps, such as SMARTACTIONS, Circles and the Quick Settings menu.  SMARTACTIONS allows you to automate tasks based on conditions; for example if your battery power drops below 25%, it will automatically adjust the display brightness, and turn off the WiFi or any other feature you elect to change.  The conditions are not limited to battery power; it can be based on your GPS location, like silencing your ringer while at work, or based on time of day, etc...  "Circles" is a nice widget that displays information of your choosing such as time, weather, battery level etc...  With "Quick Settings" you simply swipe to the left from the home screen to access frequently used settings.As many other reviewers have stated, the one area this phone falls short is the camera.  Despite its 8.0MP rating, it does not perform very well in most environments.  My experience has been that pictures are grainy and colors are not true.  I was aware of the poor camera reviews before I purchased the phone, so I had an idea of what I was getting.  Although a better camera would be really nice; I have a DSLR that I use at events where I desire high quality photos so it wasn't a deal breaker for me, but for others it might be; especially because some of the competitors have really outstanding cameras.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B009P5XSAU', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B009P5XSAU', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00A3NHCCI</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00A3NHCCI</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

They kept getting bigger, and more numerous, so I took it to an Apple store to see what could be done. The guy told me the scratches were probably on the screen itself, since iPhone glass doesn't scratch. Obviously I didn't believe him (even when he tried to scratch his iPad with a key to demonstrate it wouldn't happen), but I had 2 more protectors at home and I had a bit of hope.

Don't waste your money.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GJFZSJS" id="B00GJFZSJS-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-21:</strong> Sounds good, but I don't like the way it fits on me.

Why? Well - If in between a game break I wanted to walk away for a second - all I needed to do was put down the controller and go do. But like the reviews - This is a bad idea. The ear-loop is also terrible. Constantly falling out and off the ear! Some of the veterans laughed when I told them the type of headset I had. They quickly said sell it and get a nice Turtle Beach headset. If you'e going to game, 1 ear isn't enough - you need surround sound and good headset to deliver. The other thing is I have to talk very loudly to be heard. I can hear very well though :)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FMLXW2" id="B005FMLXW2-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-16:</strong> It will pick up everything except voice.  then sometimes it will pick me up talking to friends other times it will not at all.

The earpiece doesn't fit inside your ear. It just kinda sits outside your ear canal and rests on that piece of your ear. I got used to this quickly and its very comfortable.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005FMLXW2" id="B005FMLXW2-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-15:</strong> In light of the absolute idiocy of so many people that traffic this site, I'll rewrite this review to clarify what I was saying before.I wanted this earpiece to be great, I got it with the intention of loving it, the only thing I don't like about the old school earpiece is that it's uncomfortable after a while. So I had no reason to prime myself with negative thinking towards this device. However, when it got here, it didn't waste any time making me a very unhappy customer. I have a lot, and I mean a LOT of bluetooth devices, everything from speakers, to conference speakers, to hands free speaker kits for the truck, headphones, ipods, all my computers, you name it, I've likely got it, I even have an older mp3 player watch around here somewhere with bluetooth... Anyways, the point is, I'm familiar with the system empirically and educationally, and my HTC HD7 had a hell of a time with this peripheral. My plantronics 925 pairs up to it in less than a minute once you have it in pairing mode, this piece took me a good 45 minutes, not because I didn't know what I was doing, but because there was something going on with the bluetooth mechanism in the earpiece.Something that seems to have pissed off so many previous readers is that I said "I hate windows phones", and I do, the operating system sucks and the UI is outright retarded. Splitting hairs with me over whether or not the HD7 is a "windows/microsoft product" or not is completely pointless, as the point is, it is a "windows phone", and it didn't work well with the "xbox earpiece". Do I have to be a comedian and say it in a funny voice for the levity of that to not fly right over your heads?Anyways, once paired, the piece performed horridly, I couldn't walk more than 3 feet from the phone, and I had to keep the side of my head upon which the piece was mounted facing the phone at all times, as apparently my thick skull was enough to interrupt the connection. However, it was still comfortable, and has a great battery life, so I figured if "hell, if it works well on the xbox I'll still keep it". But it didn't. My gen1 wireless piece sounded better, and operated at a functional capacity to a greater distance than this one. So I sent it back.In all fairness, should I have gotten an exchange in case something was wrong with the piece I got? Maybe. But I didn't, I sent it back and said "f it", because this one was so bad I didn't really care to make another go at it. If they release another, improved one, I'll give it another shot, as the idea was great. But this piece deserves one star based on my experience with it, and that's what I gave it, I cannot with a good conscience suggest it to anyone.If you don't like this review because you somehow think my experience isn't to be trusted, keep it to yourself. I don't write these reviews to pander to an audience of idiot consumers that reinforce bad behavior and shoddy manufacturing from corporations, I write them for critically minded consumers who expect a full and functional experience out of what they buy.

You can use it on your Xbox, then switch it over to Bluetooth mode and take it with you for use with your phone (or any other Bluetooth device).However, after wearing it for a couple of minutes, I did not like the feel of it on my ear. I tried all the included hooks and earbuds, but it always felt like the headset was going to fall off my ear. It never actually did, but it felt like it. Perhaps all headsets like this feel that way, but regardless this is just not for me.I do encourage you to give this a try, especially if you are comfortable with other Bluetooth headsets like this.

The slot on the back is the star of this case, for anyone who doesn't want to carry their purse or wallet when they go out.  It holds one card securely or two cards very tightly.  I was not at all concerned about losing my cards.  The cards can be slid in and out easily, but will not come out on their own.  This would be a great way to carry a hotel room cardkey while on vacation.  The hard shell case matches the phone well and fits snugly.  It provides just enough texture to make the phone easy to hold, but adds almost no bulk.  Because it's a hard plastic there won't be any stretch over time taking cards out and putting them back.  It provides protection on the top, bottom and corners from scratches and short drops.  All the buttons are left open for easy access, and it is easy to plug in headphones or a charger.  There is no stand, as indicated in the description.I gave this case five stars, even though it doesn't have a stand as the description says.  I got it for the card slot feature and it performed beyond expectation.  I will recommend this to friends.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00ALRUC28" id="B00ALRUC28-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-10:</strong> This case provides great convenience while keeping your S3 protected.  The case itself wraps around all the sides of the phone, including the top and bottom, leaving no corners or edges unprotected.  It's raised up just a hair above the screen, so I don't know how well it will protect that.  It's a fairly hard plastic, so it doesn't always come on and off the easiest, though it certainly doesn't feel like it will break when doing so, or crack from a drop.  Overall, I feel comfortable keeping my phone  in this case.The key feature of this case, however, is the card holder on the back.  While it may make the phone slighly thicker overall, the convenience can't be denied for certain situations.  Whether I'm going walking, hiking, running, playing sports, or going to the gym, its great to not have to bring my wallet.  I simply tuck my license, a credit card, and either my student ID or a few folded bills in the back pocket of the case and I'm good to go!  Makes it much easier when I can fit my phone in one pocket and my keys in my other and be set, considering gym shorts don't have back pockets.  Plus, if your wallet is a little thick, it gives you the ability to leave it home even when wearing normal pants.Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone with a fairly active lifestyle.  While it may not offer the most solid protection, its certainly enough for me, and its convenience can't be denied!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00ALRUC28" id="B00ALRUC28-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-29:</strong> Very nice quality product.  I got it for my wife so she could put her ID in the slot and not need to carry a purse.  She loves it although I think it feels weird while holding the phone to talk on it.

The case slot in the back easily holds a few credit cards and a drivers license.  The  case is rugged and durable.

Another thing I thought was a nice feature was the snap on part that goes around to the front of the phone adds just a very little lip so if you have this case on your phone and set it on your desk face down, it doesn't let the screen touch the desk. I was not willing to test the impact ability of this case but it isn't too rigid that your phone would take all the shock through the case and it's not too soft to do nothing for protection.Added Convince -The two slots on the side of the case that you can see in the pictures are not just there for aesthetics, that is a slot that's built in the phone so you can add a credit card or a identification card behind your phone. This has a cool side for the people that just want to carry only their phone around, however you can pretty much tell what card it is behind the case, and with the s3 being a hot phone, if someone were to steal it, they would then also have your card of choice with it. And I say card of choice due to the fact that you can pretty much only fit one card behind the phone without wedging them in, tried a debit card and my drivers licence and it was too tight.The case is pretty light, pretty thin, provides decent protection for the back of the phone, and if you want to carry ONE card with you under the case there's that option as well, all in all, nice product. (3 stars due to only fitting 1 card in the slot and too easy for people to tell that you're carrying a card with your phone.)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00ALRUC28" id="B00ALRUC28-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-04:</strong> I am evaluating this product as a project.  I like the feel of this product, the polycarbonate is malleable to be able to hold in your hand, yet not so rigid to be uncomfortable to use.  I especially like the slot in the back of the case to allow the user to use it to store identification or credit cards.  The weight is light and eliminates in cumbersome feeling when the case is attached to the phone.  I did not see how the case can be used as a stand unless you push the phone part way out of the case to cause a tripod effect.  The example here on the web site does not show how that is being used.  I don't really think you can use this as a stand. I would have given the case a 5 star, except that the description of the stand did not seem logical.  I like the color, the feel, the way it grabs the phone, should protect the front from scratches since it curves around the top and bottom of the phone.  The case also is designed to easily and freely allow you to use a charger cable and a headset, without having to remove the phone from the case.  I suggest it to be a good buy, but the stand needs to be clarified and an example put on the descriptive page to show how that works.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00ALRUC28" id="B00ALRUC28-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-25:</strong> I bought this case to place a proxy key card in for my work so I didn't have to wear the card around my neck. The key card was a little thicker than a normal credit card but it fit just fine. This case can also hold one to two normal cards total. However, with the key card in not much else fits. My only negative point would be that the sides are not well protected. There is the possibility for scratches on the edges by the power and volume buttons. But other than that seems like a great case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00ALRUC28', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00ALRUC28', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00HFEJNNO</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00HFEJNNO</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

Why?  I walk to work most days, and when I do go somewhere it's usually within an hour's drive.  However, we recently took a long weekend trip and needed to recharge phones en route.This phone charger performed like a champ.  It fits snugly into the power socket in the car and charged our phones as quickly as they charge when we plug them into wall outlets at home.There are two improvements I would suggest, though these are not fatal flaws:1) How about an indicator light to let you know that the unit is seated completely in the power outlet?2) It would  be really nice if the coiled cord was a bit longer.  OK, a little more about this one...When I was riding along and trying to use my phone while it was plugged in the cord length was not quite long enough to reach from the power outlet, which is actually in a console between the front seats and my ear while seated up front.  I gave it some healthy tugs and stretches, but it was still a little short but not too bad after that.  It will take some more limbering up and additional stretching and then it may reach all the way with no problem.All in all a solid charger that does what it's designed to do, but with only minor issues.I give this unit a strong 4-stars</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HFEJNNO" id="B00HFEJNNO-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-28:</strong> The Samsung OEM wall charger that came with my Samsung Galaxy S4 has a stated output of 2.0 amps and this Amazon Basics car charger charges my Galaxy S4 as quickly as that wall charger.  This Amazon Basics car charger does get warm to the touch when charging, but all of the wall chargers I have used with my Galaxy S4 have the same problem.  I previously used an OEM Samsung car charger, theSamsung OEM Car Charger for Samsung Galaxy S4, Galaxy S3, Galaxy Note 2 and More (Bulk Packaging), which has an output of only .7 amps and takes quite a while to charge my phone.  So, this Amazon Basics car charger has now permanently replaced this Samsung car charger as my "go to" car charger.The coiled cord is stiff to operate, but it is long enough to be fully functional within the confines of my car.

It goes probably double that, but 2.5 feet has been a very comfortable length for normal use. Using my Moto-G while plugged in works fine with the coiled feature, but you really shouldn't be on your phone while your car is moving (hangs head in shame). The only major consideration in purchasing the Universal Car Charger for Android is thus the length of the cord. I love the coiled feature as I'm always having straight cords get tangled in my gear shift, brake handle, etc. and this keeps things a lot cleaner. It also sits a lot nicer in the glove box which is pretty cluttered also. When I pick up my Moto-G it easily stretches for use, then gets compact again when I reholster my phone.So, I plugged in my Moto-G and the micro USB connector slid in perfectly yet wasn't loose telling me the machined tolerances are solid. Tugging the phone to speak there was no hint that it would come out and I could hold the phone up by the cord. It also pops out with a reasonable tug. YMMV since you may have a different phone, obviously. It charged my Moto about as quickly as I would expect, though I'm more likely to rely on this as on the go power and to keep my phone topped off.Amazon has these manufactured to spec in China, as with probably all of the AmazonBasics line. I have had zero problems with all of the Basics products such as USB cables, wall warts, etc. Simple product, good quality, works. That 5 out of 5 stars for me.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HFEJNNO" id="B00HFEJNNO-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-12:</strong> The car charger works great, especially for devices that require more than the typical 0.5 A limit found on typical devices.However, the cord length of 4.9 feet may be somewhat misleading.  While the coiled wire is welcome in terms of avoiding &#34;self-entanglement&#34;, I found that the &#34;recoil&#34; on the cord to make its effective length about half that amount.  When I'm trying to charge my Galaxy S3, I was fighting the recoil a bit and found the cord yanking out if I stretched it too long.To be fair, however, my phone is getting quite old (and heavily used) and I think the charging receptacle isn't what it used to be in terms of holding a cable properly.  That said, I was able to use the cord to about 1/2 its advertised length with minimal fighting.  I think that you'll find that with ANY coiled solution, but the buyer should be aware.With a 2.1 Amp output, however, I'd still recommend this.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HFEJNNO" id="B00HFEJNNO-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-19:</strong> I used this product with my Galaxy S4 and have been thrilled with it's performance.  While most car chargers don't offer the same amount of power as a wall charger, this one seems to, usually charging my phone about halfway on my 40 minute evening commute, even when using it to talk with Bluetooth on.The only problem is one of personal annoyance which may or may not apply to you.  I hate how springy the cord is, invariably I will have it snap from my hand several times before getting it in the charger.  I'm probably just more of a spaz than the average person, but this is the first charger I've ever experienced this with.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HFEJNNO" id="B00HFEJNNO-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-15:</strong> I've uses a similar (slight more advanced) car charger for mini-usb, so I gave this one to my daughter.

Very disappointed. I had but ONE DAY remaining to be able to return for a replacement, and see that it is "out of stock" and not available for delivery until September?!?!?The LED went out, that normally indicates you are connected to a DC outlet in your car. Two other chargers work fine in that same outlet, and this unit does not work in any outlets in the vehicle (three were tried).The internal fuse of the unit is intact, has not blown, and there was no abnormal indication or use of the smartphone. I noticed that the charging unit had failed when the phone's icon for battery life remaining was far lower than normal.I limped along with the factory charging cord, which cannot keep up with both the phone in-use and charging the phone's battery.Although I'm glad Amazon's policy will cover a return and replacement, I hope the failure of this unit is not part of the China Syndrome of cheap products and poor quality control.Will update this review in a couple of months....-------(Original review follows. I had rated this device at four stars.)The higher power of this car charger allows me to get ahead of how much current the phone draws when I'm using it for navigation at full screen brilliance.The phone, a Motorola Razr Maxx, already has a beefy battery, but its extra capacity requires increased charging ability to bring it up to full.This device does that well.Car chargers with less power spend most of their time struggling to keep up with power demands of a smartphone that's being used.  As a result, there's very little capacity left to actually charge the phone's battery, so it will take far longer than if you turn off the phone, or when using the somewhat stronger home charger.It's important to note that this charger shows no sign of overpowering the phone, which would present a risk of cooking the battery or burning up the phone's voltage regulator circuitry that governs the charging rate.  Instead, because the phone operates normally, I conclude that this unit has the ability to supplement the power demanded by the phone, along with being able to recharge the battery.Recommended.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HFEJNNO" id="B00HFEJNNO-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-31:</strong> Car chargers at the big cell phone company stores are very expensive, so it&#8217;s good to have a basic alternative to provide a charge while on the go.The AmazonBasics Micro USB Universal Car Charger for Android has an output of 2.1 amps.

However, at best, they might be able to prevent the phone from dying while in use. Why is that? Well the Galaxy Note 3 is a larger and powerful phone, which normally uses a 2.0 amp charger. Most car chargers either can't provide this or only work at full amperage with fruit products.So enter the AmazonBasics Micro USB universal charger to save the day. For my test and typical use-case scenario, I put my phone on my dash mount, fired up some navigation software (Waze, in this instance), maxed out the screen brightness, and went for a drive. Should also note I keep all radio's on at all times, including Bluetooth for hands-free calling, Wi-Fi, 4G/LTE, and GPS, of course.After about 15-20 minutes, the battery percentage had actually increased by 5%. Success!  If this was any less than 2.0 amp, that simply wouldn't happen.Beyond that there isn't much to say. It's a basic charger design with a coiled cable that's just the right length. While it may go to over 4 ft, it was pretty stiff going past 3 ft. Although I already got that impression from the pictures Amazon posted. And for most dashes, this is more than enough. Any longer and you'll want a straight cable.Overall, I consider it highly recommended for any Android user - even though it will likely work with plenty others.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00HFEJNNO', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00HFEJNNO', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B008PNZU18</h2>    <p class="price"> $B008PNZU18</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

However, I have struggled with the style of his because it is too narrow.This is actually the perfect fit for my hand - not too thick, not too thin. The Capacitive end works well and appears to be made at least as sturdily as the others I have used and tested. Even after pressing hard on it, it did not move.When you are ready to use the pen, you remove the top and place it over the other end, protecting it while you use the pen. The colors and styling of the pen make it very professional looking. The only thing that would keep me from giving this as a gift is the fact it doesn't come in it's own case!I received a complimentary sample to test for my review and am pleased enough that I am actually carrying it and using it.

If you do not apply enough pressure, it will be unresponsive on some devices, with some devices requiring more pressure than others. While you don't have to apply a whole lot of pressure, just a light touch of the stylus may not work, so keep this in mind. Also, keeping the stylus perpendicular to the plane of the device works better in many cases (though not usually necessary). If these are issues for you, then you may not like using a stylus.Using a stylus helps keep fingerprints off your device, which is a nice benefit.My review for this executive pen stylus is as follows.I like the handiness of a single stylus and real writing pen. The real writing pen writes well (in black ink) and I'd say is more of a finer point than a medium point. The pen clip is real metal unlike others which is often chrome colored plastic.The overall quality of this executive pen is higher than most others and the heft of it gives it a nice feel.Some reviews complain of dented pens, but my pen arrived without any dents.Overall 4 stars because it's not as responsive as a real finger, but it works well enough with a moderate amount of pressure applied.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EVF3FCU" id="B00EVF3FCU-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-17:</strong> This is a very nice and well appointed stylus, but being a bit more expensive than many others I'm holding it to a little higher set of standards.First of all, this IS a very attractive pen overall, and it's got a nice feel to it. Rather than being slick and glossy, the barrel has a slight &#34;gun metal&#34; feel to it which I found very pleasant to hold in my hands and less prone to being dropped. I personally prefer a fatter barrel, but I know there are many who like a slim one, and I think this will certainly appeal not only to women, but many men as well: the slim barrel and gold trim lend more of an &#34;executive&#34; look to it...to use the pen's own descriptive term.I very much liked the rubbery capacitive tip (capacitive refers to &#34;screen&#34; technology that can detect a &#34;touch&#34; without applying pressure). I love using these tips, and I used the Sty-HD a lot on my phone screen and Kindle. I found it to be quite agreeable to use. I found no unpleasant &#34;drag time&#34; issues with the tip and thought it seemed to be very responsive. I don't foresee any problems with its strength or durability, either.I am not that impressed with its pen, however. While part of my problem is not the pen's &#34;fault,&#34; really, as I prefer a rollerball or gel tip, I took issue with the fact that the pen tip felt &#34;draggy&#34; and dryish. I don't know what kind of a refill the Sty-HD has, as the refill has no information on its exterior, but I was not that impressed with its writing ability and would be more impressed with the pen if I could slip in a more impressive writing instrument.Somewhat related to this is another problem as I see it: the stylus tip is HIDDEN when the pen is open. To me, it would make more sense if the pen were to be usable as a writing implement AND a stylus if the stylus tip was on the end of the UPPER barrel rather than the lower one. If the stylus were on the very top part of the pen case -- the part that must be taken off to get at the pen -- then the stylus would remain usable when the pen was out. I suppose some might say that this arrangement might create leakage problems for the more forgetful of us who might forget to put the cap back on when they put the pen back in their pocket, but I believe the argument for making the pen completely usable when open trumps that.So, I found the Sty-HD to be a fine stylus, but an inferior pen. If you want a stylus with a sleek look, a great feel, and nice capacitive responsiveness, and are only passably interested in a pen, then this is your stylus.NOTE: I was supplied this product free of charge with no other conditions other than my writing a fair and honest review -- which this is.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EVF3FCU" id="B00EVF3FCU-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-13:</strong> This has a nice, executive look and feel...like a nice pen.

This one, theSty-HD 17 pcs Colorful 3 Styles multipack, and theSty-HD 2 Pack of Premium Precision Micro-Knit Hybrid Fiber Tip.  Of the three, the multipack set is the most generic.  Made almost completely in plastic with some plating to look like metal, this type of stylus, perhaps the exact same stylus, can be bought from a wide selection of vendors at different prices.  In use, they work pretty ok, but not perfectly.  The glide is a little off, especially with matte screen protectors.  During testing, I noted that these tend to not work as well with Apple devices compared to Android models.  Pressing slightly harder on the Apple screens would get better functionality, but rapid movement across the screen didn't work consistently.  Overall, tolerable performance for the cheap price, hence the three stars which matches Amazon's "It's OK" meaning.  Compared to its brethren, they work as well as the Business stylus, but lack the pen.  Speaking of the Business model, though asking a premium price, its performance isn't any better than the one from the multipack as they share the same type of tip.  It looks more business like, true, but even the pen doesn't work great.  After cleaning the tip of the pen to clear off the seal to prevent ink leaking out while in shipping, I found the writing to be uneven and scratchy.  I could literally hear the ball in the tip scratching at the the paper.  To me, not worth the current price of nine bucks, and three stars for it.  That leaves this model with the hybrid fiber tip.  Of all three, these performed the best across the board.  Much better glide and screen response.  Still not perfect, as rapid movement would miss on occasion, but certainly a cut above the others.  Again, the Apple devices didn't these as much as Android devices did, and matte screen protectors deteriorated the performance slightly.  Comparing all three to the stylus that comes with my Tegra Note, the Tegra's stylus is the easy winner in all subjective and objective testing.  This is not a surprise really, as the stylus and screen of the Tegra Note were designed specifically to work together.  In the end, if you're wanting a decent stylus, hybrid tip is the one I'd suggest buying from Sty-HD.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EVF3FCU" id="B00EVF3FCU-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-13:</strong> This is a nice combination pen & stylus.

As she gave it a 3-star average rating, obviously she thought that was acceptable.  Not me!  I'll tell it like it is!  Buyer beware!Any company with severe quality control issues will never see my business.  My time is precious and my money is hard-earned.  I'm not going to pay--time-wise or money-wise--for some company's lack of concern for its customers.And, can you believe that this company sent me this stylus for free hoping I'd write a review for them, and obviously didn't even care that they were sending me a flawed product.A word about the length of this pen:  It starts out looking like a normal length &#34;executive's&#34; pen, but when the cap is removed to expose the writing point, the pen shortens to an unmanly 4 1/2&#34;.A word about the stylus end:  The rubber is thin and sometimes dimples (and stays dimpled).  Because it is such a thin rubber it doesn't have the resilience to work every time.  It gives way and you end up pushing on the flat ridge under the rubber bulb.A word about the ball point:  The point is fine.  The ball does not roll easily and therefore the roll feels scratchy rather than smooth.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EVF3FCU" id="B00EVF3FCU-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-15:</strong> I really like theBusiness Stylus Executive Pen by Sty-HDbecause it offers up two solutions in one for a business user.  First, the pen features a rubber tipped stylus for use with most touch screen devices.  Simple to use and quite responsive.  Second, you have a writing pen which comes in extremely handy if you need to take a written note or sign a document.In use on my tablet, the stylus performed pretty well.  As precise as I expected.  The writing pen performed just as well as most other pens I have on my desk.Overall, I really like this product as it lets me carry less and do more.  Two in one is a smart design feature and this stylus combo really meets my expectations.[Sample Provided For Review]</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EVF3FCU" id="B00EVF3FCU-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-06:</strong> The stylus looks nice and has worked and held up well, but I do have a small complaint/wish: I wish that I could somehow cover both ends to protect the rubber stylus tip. While it has showed no signs of wear, my pens get thrown in my backpack pocket together and often have keys or dirty/dusty things in with them. A little protection would keep me from worrying about the longevity of the rubber tip.In the end, it's just my own worrying mind and the rubber tip is holding up admirably. Personally, I don't find myself using the actual pen tip that much, but I do like the heavier feel of the overall stylus and it is nice to have the pen handy.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EVF3FCU" id="B00EVF3FCU-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-18:</strong> I received a complimentary Business Stylus Executive Pen for testing and review purposes.  I gave this to my husband, who uses a nice pen for work and also has big fingers that would benefit from a stylus for his phone and ipad.He loves the sleek style and black color of the pen, and the clip to hold it in his pocket.  He said the stylus part worked really well because the tip of it extends enough past the pen to give him a good surface.  It allows him to touch the screen of his ipad and phone better than he could with fingers alone.He reported to me that the pen was scratchy and skipped, despite scribbling on some scrap paper to make sure the ink was flowing. He's going to try to replace the ink filler with something better and see if that will work.Overall this is a very stylish, professional instrument that has potential.  The stylus part is great, but the ink that comes in the pen isn't suitable for work.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EVF3FCU" id="B00EVF3FCU-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-18:</strong> Disclaimer: I received this for free in exchange for a fair and honest review.So, I think this is a great idea, combining a stylus with an actual pen. Sadly, in practice, it failed.Why? Well, first off, the capacitive tip came off with normal use after two days. Second, the pen itself withdrew into the casing and there is no way to actually get it back out. No twisting mechanism, no springs, nada....so, if the pen breaks and the capacitive tip falls out, you are basically left with nothing, which is what I now have.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EVF3FCU" id="B00EVF3FCU-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-10:</strong> The sty-HD business style pen serves two needs: 1) as a ballpoint, of writing on paper and 2) as a stylus for use with an electronic device such as an iPad or iPhone.  It has a bit of weight to it, making it feel good in your hand while using the ballpoint pen.  On the bottom of the pen is a softish foam tip that works, although not too easily, as a stylus on a tablet or phone.My problem with this pen is that it was not packaged in a box as shown in the illustration but in a lightweight plastic bag that failed to protect it.  As a result, it was delivered with two large dents in the body of the pen.  I would feel embarrassed to use it during a business meeting because it looks damaged even though it works well enough.Two StarsNOTE: The manufacturer sent me a sample in return for a review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EVF3FCU" id="B00EVF3FCU-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-13:</strong> Someone has finally done it!

Pogo made one that was great, but it was too short and thin. Some of the others had rubber tips that would create enough friction with the screen to make it difficult to slide around. This stylus avoids all the shortcomings of the others I've tried. It's is the size of a traditional ballpoint pen, so it's very easy and comfortable to hold. The tip is made out of a soft rubber that glides smoothly over the surface of whatever device you are using.I tested this out on my Galaxy Note 2, my wife's S4 and Kindle Fire, as well as on a friend's iPhone 4, and the stylus performed perfectly on all the devices. I could care less about the ballpoint pen in the opposing end of the stylus, but it does write smoothly and the whole thing is well weighted and comfortable in my hand.I didn't pay for this product, as I received one to test out and review, but I paid $8.95 for the Pogo one I have and I like this one much better. This is definitely five stars all the way in my book. In fact, I'd give it six stars if I were allowed.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00EVF3FCU', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00EVF3FCU', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B005BHDEMS</h2>    <p class="price"> $B005BHDEMS</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

It appears to be well made and holds the EVO 3D just fine. I like the fact that it allows you to charge the phone while docked and that it automatically places the phone into Car Dock mode when docked.I did have a couple of minor issues with the dock. There is an insert that can be removed if you use a case for your phone to provide more room for the case. It works fine with rubber type cases as long as they are not too thick but the space was not quite wide enough for my hard case. I had to use a Dremmel tool to file away more space for my hard case but it works great now. Another issue is the suction cup tends to detach from the window a little too easy compared to some other devices I've used. It does work but I have had it fall several times. Also, the manual that came with it and the website shows two pivot points on this dock. The ball joint works as described but the arm is supposed to pivot as well. The manual and website show it has a cap that can be loosened to allow it to pivot and tightened to lock it into place but mine does not have this option. It is permanently locked into one position. It works fine attaching it to the window but if I wanted to use the part that attaches to the dash (permanently stocks to allow a flat attachment point), the pivot cannot be adjusted to all the suction to be used in this vertical mode. It appears the bolt and screwcap that allows this pivot to work has been replaced with a permanent bolt and cap. I was surprised the manual in the box clearly shows this can be loosened and adjusted but the part to be loosened has been replaced. If they redesigned the item they should have updated the manual that came in the box as well. You would think the website would be updated as well. I emailed support about this but never even received a response.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005BHDEMS" id="B005BHDEMS-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-10-29:</strong> Excellent car mount!  I have my HTC 3D in a TPU case and it fits inside this mount perfectly. The mount has a removable insert that when kept in place - provides perfect fit for a phone without a case.  When the insert is removed - then a phone in a thin case (like TPU or silicone, I suppose) would fit in nicely.  Not sure about bulky plastic cases though - those you will have to try on your own.  Additionally - one the camera lenses remains open, which will allow you to record video while driving.  The second lens is covered by the mount, so no 3D recording.Solid construction and adjustable for pretty much any possible angle of the windshield.

It looks great, and it actually does fully recharge my battery. The case is sturdy and is good for recharging and for protection.However, for some bizarre reason, the top piece of the case turned orange! I thought I was turning color blind, but it became as orange, as an orange. I never left it out in the sun, always took care of it, but only the top, turned orange. And also, that same orange top piece, started to have a &#34;cracked&#34; look in the coloring, exposing an ugly grey.This color flaw really bothered me, because it is an expensive product. If it was 20 bucks, it wouldn't bother me. But I bought it for 65 bucks.

They have all worked well but the upper half of the cases were pretty flimsy and would crack within a few months of purchase. The Mophie works well and has similar battery perfomance. If battery performance alone concerns you then a cheaper case may be what you want as this product is quite pricey.It shines in terms of design and attention to detail. Fit is very snug to the point where removing the phone can be a hassle, but I don't consider this a bad thing. All controls are easily accessed. I really like the small switch that controls the battery's access to the phone. Other cases use a button to allow access but it is tough to remember whether the phone is in charge mode or not. The top the case seems a bit better made and I expected it to last longer but my wife dropped the phone and the bottom of the case shattered.

And connections were quick and fast even if the headset was off and in my pocket I could flip open the boom (this is how you turn the unit on) and catch a call!The noise reduction is a step up especially the wind noise reduction feature.The ear fit made this my new favorite for all day wear.  (A sided note here. I generally use a med fitted insert on most headsets, but found I had to use the small.  My wife could not get a good fit.  So I would be concerned for women or men with small ears...try the fit before you buy.)The fit issue for my wife is why I deducted half a star.Battery life has averaged 3 days so about 8 hours of talk time...which is the best I have ever tested.Buttons are intuitive and easy, love the boom flip open to turn on and the volume controls...again best I have ever used ...One other quirky feature....not a knock...but a heads up...the power save feature....it turns the unit to sleep mode to safe battery life....it meant I had to touch the answer button and wait for the headset to awake before it would answer the call.  I only had a problem with this if i had roamed out of range.  As the unit was in sleep mode it did not warn me I was out of range...like say with a disconnection tone ...I got used to this and simply paid more attention to my distance to the phone...)I would buy another and recommend to anyone as with the caution of the fit issue for those with small ears.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWG4TUI" id="B00BWG4TUI-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-29:</strong> This is a ok bluetooth I actually bought two the first one work well but the second one no even two weeks..</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWG4TUI" id="B00BWG4TUI-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-19:</strong> I didn't buy my Bluetooth at amazon but this is the worst bluetooth ever. you cant turn your head or this awful Bluetooth will fall out of your ear. the sound is good but once you try to use it you cant. it hurts your ear it dose not stay in place. jabra what were you thinking when you made this.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWG4TUI" id="B00BWG4TUI-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-22:</strong> I have been using the Jabra Supreme for about a year when I received this Bluetooth.  I've been using it for several days now and find it as good as the Jabra Supreme.  In respect to comfort on the ear it is superior.  It is very light and can be worn for hours, in fact you will forget it is on.  The sound quality is comparable to the Supreme.  If you voice text, the Jabra Motion is superior.  I am able to text paragraphs through voice texting will little or no misunderstood errors.  I have not tried to sync it to any other devices outside of my Windows base HTC cell phone.  Another very nice feature is it has a full 7 hour talk time vs. the Supreme only has 5 hours.  This means it only has to be charged 1-2 times a week. I personally think that Jabra makes the best Bluetooth on the market.  I have tried them all, including the high end Plantronics Voyager, which in my view is not even in the same league as this Bluetooth.  The volume is unacceptable.  Additionally you have to pay extra for voice commands after one year which is also unacceptable..  If you make you living talking on the phone or making appointments this Bluetooth is the best choice you can make as far as functionality and clarity.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWG4TUI" id="B00BWG4TUI-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-29:</strong> The Jabra Motion is a great headset on its own, but isn't worth a price nearly twice that of comparable Plantronics headsets.For most high-end headsets these days, call quality is consistently high.  The Jabra Motion is no exception- callers heard me clearly and I heard them as well.  But for someone like me who has tried dozens of different headsets and carries no less than three headsets at any given time, the devil, as they say, is in the details.The Jabra Motion stands out above my go-to headset, thePlantronics Voyager PRO+, with two excellent features: an adjustable-height earpiece and the flip boom mic.  Unfortunately, it also has two features that don't stack up against the Plantronics: a poorly placed answer/hang-up button and a wonky volume control.The Great:The one and only thing I hate about my Plantronics Voyager is the on-off mechanic.  It requires me to locate a smallish button behind my ear, and press & hold for several seconds.  The Jabra, on the other hand, has a flip-mic that is so much faster and more intuitive.  The Jabra's earpiece also extends and retracts to find just the right height for maximum comfort.  I was initially worried that the earpiece would move around on its own, but the connection is pretty stiff, which means it stays put where I want it.  Between the custom-fit and light weight, I can wear this headset all day without noticing it.The Not-So-Great:One downside to the Jabra is a very large call button that fills the entire space on the outside of the earpiece.  Unfortunately, this translates into accidental hang-ups if I try to adjust the earpiece during a call.  The other nuisance with the Jabra is a touch-sensitive "swipe" volume control.  Rather than push buttons or a rocker switch to adjust the volume, you must swipe your finger up or down across the spine of the headset.  I'm sure some engineer thought himself very clever for coming up with the theory, but it's a nightmare in practise.  I learned quickly that I'm better off reaching for my phone to adjust the call volume.In spite of these minor annoyances, the Jabra Motion is actually becoming my favourite headset.  The light weight, custom comfort, and flip-mic happen to be the details that are most important to me.  However, at roughly $130 as of this writing, it's hard for me to recommend the Jabra to other buyers when the Plantronics VoyagerPRO+,Pro HD, andLegendare just as good, but closer to $70-80 each.  And, for bargain shoppers who don't need the latest-greatest, you just can't beat the value-pricedMotorola HX550for only about $30.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWG4TUI" id="B00BWG4TUI-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-21:</strong> Important things for a headset (in my opinion):Set-up: Pretty simple to pair with both my cell phone and my computer.  In actual use, it took me a bit to get down the call answer/hang-up/make call functions but it is like driving a stick shift- after a brief break-in, you'll be able to manage calls without thinking too hard about it.  I like the motion sensor call pick up (and call pick up when you unfold the boom). I cannot comment on dual pairing with two phones but I know others have had issues with it.  I actually like the big button but have learned how to adjust the headset on my ear without hanging up on people.Fit/Comfort: I like the behind-the-ear style as I am not fumbling with it like my motorola that I just stick in my ear.  I feel secure enough I can go walking, horsebackriding, etc. and the thing stays put.  For me this is a comfortable model, which is important to me.  I've tried several hands free sets and this is definately one of the more comfortable sets I've used.  I know other reviewers have had issues so that may be a deal-breaker for some purchasers.  Obviously one size does not fit all when it comes to ear pieces.  The positive is you can count on Amazon for an easy return if this doesn't fit you properly.Sound: Excellent sound, even in crowded places.  I guess that is attributable to the noise reduction feature.  I think it is excellent.  Aside from incoming, outgoing is great, too.  I have had any complaits from people I've called to 'speak up' or 'can you repeat that?'- even when I am outside and t is breezy or there is alot of ambient noise.  It has a boom microphone and I think the audio on this piece really is superior.Battery life: shorter than some sets but I would guess that the noise reduction and audio input draw a bit more on the battery.  It does have a long life when not being used.Volume control: the headset uses a swipe function for raising the volume.  This can be a pain but you can either get used to it or adjust from your phone.I do not wear glasses so I cannot comment on that issue- for those who do, an around-the-ear design may not be the ideal style.The voice control is 'meh' but that is not a significant feature to me.  If it is to you, you might want to try it out and see if you have success with using the voice control options.Overall, a great little headset that looks sleek and is relatively easy to use with great audio and comfort.  I definitely found it better than my motorola which was actually more expensive.  I recommend for those who can wear comfortably and deal with the brief learning curve to access the headsets functions.  I'm very happy with mine!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWG4TUI" id="B00BWG4TUI-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-14:</strong> Jabra is consistently a good bluetooth headset maker.  Right up there with Plantronics.  This Jabra Motion is no exception and is a great bluetooth headset.  Build quality seems to be good and not as cheap as some other bluetooth headsets from other manufacturers.  The boom mike flips back and forth smoothly.  Pairing with my Samsung Note 2 was a breeze.  The headset has the typical adjustments with ear gels and other adjustments to make this a comfortable fit.  It is one of the more comfortable headsets I have owned.But onto the most important thing, how does it perform.  From my usage it has performed great!  Sound quality is excellent and I have had people on the other end who say they can't tell I'm on a bluetooth headset.  It also adjusts the volume automatically based on your environment and it can be a noticeable different although not all the time.  I have never had any trouble hearing people I am talking too.  Overall sound quality and volume have been excellent.The other nice feature I like is the A2DP streaming.  That means I can stream music from things like Spotify on my phone right to the earpiece and listen to music.  While the sound won't be as good as headphones it is a great option.  Overall I am very happy with this headset and would recommend it.  The only con is I wish it was a little cheaper but then again you get what you pay for!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWG4TUI" id="B00BWG4TUI-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-14:</strong> I haven't used a bluetooth headset before so (a) I don't have anything else to compare this device to and (b) when I encounter issues, I can't be sure if it's a headset issue, a paired device issue, or a user issue.That said, I like the headset. I didn't find it so intuitive that I didn't need to use the operating manual (some Amazon reviews have been helpful as well), but it's not too tricky to pair the headset. I've successfully paired it to a Samsung Android phone, an iPod Touch, a Mac Mini, and a MacBook Air. My biggest issue has been that the headset seems to struggle to switch back and forth between these different devices - I often just re-start the pairing process to ensure things happen smoothly and fairly quickly.Sound and mic quality seem comparable to other wired head-sets that I've used - quite adequate. It charges fairly quickly from a micro-USB charger, and it seems to hold a charge pretty well.The headset is nice and light, and it fits comfortably in my ear. Because it comes with three different sized silicone gel ear pieces, I bet it will fit in your ear too.Two complaints about the control:1 - the volume control is a touch dial on the back of the headset, right behind your ear. The location is good, but it takes a number of strokes up (or down) to turn the volume up (or down).2 - the button you use the most (to answer, to hang-up, to connect, etc) is right on the ear-piece; it's easy to bump when you're trying to adjust the piece in your ear.Overall...pretty good.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWG4TUI" id="B00BWG4TUI-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-12:</strong> What I liked: Easy to pair to my iPhone, the voice commands (including answer and ignore - although someone said in a previous review you could not do this, you can), and the fact that the Jabra announces the caller's name. The sound quality was good.What I didn't like: It was too large for my ears, even with smallest ear plugs. However, I have this problem with all earpieces. I didn't like how you have to turn the volume up and down. I don't like that you have to go online to get a manual. Yes, it wasn't too hard to find, but it would have been nice to have a Quick Set Up sheet at least. And it's out of stock and has been for a while. How can you recommend something that has been out of stock for weeks?All in all a good product, but can you get something just as good for a cheaper prices?

This is the best Jabra I have used, though at the end of the day I would recommend a different product - theBose Bluetooth Headset Series 2 - Right Earwhich I have been using for the past 4 months and have been very satisfied with.Pros of the Jabra:-Pairing is greatly simplified over previous models. Voice prompts from the headset walk you through the process, give you the pin number required, and tells you when you are successful. (better than Bose)-The quality of the sound you hear is very good (as good for the most part as Bose)-I made a bunch of calls with this headset and the people I called all said the voice quality was very good (comparable to the Bose)-This Jabra is somewhat adjustable. You can extend the earphone boom a bit, which may help some people get a bit better fit (Bose is small and other than offering 3 different sized earbuds, does not adjust)-The volume controls are well placed (better than Bose)Cons of the Jabra:-There is one button for answering the phone, and it is in a bad place. I found myself repeatedly hitting it every time I adjusted the fit of the headset. It caused me to drop a couple of calls. I would get used to it eventually I guess but I'm sure that I will continue to at least occasionally hit this button unintentionally. (not nearly as good as Bose)-The big issue is comfort. I wear my headset all day at work. TheBose Bluetooth Headset Series 2 - Right Earis so comfortable that I often forget that I am wearing it. The Jabra on the other hand caused some irritation within the first hour and I had to give my ear a break before using it again.Furthermore the sound quality of the Bose was at least as good while indoors as the Jabra. I have not tried a comparison outdoors in windy conditions yet but that's not how I tend to use my headset.Verdict:Normally Bose products come at a huge price premium. In this case, the Bose is only slightly more expensive than the Jabra. Considering the significant difference in comfort, it's an easy decision - Bose.I did find one use that the Jabra is clearly superior for - long distance bike riding. I sometimes go on multi-hour bike rides, either in the gym or on bike trails near home. I sometimes need to stop and take a call - the Jabra outperforms the Bose in this case as its design makes it cling more securely to your ear than the Bose.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWG4TUI" id="B00BWG4TUI-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-01:</strong> The Jabra Motion is a neat looking earpiece with a few nice features however, I'm not sure they are game changersFor the review the following device and operation system was used.-Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket (AT&T; LTE)-Android 4.1.2 "Jelly Bean"Current Bluetooth Earpiece: Motorola HX550Pros-Nice folding boom mic-Height adjustment to better fit various ear sizes-Easy to pair with device via Bluetooth-The earpiece comes with a car charger adapter, wall charger and USB cable-Very comfortable-On/off switch is in the boom mic-Good sound quality-NFC pairing capability-Clear in windy situationsCons-There's no easy way to say it; the earpiece is just big-Occasionally I would get a screechy feedback during a call-Voice dial will never recognize my voice command-Long charging time verse other Bluetooth devices-Call button can easily be pushed by mistake with inserting the earpiece into the ear when receiving a call-More difficult to get on than my current deviceNeutral-The documentation set didn't come with instruction for pairing with NFC. You have to search for it on the websiteIf you like an over the ear Bluetooth earpiece the Jabra Motion is a nice choice. However, if you like a smaller, more portable earpiece you would be better off looking at a different earpiece.The ear is so big I will not use it when I travel or around town. I do think it's worth keeping on my desk and using it in the office similar to a Plantronics type device for a land line.UPDATE: I got the touch sensor volume to work and I really like that feature. I took that piece off the above Pros and Cons.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWG4TUI" id="B00BWG4TUI-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-14:</strong> I almost did not get this. First of all I had read reviews of people complaining of the position of the receive calls button.  Well first of all when a call comes in you have to press that button to get the call so you start off by pressing it in right off the bat. So I don't know why they had to tinker with it after that.  And if they chose to  you can. Second of all there were reviews about the battery time being better. I don't know what they were talking about. I start using it at Seven in the morning and there are times when it is Nine oclock and I still have it and it has only used up not even a third of the battery, and I am self employed with two crews in the field with formen. Also the wind, I am out in the field, a customer understanding me correctly is important, I found that people heard me fine when I was outside.

In addition, I found that people had a hard time hearing me, as well as the controls being frustrating and out of my line of sight.  Because of this, I almost always used the larger and more obvious over-the-head units with a boom mic.  Hardly discrete for wearing as one shopped, etc.  In addition, since these sets were usually wired, it meant that when our granddaughter was with us, the wire was a continual distraction as she tried to grab and pull it, further making it annoying.This headset is wonderful!  It doesn't irritate my ear at any point, and adjusts enough to accommodate my ear size. I can hear clearly, and everyone is able to hear me clearly.  The on/off is simple too, as is picking up a call, pairing with the phone OR the computer, and it works just fine with Skype as well.  It was a bit trickier to pair with the computer than it was the phone, but it was still do-able.  While the sound via telephone was reported by the call recipient as crystal clear and undistorted, call recipients via Skype said there was some "tin can" effect.  In comparison to a wired headset with noise cancelling, this one does pick up more of the background sounds and transmits those as well, but remains within the realm of "acceptable" but a detail to remember if you happen to be one who is prone to fidgeting while on the phone (tapping, keyboard sounds, etc. were all picked up) Like other bluetooth devices, it is also sensitive to the operation of other electrical items in its vicinity although the call recipient did not hear the same distortion that I did (washing machine motor was our test).My prior experience with Jabra headsets had all been in the low end of their price spread, and this one far exceeds those, as well as exceeds the performance of other brands of headsets in similar price range as where this one is currently priced by Amazon.  It's also the best performance I've ever experienced with any bluetooth headset.  I can't say whether it would perform well in high noise environments such as diesel truck motors, plant noises, traffic, etc. as I am rarely in that type of location when trying to use a headset.Another great feature is that the device tells you exactly how much talk time is left on it--no more worries about when the battery is going to give out.  With talk time in excess of six hours, it should last for almost anyone throughout an entire day.Overall, this is the best headset I've ever tried, and I'm very pleased with its performance.  It's comfortable to wear, has good battery life, good sound, a good microphone, and is reliable in its performance.  The only question I have is what the overall durability will be.  I've had a number of devices begin to fail after a month or so.  I'll update the durability  when it does begin to fail.  After all, nothing lasts forever!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWG4TUI" id="B00BWG4TUI-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-01:</strong> Best experience is your own.

Downloaded the Jabra connect app and helped modify the headset even more.  Comfortable, well better then all the ones I've tried, Jawbone (everyone), Plantronics voyager legend, etc.  It's sooo much better then those I've just mentioned.

My needs and expectations are very simple. The obvious, of course, is clear voice reproduction on both ends. I want it to fit comfortably and want the basic functions to be simple to understand and easy to access. I want the bluetooth pairing to happen easily without frustration.  But the one area that seems the most simple to engineer but has been the most elusive is simply that it has enough volume.  That seems to always be the detail that consistently falls short.  What would remedy that problem in most any headset is simply that the earpiece has a snug, secure fit and it extends into the inner ear canal so that sound has an undistracted path to follow. Our individual outer ears are almost as unique as our fingerprints and so there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Most manufacturers include several sizes of plastic or foam to snap on and provide the best fit for our unique contours.  This Jabra is not perfect, but to date it has the best fit and so I don't need to strain to hear my caller, especially when I'm driving.  If my Plantronics Voyager only fit better, I believe it would slightly edge out the Jabra.  But because the fit and volume are superior, at least for me,  Jabra Motion is now my go to headset. One feature I like as well is that to turn it off, you simply angle in the beam that holds the microphone.  That prevents draining the battery when not in use. I like the touch sensitive area that allows me to increase or decrease the volume by just brushing my finger up or down.  I prefer that to fishing for a button that then requires a push, which can dislodge it's fit. The noise canceling works great. To test it I walked gradually closer to a huge floor fan and the caller noticed no change in voice clarity and heard no noise.  Very impressive. You can't go wrong with Plantronics, arguably the leaders of the headset industry. But for now, this Jabra Motion has become my favorite.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWG4TUI" id="B00BWG4TUI-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-27:</strong> This is a pretty decent bluetooth headset. Setup is a BREEZE, as soon as you are done charging it, the bluetooth device actually talks you through on getting things set up. I like the little notifications it will give on occasion, such as how much talk-time battery remains. The sound is great and I haven't had anybody complain so far of being unable to hear me. I haven't even had anybody guess I was on a bluetooth, which is encouraging. The call quality on the receiving end is also great! There aren't a lot of controls, which are good and bad. Personally, I prefer working the controls on my phone, but I know a lot of people prefer them on the device itself. Volume and answer is all I need, and that is what comes with this. I prefer less controls so I'm not accidentally hitting the wrong buttons, so this works best for me.My only complaint is comfort. Because it sits on the top of your ears it takes a while to get used to it for prolonged periods of time. The first time I put it on I almost yanked it off swearing to never wear it again. After playing with it for a while I got somewhat comfortable with it, but then I started noticing it a few hours later. I've yet to get through an entire day without becoming annoyed with it at one point or another. Taking it off for a break is often welcomed.Overall, Jabra makes great headsets and this isn't an exception.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWG4TUI" id="B00BWG4TUI-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-15:</strong> Before writing this review I used Jabra MOTION paired with an iPhone 5 for 30 days.  I found the Jabra to be a solid performing headset but it fell short when compared to thePlantronics M50 - Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Blackwhich is 1/4 the price.  Range, clarity, battery life, and usability are all excellent with the Jabra.  Due to its larger size however, the headset can sometimes be difficult to secure to your ear and it feels heavy compared to similar devices.  The volume button is also difficult to use, as well as the mute button, which duplicates your phone's mute function and can be confusing.  Voice prompts are exceptional and when you turn the device on, it tells you the hours of remaining battery life.  I noticed no material improvements with the "motion" technology that supposedly improves mic performance when you're in motion.Size:My biggest complaint with the Jabra is its large size.  Unlike the Plantronics M50 which has a fairly small footprint, the Jabra is very noticeable by others and awkward to use in public.  Also, when folded for storage, the Jabra is much larger in your pocket than similar devices.  For this reason, I use it exclusively in my office.Sound Quality and Range:The Jabra's sound quality is exceptional.  Jabra maintains a reliable connection for twice the distance of the Plantronics M50.  The Jabra's larger battery probably allows is to consume more power, so you can definitely expect more range than smaller devices.  Also, during my 30 days of initial use, I never experienced connection problems between the headset and phone.Ease of Use:The Jabra is easy to use but as mentioned above, the volume and mute controls are confusing.  The volume control is difficult to operate and lacks tactile feedback.  The mute control duplicates that of your phone's - for example, if you mute your phone and the headset, you need to un-mute both to talk.  To avoid confusion, I only used the mute function on my phone.Overall Rating:I like the Jabra MOTION headset.  However, when compared to the Plantronics M50, the Jabra falls short mainly on price and size.  All other features like sound quality and battery life between the two devices are comparable.  For this reason, it's difficult to highly recommend the Jabra over other options.  If you're looking for a large battery and excellent range, this headset might be worth the extra cost.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWG4TUI" id="B00BWG4TUI-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-20:</strong> Premium quality Bluetooth headsets keep getting better and better.  I've been using them for years as my job requires talking to customers on the phone constantly, often in crowded or noisy places like airports.  I've discovered that for the serious business user, you need a boom microphone - the ultra small headsets just don't work.  For that reason, I've been less than satisfied with some of the smaller offers from Jabra in the past, and I keep coming back to the Plantronics Voyager line.  I used a Voyager 510 years ago, and today use aPlantronics Voyager Legend Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black(though I've tried many other earpieces in the middle).It's hard to review a headset in isolation, so I will compare this to my headset of choice, the Plantronics Voyager Legend.  Cutting to my conclusion, I will say that while Jabra got much right with the Motion, it has some serious shortcomings.  I will go back to my Plantronics and do not recommend this headset, but as with all of my reviews, you need to decide for yourself.  Some deal killers for me might not matter to you.  Overall, the sound and clarity slightly exceed the Plantronics Voyager Legend, but the user features take it down in my mind.  There are many good things to recommend this headset, just not in the areas of concern for me.  Read each area and decide for yourself.Size and WeightThe Jabra Motion is very similar in size and weight to my Voyager Legend (actually a bit lighter at 6.1 oz), but instead of having a boom mic that extends from the speaker, the boom mic extends from the bottom of the earpiece itself.  The microphone flips up for storage.  Flipping it down will automatically answer a call, as will placing the earpiece on your ear.ComfortAs seems to be standard today, the earpiece comes with a silicone gel ear insert pre-installed, with a smaller and a larger one in the box for different sized ears.  I'm a medium kind of guy, so the medium earpiece always works for me.  The ear bud itself is on an extendable post so the height from the top of your ear to the bud can be adjusted.  This is a really nice feature, but I found it didn't help the fit too much.  I was able to get it on my ear and it feels reasonably snug, but the Plantronics Voyager Legend has a larger loop to go over the ear itself and seems to hold on better.  Both are reasonably comfortable, but I found the Jabra didn't stay on quite as snugly.  Your ear shape might be different from mine, but these were my experiences.ChargingOn the latest Plantronics Voyager Legend, I was quite disappointed that they switched from a standard micro-USB to a proprietary magnetic connector.  They also only include a USB cable with a charger for AC wall voltage.  Kudos to Jabra for sticking with a standard micro-USB connector, and also for including both a wall charger and a car charger!  Charging this is a breeze.Battery LifeThis headset is fully compatible with the battery display on my iPhone, and it has an admirable 7 hours of talk time at full charge.  When first connected, a voice tells you the talk time left.  I just reviewed a pair ofJabra REVO Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headphones - Retail Packaging - Black.  Those must be made by a different team at Jabra because they do not tell you the time left.  In terms of announcing battery life and the total battery life, these are quite comparable to my Plantronics Voyager Legend.  Unlike the Plantronics Voyager Legend, Jabra does not have aPlantronics Voyager Legend Charge Case - Frustration-Free Packaging - Blackfor getting even longer battery life.Controls - PhysicalUnfortunately, this is where the headset really fell down in my mind.  If I could pick one reason I can't use it, it would be the large "answer" button on the outside surface of the ear bud.  If you try to push your finger against the ear piece to make it fit more snugly in your ear, you automatically push the "answer/hangup" button.  Plantronics put this button on the back surface of the ear bud, so you did not accidentally hit it when you pushed it into your ear.  Jabra made the button huge and put it right on the outside surface.  I have already hung up on people twice when I went to push the earpiece into my ear better.  This is unacceptable, and just poor design in my mind.  Also, if you click the button twice you "ignore" the call, and I've found myself doing that as well.The volume control was also not well executed.  It does adjust volume via Bluetooth and not locally on the headset (a good feature), but it is a touch dial which takes quite a bit of pushing to activate.  Sliding your finger top to bottom does not give you continuous volume control.  You have to slide your finger over the entire control to drop or raise the volume by 1 "setting".  So going to full volume from quiet can take more than 5 full swipes over the ear, and sometimes it doesn't register and you have to reswipe.I did like the mute control on the end of the boom microphone.  It is nice to have a true mute button on a headset (Plantronics has similar)Controls - VoiceThere is a voice control which you can activate when off a call by pushing the "mute" button.  From there you can voice dial, and this seemed to work reasonably well.  However, the Plantronics added a voice control to "answer" or "ignore" calls.  I've gotten so used to this feature that I can't believe Jabra doesn't have it.  It is quite convenient to answer when your arms are full, and I am surprised that the voice control here lacks this feature.BluetoothPairing was fast, but the voice in the headset did not differentiate between Phone 1 (the iPhone 4) and Phone 2 (my iPad) when I paired them.  Multipoint is extremely important to me, or the ability to switch quickly between two different devices.  I found this headset got confused easily.  Despite pairing to two devices successfully, it did not seem able to adeptly switch between them.  Sometimes it would switch, sometimes it would crackle after the switch, and sometimes it wouldn't do anything.  The Jabra Revo headphones I have do a great job, so perhaps that team can help their coworkers out.  Lacking decent multipoint support is a tough sell for me when buying a new headset.DocumentationToo many electronics manufacturers are now relying on online manuals.  I get this for less expensive tools, but for $130, don't tell me to go online to learn how to use NFC pairing.  There's also no list of voice commands in the manual - you need to ask the headset to tell you the voice commands.  The navigation voice in the headset itself is creepy.  It's odd, because once again my Jabra Revo headphones have a nice voice.Sound Quality and Noise CancellationIt may sound strange that I saved this for the end of the review, but honestly I have found that the major headset manufacturers seem to have converged on good high end designs that do the job they need to do.  The sound was crisp and loud in my ear piece, and everyone I called said I sounded wonderful.  Background noise was effectively canceled and my conversations were crisp and clear.  In fact, it seemed a bit better than my Plantronics Voyager Legend, but honestly, both are excellent devices as far as sound quality is concerned.My conclusion?  I gave my Plantronics headset of choice just 4 stars because it had some issues preventing it from being 5 stars.  I was going to rate this Jabra Motion 3 stars because it is a good headset, just not as good as very similar market competitor.  Upon further consideration, I think it deserves 4 stars.  Just like the Plantronics, it is not perfect, but it is a good headset that just doesn't fit my needs due to the fit on the head and the large sized hang-up button on the outside surface.  I hope my review was helpful - this headset might be for you, but it just really wasn't for me.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWG4TUI" id="B00BWG4TUI-review21" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-13:</strong> Summary:  This is a great bluetooth earpiece.  Its around the back fit is unique and comfortable, and its contoured earpiece is great for fit and noise blocking.  I have tried this as well as aPlantronics Voyager, aJawbone ERA, and aJawbone ICON.  On balance, this is my favorite, but they're all close enough that it's going to come down to personal preference.  I'll try to break down the differences to help you chose, but IMHO you're best off checking out a store where you can try them out.Sound Performance:  A tie, with the slight edge to the Motion on noise blocking.  I'm not an audiophile, but all of the earpieces have great sound.  They're all mono, but sounds are rich enough to listen to music in a pinch, and are great for calls, podcasts, etc.  I do think that the Motion's contoured earpiece (it's shaped like the inside of your ear and fits a little more snugly) blocks out exterior sound from the ear it's in a little better than the other three, which I appreciate).  All four oversell their noise cancellation slightly, IMHO.  With all of them, I can make a call with the car radio on and the earpiece cancel most but not all of the radio sound.  Calls in light wind are fine with all four, but heavy wind gets choppy.Bluetooth Performance: The Motion has been a little buggy with my iPhone 4s.  Most of the time it's fine - the call button activates Siri, it answers and hangs up fine, but occasionally some of my apps sporadically fail to recognize the earpiece.  It shows up as a choice of output devices, but the sound just won't play unless I reconnect by turning the earpiece off and back on.  I haven't had this issue with any of the other earpieces, but it's not a major issue and might get fixed in firmware update.Fit: I think the Motion wins on fit, with the Voyager coming in second.  The around the ear design plus a contoured earpiece produces a very comfortable, stable fit.  The Jawbone earpieces are small enough that they are designed to fit mostly through friction (although they do come with optional earloops).Battery and charging:  The Motion is the overall winner in this category, IMHO.  Its bigger body gives it longer performance than the Jawbone earpieces, and I appreciate that it has a micro-usb charging port, which lets me use a variety of easily available charging cables or adapters.  (Jawbone is also micro-B, but the Plantronics uses a non-standard magnetic cable that is very cool, but that I don't personally like because I'd like all my devices to use the same cable).Style: This is a matter of personal preference, I think the Jawbones look the coolest.  They're the smallest and also the most stylish, so they win on both appearance fronts.  (Especially the Icon, which is tiny).  This looks cool in kind of a sci-fi way, though, so it's not bad.Design: This has a lot of features.  If you lift the boom on the front it turns off, or you can drop the boom to turn it on or answer calls.  There's a "call/answer/hangup button" on the outside of the ear column, and a "mute/voice control" button on the end of the boom.  Some reviewers report problems with accidentally hanging up on calls, but I haven't had that problem.Brains: I'm not a great reviewer for the high-end brains of these things, and apologize for that.  The Motion has all kinds of voice commands, and you can download apps to customize various settings, like whether or not an LED shows when you are on the phone.  Check out the other reviews to see what other people think about that.Price: The prices will vary, so I'll let you compare those yourself.  The Icon is a generation or two old, so it will probably be a lot cheaper, but the others should be comparable.Conclusion: The new high end earpieces are close enough that choosing one is going to be a matter of personal preference.  After trying four of them out pretty extensively, I slightly prefer the Motion, but definitely try them out yourself and see.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWG4TUI" id="B00BWG4TUI-review22" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-07:</strong> I have used several Jabra headsets over the years, and, by far, the JABRA MOTION BLUETOOTH MONO HEADSET is my favorite!  First of all, the pairing was the easiest of any bluetooth device I have ever paired. You just charge the headset, turn it on, put it in your ear, the voice tells you to go here, here, here on your phone, and voila!  Your headset is paired to your phone in just seconds!Second, the JABRA MOTION BLUETOOTH MONO HEADSET has a nice clear sound in both directions.  In my ear, voices are clear and fairly true; I have no problems understanding anyone.  With my friends, family, and coworks that I have asked, my voice is clear and easy to hear...none of that "in an echo chamber" effect that everyone hates so much.Third, the noise cancellation works very well.  With my test subjects, I tried getting ice out of the refrigerator door, using the blender, clinking dishes as they were removed from the diswasher, and loud, interupting children.  Almost all of the noise was removed; I had one person who thought they heard crinkling paper, but that was really the ice dispenser!  So, I would definitely say that the JABRA MOTION BLUETOOTH MONO HEADSET noise cancellation feature is excellent.Fourth, the fit.  The JABRA MOTION BLUETOOTH MONO HEADSET comes with earbuds in three sizes; the smallest works best for me.  I love the over the ear design to keep it firmly in place.  The style were you just push it into your ear like Lieutenant Uhura's ear piece drive me nuts and always fall out.  Overall, the JABRA MOTION BLUETOOTH MONO HEADSET is light weight and comfortable.  You can actually forget you have it on.Fifth, the JABRA MOTION BLUETOOTH MONO HEADSET has a good, long batter life inbetween charges.  After changing fully, the nice lady in your ear will tell you that you have 7 hours of talk time.  I work from home and am on the phone all day long.  Not having to remember to recharge the headset between meeings is a vast improvement over previous Jabra headsets.Sixth, the contols are obvious and easy to use.  You don't need any divine inspiration to figure them out.  I like that in a headset.So, there you have it.  My six top reasons of why you should try the JABRA MOTION BLUETOOTH MONO HEADSET.  After trying several dozen headsets over the years, both wired and wireless, IMHO, the JABRA MOTION BLUETOOTH MONO HEADSET tops them all.FYI:  here is what comes in the Box: Headset, charger, usb cord, car charger attachment, extra ear buds (large, medium, and small), and really good instructions.  Pretty much everything you need.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWG4TUI" id="B00BWG4TUI-review23" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-25:</strong> Let the games marvelous headset games.  If your anything like me, you've had just about every make headset.  I've had them all, we all have.  Some better than others but I've never found one that I was in love with.  Since then I've tried dozens upon dozens of different Bluetooth headsets; they have ranged from great to mediocre to downright bad. I have found that the "great" Bluetooth headsets I've used have consistently come from one of two companies - Jabra or Plantronics.  So here comes the Jabra motion.  The Jabra Motion looked pretty in its clear plastic shell; so pretty that I felt a little bit bad about freeing it from its box. Once completely unboxed however, I was pleased to see that the device not only looked good but seemed to be thoughtfully designed as well.  It returns to the "curve around the ear design" which works for many people.  The design of the Jabra Motion headset is important, since the best Bluetooth headsets are ones you can comfortably wear throughout the day. You know, the Bluetooth headsets you don't feel the need to take on and off, and that don't cause "ear fatigue" because of the pressure they put on some portion of your ear or head. This Headset is amazingly comfortable and stands out in that respect. This surprised me since it is rather large, and it literally wraps around your ear. This headset is bigger than many of the headsets I've owned in recent years -- along with the excellent design -- allows for the proper distribution of weight. The result is a headset that sits comfortably on your ear without placing too much pressure on any one spot.  Add in the fact that the earpiece not only swivels and allows you to use the headset on either the left or the right ear, but it also has a movable post so that you can adjust the height of the portion that sits in your ear, and you now have a headset that offers as close to a custom fit as you're going to find without it being a custom fit.  I have been wearing this headset as much as possible since it arrived last week, so I could test its comfort over extended periods of use; I have to say that it is one of the most comfortable headsets I have ever used.SETTING UP THE JABRA MOTIONJabra recommends charging the device fully before using it for the first time.  After an hour and a half the battery icon glowed green and the Motion was ready for pairing. A fully charged battery should yield six hours of uninterrupted use and a depleted battery will only take two hours to fully recharge.Pairing the headset to my phone was effortless. Upon folding down the descriptively named "boom-arm," the headset came to life. It was just a moment before the reason behind the user's manual thinness was revealed: all of the instructions are presented in audio form through the earbud when the Motion is turned on for the first time. I disregarded the instructions on how to pair the headset via Bluetooth because I wanted to utilize Jabra's newly implemented NFC (near-field communication) technology support. All I had to do was physically touch the Motion to the back of my NFC enabled smart phone (the Samsung Galaxy S3) and a moment later I received confirmation that the two had paired. It was perhaps the most painless pairing process I've ever encountered. Pairing the Motion to my computer required the usual authentication process, yet was made easier by the audio instructions.So how is the audio quality on the Jabra Motion Headset? In a word it's fantastic. Yes, I said it FFFAAANNNTTTAAASSSTIC.  I'm not using the word lightly. I just spent some time on the phone while driving to and walking around New York City and I've asked people who I'm talking to how the headset sounds.  They have used words like "amazing" and "fantastic". Yes, while driving with the windows closed the connection was perfect and it didn't sound like I was using a headset at all. That was true even when I was speaking in a whisper. Things changed a bit when I opened the window and let the wind rush by my head while driving at about 65 miles an hour. But the worst it got was, "Now it sounds like you are on any headset." That means that with the window opens at 60 miles an hour the Jabra Motion Bluetooth Headset was as good or better than most Bluetooth headsets are in a quiet room. That's rather impressive.All this held true on my end of the conversation as well, and while I know I'm sounding a bit too enthusiastic I honestly can't help it - this headset sounds better than any headset I have ever used. I also used the headset to access Siri and to do voice recognition on my iPhone.  The convenience of activating Siri by simply touching the headset was great, and the accuracy of the voice-to-text transcription was as good as I have seen. That tells me that the audio signal the phone is receiving from the headset is clean and crisp, and it vastly improves the ability to text by voice on the fly.This is the best headset I've ever used.  I'm planning on purchasing 1 for my wife and one for the house phone.  This is a must have for anyone using a headset.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWG4TUI" id="B00BWG4TUI-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-24:</strong> Wow. This is really something else.  The real test of a blue tooth set is how you sound to other and they sound to you.  This passes the "I had no idea you were on a Bluetooth headset" test!  The sound is clear and completely noise-free!  I don't like headsets, they usually bug my ear. However, this is one very comfortable earpiece. It seems rather bulky and like it may not stay put when you are putting it on, however, once it is in place on your ear, the piece fits so well you barely know it is there.  This is truly a top of the line headset that is great for people who need to used them on the go all day and night. Easy to learn and use controls, and if you have NFC perimeter pairing it works with that.  Great range, intuitive controls, comfortable, truly the best in it's class!

It includes three differntly-SHAPED tips for your ears, not just the usual differently-sized tips. When a call comes in, the Jabra announces the caller's name, a feature not found on thePlantronics Voyager Pro HD, a comparable high-end bluetooth set. Volume is easy to control, and call initiation and ending is simple, too.There are two big cons with this bluetooth, and they could be deal-breakers. The whole MOTION tends to fall off the ear if you move your head vigorously, even if you feel you have a good fit (the MOTION is light on the ear, but doesn't really grip the ear in any way). In a humorous demonstration I put the MOTION in one ear and thePlantronics Voyager Pro HDin the other, and pretended to be in a vigorous conversation; the Jabra went flying. Really, this just isn't what I want when I'm driving. The other problem with the MOTION is the lack of boom adjustability. There are two positions; open/on, and closed/off. Too bad about your beard, collar, or earrings!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWG4TUI" id="B00BWG4TUI-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-08:</strong> My boyfriend has tried many headset options over the years, and he currently enjoys his Motorola H19txt Universal Bluetooth Headset. We decided to test out this Jabra to see how it compared.First, the unit is fairly sizeable, especially compared with the H19txt. He uses the smallest size on the Jabra and even so he'd like to go smaller to have it fit properly. He's 5'10" so an average sized male. The silicon piece which hooks on and goes into the ear doesn't seal well - it sits on rather than in. So max volume isn't always loud enough, depending on the environment.It's reasonably comfortable to wear for multiple hours at a stretch. However when he does have to swap ears, it's not as easy as other devices. You have to pull out and rotate pieces, all while carefully avoiding the "call" button so it doesn't try to do something. The volume control is functional, but a little hokey. He'd prefer a typical rocker switch for more precise control.Given the price he was surprised at the less than 8 hour battery life. Also, the connection was a bit flaky. With other headsets, he had no problem listening to an audio book, having a call come in, taking the call, and going back to the book. With this headset the sequence would often disconnect the headset, requiring him to turn the headset off and on again to reconnect.It's also disconnected from the phone even though the phone's right there on his belt.On the up side the sound quality is fairly good. When he opens his car window, the headset adjusts and the call is still easy to hear on both ends. The mute function is a nice feature.So we'll give this a 3.5 stars given the disconnect issues. There's no reason we'd want to use this when the H19txt works so much better and is smaller.We received a review copy of this unit through the Amazon vine program.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWG4TUI" id="B00BWG4TUI-review28" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-14:</strong> The Jabra Motion Bluetooth headset with intelligent motion sensor technology, made in China, is designed to work with iOS and android Bluetooth enabled devices. Built in technologies include NFC pairing, an energy saving nap mode, noise blackout, and A2DP multimedia streaming.  The battery lasts for up to seven hours of talk time or fifteen hours of standby time.  multiple eargels and adjustable parts allow a personalized fit for every user.  The CONNECT iOS and android app customizes your headset to provide the best experience.The package includes the Jabra motion headset, an ultimate comfort eargel, an AC charger, a car charger, and the quick start manual.  Pairing was simple, and then required downloading apps for customizing.  From then on, the headset connected effortlessly when turned on.Voice controls cover basic commands.  For audio play back, I had to say "phone controls" to the Motion headset, then tell Siri to "play music."  Other accepted phrases include redial, call back, battery, pair new device, and cancel.  Pressing the call button during periods of inactivity will indicate if connected and the battery time left.  Pressing the voice button and saying battery will only provide the latter information.I climb stairs in a building to train for a charity hike to Yosemite in June 2013, and decided to use the headset to listen to podcasts while going up and down the numerous flights.  There were no issues to listening to the podcasts until my hair became sweaty.  Any moisture falling from my hair onto the volume pad caused the volume to quickly decrease to mute.  This isn't a situation I would consider to be normal, but it did point out a limitation if you plan on using the headset outdoors on a hot summer day.Then after two weeks of use, the Jabra Motion Bluetooth headset started to randomly and repeatedly turn off and on, typically several times a minute, for no apparent reason rendering the headset completely useless.  I contacted Jabra by email and was told the problem was likely due to a Bluetooth communications error, and I needed to reset the Motion headset and reconnect it to the phone.To reset the Jabra Motion, I was told to make sure the unit was powered off. Then press and hold the CALL and VOICE buttons simultaneously, and extend the microphone arm without releasing the buttons. Keep pressing the buttons for a few seconds until the battery light powers on white / purple. Release the buttons and the headset will get into pairing mode automatically, ready to connect.After doing this several times with no resolution, I contacted Jabra again.  This time I received no response.  Since I am required to submit Amazon Vine reviews within a short time period of receiving an item, I'm unable to pursue resolution any further to remain in compliance.  The product has failed, and Jabra has not responded to a request for assistance at any time in the last week.  If you're looking for a quality Bluetooth headset backed by a company ready to offer support, look elsewhere.PROS:Listen to music with A2DP multimedia streamingNoise blackout, dual microphones, and app aid in clearer communications1 year warrantyCONS:No direct voice commands to control audioFailed after two weeksJabra support unresponsive</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWG4TUI" id="B00BWG4TUI-review29" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-13:</strong> I really, really wanted to like this headset.

I found the sound quality of the Jabra motion to be quite good, comparable to my Plantronics Voyager.  This headset has a few quirks that will keep it from being my "go to" headset:Too easy to disconnect a call unintentionally -- the large button on the outside of the earpiece makes it much too easy to accidentally disconnect callsDoes not stay well seated on my ear -- this headset never feels like it's completely settled and it is very easy to shake it off my earthe Motion controls -- I keep a headset on for hours.  If I'm sitting still typing this headset will go on and off (and tell me about it!) repeatedly.  It's quite annoying actuallyPairing -- while it pairs easily, it seems to drop the pair equally easilyUnadjustable boom -- this is a female problem but the boom interferes with many of my earrings.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWG4TUI" id="B00BWG4TUI-review34" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-16:</strong> Getting right to the point, I own a Bose Bluetooth Series 2 and this Jabra MOTION.

Use the headsets extensively (several hours/day) for work and whenever talking while driving.  I've have tested many bluetooth headsets and currently use thePlantronics Voyager Proheadset.This headset meets and passes my primary requirement... the microphone and speaker quality is good.  Hard to believe how many other headsets can't live up to the basic requirement for microphone/speaker quality.Other notable shining points... the headset fits my ear and is comfortable (once I figured out the process for putting it on, very different than my current headset), the volume is good, I very much like the folding boom to turn off the headset for carrying in my pocket (massive positive that you don't get butt dials this way).  Also, when charging, it is very clear when it is done.Because of the positives, this headset enters the limited category of 2 headsets that I can live with (out of many that I have tried)... this one (the Jabra Motion) and the Plantronics Voyager.I gave the Jabra Motion 4 stars because there are some notable areas for improvement (and didn't give it 3 stars because, even with the annoyances, this is a nice headset... it's just that it can be so much better).Concerns:- Glitches waking up.  While using the headset, if leaving it in my ear without turning it off (folding the boom), it seems to go to sleep.  If I receive a call... it doesn't always wake up properly and answer the call.  I am forced to fold and unfold the boom to reliably pick up a call on my iPhone 4s.- The button on the headset to pickup/hangup/redial is very easy to bump when adjusting the headset in my ear.  I got tired of thinking "arrrgh, I did it again" when adjusting the headset- Volume control is gimmicky.  It is a touch sensor that I did not like at all.  My hair would constantly get it the way of using it.- Mobile app for the phone... limited use, waste of time.  Nothing worse than an app the provides almost no value.Missed Opportunity with the Mobile App:I think Jabra missed an great opportunity with their mobile app for the headset.  The limited use functionality that it has is a waste of time to spend downloading.  However, the opportunity is to add the ability to tweak all kinds of features I would love love LOVE to be able to tweak... for example.  Turn off double-click re-dialing.  That feature is a bane for me... hate it in all headsets and would like it to go away.  So, set a feature in the app to default to it on and let me undo it.  Same thing for other features... give me the ability to set a default power-up volume.  So, if I adjust the volume in a noisy or quiet environment, and later use the headset, it goes back to what I want it to be.  I'm sure with a little thought, a whole slew of options would come to light.  Develop an app that improves my use of this product... be a differentiator versus the waste of time that it is now.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWG4TUI" id="B00BWG4TUI-review36" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-25:</strong> As ridiculous as bluetooth headsets look--and can we all just admit they look very, very silly--and as annoying as those that wear them constantly can be, having one for in-car use is still fairly essential if you want to use your phone. Yes, you can pair your phone with (most) car sound systems, but shouting on speaker phone isn't really that awesome either. So, if you want/need to use your cellphone while driving your choices are A) look a psychotic talking to yourself  and/or a self-important jerk by using a bluetooth headset or B) look like an equally crazy loon by shouting yourself hoarse and over again and banging your head on the steering wheel when the person on the other end of the line asks you to repeat yourself for the third time with a speakerphone. Or maybe all of the above is just me ...So, having established a bluetooth headset as a necessary at times, but not necessarily welcome evil, I tried out the Jabra Motion. First and foremost, I found it almost instantly uncomfortable. The way it fit over my ear and the size of the bud that goes into your ear. I liked both those elements a lot less than the Plantronics I've used. For my husband, it wasn't as noticeably "pinchy" so your mileage may vary. The weight was about the norm for these sorts of units and I didn't fit it either enviably light, or oppressively heavy.In terms of sound quality I found this good, to very good. I had no trouble hearing callers, or having them hear me ... Or at least no more trouble than is normal via cell phone. Ending calls was a little spotty, but I think that's more just a matter of getting used to the headset and the button's placement and how hard you have to press. The volume though is really poorly located and activated. I basically had to take it off in order to adjust and then, if it wasn't right, take it off and try again. Annoying.My other gripe is that the large in-ear portion fit so tightly that it definitely effected my hearing when it was in, so it's not the type of thing I'd like to leave on and, as annoying as it is to put on, I hate to fiddle with taking something on/off to answer the phone or make a call. That's a huge drawback in my book.As for pairing, it was quick, easy and successful with by my and my husband's iPhones (4s and 5, respectively), so no dings there. And, all in all, this worked pretty well.Overall, though I hate to give wishy-washy advice, I think the most important thing about a bluetooth headset, since sound quality has sort of stabilized across the board at this point, is how comfortable it is to YOU. What I find great, you might awful, and vice versa. I'd encourage everyone to try a few one before committing to one brand. Otherwise, it's kind of a trial and error process.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWG4TUI" id="B00BWG4TUI-review37" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-19:</strong> This is a decent headset, the noise cancellation is quite good, never got a single complaint, battery life is good as well. Sadly the headset fails on several levels:1. The call button is placed on the ear piece which will you'll be adjusting constantly. I've made numerous accidental calls fidgeting with the placement of the ear piece.2. When connecting the headset to my iPhone it insisted I download two apps-- one of which required a registration key which was not included in the box. I don't think that app was actually supposed to be used with this headset.3. The headset had some weird distortion at times which seemed to be unrelated to distance from the phone. I looked for a firmware update to fix the issue but no such luck. Could not recommend headset until such time as this is fixed.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWG4TUI" id="B00BWG4TUI-review38" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-08:</strong> I regularly use a BlueAnt headset and thus compare any new headsets to my tested and trusted one. I'm not impressed with Jabra MOTION and here's why:- the fit leaves much to be desired. It kept falling out of my ear even with repeated attempts to get it to "sit" right- I had no trouble pairing it with my phone, but I did have trouble with keeping the phone paired- I attempted to use the voice commands to answer calls with no success- I tried using it in the airport and the "adjust to motion and environment" function was non-existent</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BWG4TUI" id="B00BWG4TUI-review39" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-30:</strong> The two are similar in physical design, but there are huge differences in the details.  The Motion is much more expensive, but in my opinion, the Jabra MOTION blows the WAVE out of the water.Key differences:More comfortable - The MOTION's earpiece can rotate on it's shaft and can slide up and down to adjust for different ear sizes.  The WAVE's earpiece is on a flexible shaft, but the distance between the earpiece and the top-of-the-ear curve is fixed.More Functions - The Motion has a number of voice-activated commands while the Wave is your basic earphone.Much better fidelity - There's no comparison when listening to music through the two headsets.  The Motion sounds good.  The Wave is just this side of awful.Volume adjustment - The Motion has a panel that you slide your finger against.  The Wave has a rocker switch.My conclusion...If the extra cost isn't a problem, buy the Motion.  The Wave is still a good headset, but this is infinitely better.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00BWG4TUI', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00BWG4TUI', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00D1RR52K</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00D1RR52K</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

My iPhone 5 sits perfectly in the slot and I don't even have to remove it from its case.The cradle itself is really lightweight. It has four rubber feet that will keep it from sliding. It comes with a 5V micro USB cord. You can plug it into your computer USB port or a USB power adapter. The cradle can also be used to sync with your computer besides just for charging purposes.It has a very bright blue light up pencil/pen holder hole which is about the only negative comment I can say about this unit. I tried using it as a charger next to my nightstand but the bright blue lights surrounding the pencil/pen holder were just too bright and lit up the room at night. It would have been nice to have and on/off switch for the lights. I am using it at my office which is a perfect place because I am able to see incoming texts and calls because my iPhone 5 is on mute during office hours and use to lay flat on my desk, even when charging. Now I can have it charging and sitting straight up and not miss any important texts or phone calls from my family and friends. Now I can see it light up informing me when a call is coming in or an email or text has been received.I would of given it 5 stars but it loses one because of the bright blue light. I fixed the problem by putting a piece of black electrical tape over it.  Overall, I really like it.  My iPhone 5 slides easily in place, no connectivity issues and now I don't have to be constantly be checking my iPhone at work since it is looking straight at me!Sample provided for review purposes.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D1RR52K" id="B00D1RR52K-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-07:</strong> I use this charging station with my iPad mini in my office when I'm listing to my iHeartRadio app on it. I like to have talk news radio going throughout the day when I'm working and since my favorite radio station isn't local, I listen to it via my iPad mini using the radio application. What I like about this dock is it sits my iPad mini up on a stand, instead of it just laying down on my desk. It sits it up so I have a much better view of the screen and I can see navigate through my mini's menus easier.It charges my mini as well, so the battery doesn't drain all day while I'm listening to my station. Because of the location of the charging port on the mini, when it's plugged in for charging, the iPad mini sits vertically in the dock, not horizontally. There is a fun glowing spot on the back of the dock for holding my iPad's stylus, that lights up with the dock is plugged into a USB port to power it.The dock itself is done in both black and while colors, so it matches both black and while Apple products. There are four small rubber feet grips on the bottom of the dock, which helps keep it from sliding around on smooth surfaces. I think I like this dock better as an iPad mini dock than one for an iPhone, since it seems just the right size for the mini.A sample was provided for reviewing purposes.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D1RR52K" id="B00D1RR52K-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-08:</strong> Nothing fancy.

I had tried a similar Belkin dock and was disappointed that the lightning connection was too short to use with the phone in a case.  Unfortunately, the same is true with the VicTsing.  Even with a case with a wide cutout in the base, the lighting connection does not fully make contact with the port.  No contact, no charging.  The only case that worked for me was completely cut out in the bottom with not even a rim of plastic or silicone.  VicTsing, like Belkin, could solve the problem with a longer connection and, for bare iPhones, an adapter to raise them as though they were in a case.  Or they could otherwise allow the user to adjust the height.But on a bare iPhone 5, the dock works perfectly.  There is no support behind it, however, and the connection has free play, so my phone wiggled back and forth while I was trying to plug it in or disconnect it.  I suppose the semi-floating connection makes sure that the lightning connection doesn't snap off since there's is a gap behind the phone.The blue, lighted pen holder looks cool, although its function is questionable.  I'd rather have a lightning connection that didn't require me to remove my phone from its case every time I wanted to charge it.

When Apple decided to ditch their old connector design, a lot of cradles became instantly obsolete. From what I understand Apple is also very cagey about licensing their new connector design to the third-party developers, all of which has resulted in a very scarce market for third party products. And this is what makes this VicTsing Data Sync Charging Cradle so valuable. It's an inexpensive and well-designed cradle that is up to date with the latest technology. It sits very nicely on your work desk or a side table. It works with iPhone 5, iPad Mini, or the latest iPad. However, I've only tested it with my iPad Mini. I was able to sync all of the photos my iPad Mini to my MacBook Air quickly and straightforwardly. The cradle uses the micro USB cable to connect to a computer or an external charger. Unfortunately, the cradle doesn't come with the charger itself. This is not that much of a problem for me as I've accumulated plenty of chargers over the years, but a new user might want to have this option available. Furthermore, the cradle could be even more valuable if it is a charger in its own right, and if it also double as a power bank or an external battery then it would be a truly incredibly valuable gadget. Nonetheless, this is an elegant and solid product that would be very useful to any iOS device owner.The cradle also has a penholder that is surrounded by the blue LED power indicator light. This is a neat addition and makes the cradle particularly suitable for work environments. However, the power indicator light is VERY bright, and thus it makes this cradle unsuitable for a bedroom or other places that require ambient darkness.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D1RR52K" id="B00D1RR52K-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-28:</strong> I was provided a VicTsing Data Sync Charging Cradle/Docking Station for testing and review and was asked only to give my honest review, so this is what I found.Look: The VicTsing Docking Station is lightweight plastic docking station with a small footprint.  It is easily sturdy enough to hold up my iPhone 5 and looks to be sturdy enough to support the larger Apple iPads. It looks nice and has a nice build. It came in a pretty plain box with an USB Charging cable to plug into the back of it and no instructions (not that it really needed any).Use:  I plugged in my iPhone 5 into the docking station without a problem.  I was able to dock my phone without having to take off my Incipio Dual PRO case which was very convenient.  The phone had plenty of room to spare around it in the cradle (probably because it also can be used for larger iPads), so I was initially worried that it moved around too much.  I then realized that the Lightning Plug is mounted on a piece of plastic that is designed to move back and forth with a slight rocking motion.  This allowed for a little movement without worrying about breaking off the Lightning Plug or damaging your phone like you could with a docking station with a fixed plug.  This was a really nice feature.Performance: The big question when it comes to Apple Lightning Connectors on 3rd Party equipment is "Does it Work?"  In my initial testing, I can say that it definitely does.  I tested it using the standard Apple USB Wall Charging Block as well as a regular USB plug in my PC, and it both instances it charged perfectly.  When plugged into my PC, it also had no problem syncing with iTunes.  The charging speed was perfectly fine (about 1% per minute in my testing, which is normal) and the sync speed was the same as always.  I saw no slowdowns at all and everything worked as you would expect.Conclusion: Overall, this is a nice Apple Lightning Docking Station.  It passed the "Does it work?" test with flying colors despite my initial skepticism.  If you are looking for a docking station for your new Lightning generation Apple product, this looks to be a great choice.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D1RR52K" id="B00D1RR52K-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-13:</strong> good product for my phone after I figured out how to use it the customer service was okay but needs work</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D1RR52K" id="B00D1RR52K-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-02:</strong> I even bought a second one.

Just when you think everything is made in China.This is a good tool that a lot of thought has been put into. It feels good in your hand with its platic / rubber hand guard so the edges dont dig into your skin when you apply some pressure.Tool is flexable! Thats good because some times you have to really put the power into getting some things unstuck, so this tool will last and not be all bent up. It is made of spring steel so if it gets too wet and you dont dry it, it will rust some. Havent had that problem, its a just so you know.Works well on iPods and iPads and most any device where you must pry to get inside to fix screens and change out batteries. I do think that two of them might be helpful instead of using a place holder tool while you go around the endues to unlodge all the clip locks. Actually comes with good instructions that are helpful in its use and suggesting uses. When does that happen.This one is a keeper.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00792JJK4" id="B00792JJK4-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-06:</strong> Great tool.

True to their word, the tip does have any even thinner taper to it that makes wedging it between an iPad's back casing and the glass a fairly easy, but it felt thin and flimsy and I figured I could have just used a piece of stamped sheet metal from a local metal shop we have. However, after working with the iPad for several minutes, I found that there was one very big difference between this and just a plain piece of stamped metal, and that's the little padded grip. It seems like nothing when you first hold it, but that extra grip piece makes all the difference in being able to hold this tool fairly comfortably while applying leverage and pressure as you work. My hand still cramped after a bit (it was my first time opening an iPad, so it took me longer than the average YouTube instructional video), but it would have been horrible without that extra padding.The tool did bend a little more at the tip than I would have liked, but this tool is better suited for creating a gap so that you can then use some sort of plastic or nylon tool to apply additional leverage rather than using the iSesamo for all of your prying chores. Knowing what I know now, I look forward to using it more in the future, and I am very pleased with it overall. Definitely invaluable for working on an iPad while minimizing damage risk to the back casing or the plasic inner bezel/dust gasket.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00792JJK4" id="B00792JJK4-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-21:</strong> This is definitely a tool you need if you have a habit of working on iPods, iPads, etc. it is on the thin side, so there's a little give to it but, better a little give, than to break things with it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00792JJK4" id="B00792JJK4-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-26:</strong> The tool fits comfortably in my hand the handle is non slip.

I have a fetish for nice black leather, but the kickstand and reverse screen facing on the clip just got me thinking that this is the way to protect the gorgeous HD screen on my new phone.Wow, did I underestimate the description!  Solid rubberized material, tight fit to the clip portion (no losing the phone while in odd positions as my old case was known to do), and just overall put together like a luxury car.  With out a doubt the best case kit I have EVER owned.ADDED: After a year of abuse, I managed to break the stand and one of the clips.  It still worked, but was unstable and it was no longer secure in holding the phone.  Not indestructible, but for it's time it did very well.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006QYI6LO" id="B006QYI6LO-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-21:</strong> I love the case.

I bought this purely for a low profile (inherently has minimum protection) and cosmetics.  I like the black brushed aluminum on the back.  The biggest drawback for this case, is the plastic sides of the case, which makes it slippery to hold at times.  The back can normally be made of any materials, as most of the gripping are on the sides.  This falls short.  It'll get really slippery if your fingers get sweaty.  The gloss finish on the sides seem to show sweat more as well.  If you want a nice looking case to use for a formal occasion, this is a nice choice.  If you're looking for an everyday-use case, you will probably want to look for something more practical.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0055QRUUC" id="B0055QRUUC-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-06:</strong> I got a lot of compliments while I used this case because of the brushed aluminum look and minimalist design.

Did offer good protection also as it wasnt flimsy or cheap feeling.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0055QRUUC" id="B0055QRUUC-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-06:</strong> This case was pretty much as advertised, came quicker than promised and is good looking on my white iPhone 4S.  The only issue I have with it is that it does not extend beyond the front of the phone at all and therefore provides no protection to the front.  Also, the sides are quite slick which doesn't help to prevent dropping it.Update:  After two week of use, it has already cracked at a weak point along the top. I will be replacing it as soon as I can get a different case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0055QRUUC" id="B0055QRUUC-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-13:</strong> First of all, if you are looking for an extremely durable, protective case, this should probably not be your first choice. It is NOT an otterbox or something like that.Now, having said that, it is very solid. I had a CaseMate barely there black case before this, so I had an idea of what I was getting. This case is actually even more solid than my original barely there. It fits perfectly snug on my phone and all the cutouts match perfectly with the buttons. I have this on an iphone 4 from Verizon.I couldn't be happier with the look. It looks great. The case does wrap around each corner of the phone, so it will protect the corners from getting dinged. As others have mentioned however, the case sits almost flush with the screen, so there is NO protection for the screen if placed screen side down. I have a Zagg on mine, so I don't worry about it, but it might be a concern for some.Update:Well after only about a couple weeks, I started noticing that my phone was acting strange. It started to drop calls, lose signal, battery would drain quicker than normal, and reception in general was terrible. I could hardly talk to people because my calls were so choppy.At first, I didn't notice the problems started when I put this case on. Sadly it did take me two weeks to realize the coincidence of when the problems started. As soon as I realized this, I took the case off, and my phone has been back to normal. Really strange and not sure if others have experienced this. I can't imagine that a thin little piece of aluminum would cause that, but sure enough when I removed the case, my problems went away. Also, I did notice that my phone would get hotter with the case on. That was weird because my phone had never felt warm to the touch, but it did with the case on.Maybe I'm crazy, but this case really messed up my reception and battery life.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0055QRUUC" id="B0055QRUUC-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-08:</strong> Beautiful, great price, gives off a great idea of quality and style.

If you go to the Case-Mate website, you can easily compare all their cases, and see their description of this product. The case is made of plastic, and has a brushed aluminum insert on the back. It provides minimal protection, but looks great. I saw a friend's gun-metal brushed aluminum case, so I decided to buy the black brushed aluminum. It looks like part of the phone when installed. All the ports are easily accessed, and the case fits perfectly. The case does extend slightly above the edge of the front, so your screen will not touch the table if set down on it's face. If you want something that looks great, while providing minimal protection, this is the case for you. If you are more concerned about protection, you should look at different cases like the Case-Mate Tough Case, the Acase Superleggera PRO, or the Otterbox Defender. I have tried all four cases, and all are good choices depending on your needs.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0055QRUUC" id="B0055QRUUC-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-01:</strong> I really liked this case because of how unbelievably slim it was.  It was like the case wasn't even there, which is why it's 4 stars.  I am truly scared that even with the case that the phone will be damaged if dropped because of how slim the case is.There really isn't any extra protection, where as most other cases have rubber points or something to reflect damage.  This case simply absorbs it and because the case is so tight and small, all of that energy absorbed is still sent right through the phone.Overall this case is beautiful and if you trust it to protect the phone, it probably will. I was a bit skeptical and was scared to fully test it out but hopefully this helps your decision.Thanks!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B0055QRUUC', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B0055QRUUC', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00545WGDK</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00545WGDK</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

I didnt do any special battery conditioning, only what came on the instructions. After it died from the original charge, I left it charging over night for about 12 hours. I took the battery off of the charger at 2PM and it died at 10PM. Keep in mind I'm a very heavy user, but I never use 4G.

The back piece fits perfect and has a very similar feel to the original one. Its harder to remove than the original, but thats a good thing. Ill review this battery again in a month and I hope it keeps its charge.Also, 2 OEM batteries fit under this larger back so I can keep 3 batteries with me.PROS:-Lasted almost 3x as long as original-Phone still has a solid feel-Although fatter battery, it doesnt get in the way-Kick stand still worksCONS:-I cant think of any at the moment.CONCLUSION: THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ALL HTC EVO 4G OWNERS!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00545WGDK" id="B00545WGDK-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-30:</strong> This item works just as I thought it would.

The smaller ones can overheat and I've had problems with several (from different vendors) when charging dual devices.This charger has worked well for me, I've been able to charge both an iPhone 4s and an iPhone 5 at the same time without any problems.  We are very pleased with this charger.  We use it for iPhones, iPads and other USB powered devices (micro helicopters).  The charger stays firmly in the socket, there are dual contacts that seem to help keep it in place.If we want faster charging we can plug into the 2A side.

However, the thickness and proximity of the bottom edge of the case to the four controls buttons at the bottom of the screen makes the process of using these buttons rather frustrating. The problem is repeated when edit/control bottoms are rendered close to the bottom of the screen. Also, the proximity of the top flange of the case to the area of the notification bar which is at the top of the screen creates the same problem of not being able to manipulate the bar easily.THIS CASE NEEDS A RE-DESIGN TO ENSURE THE FUNCTIONALITY ADDS TO THE CURRENT NICE LOOK/FEEL OF THE CASE.My experience is in line with an earlier comment. Nice fit and feel to the case but poor design at the top and bottom of the case as these parts of the case interfere with the functionality of the touch screen.You may buy the case for its looks but controlling your device (when using the touch buttons at the bottom of the screen or notification bar on top of the screen) may be very frustrating! If you suffer from hypertension, avoid this!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003VQS3PE" id="B003VQS3PE-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-24:</strong> Solid case for a solid phone.

This set is the exact same thing as the Kinivo BTH220's I bought on Amazon.From my Kinivo BTH220 review:They are exactly what they are. Here's a quick review:Range: Good. I can walk around my apartment without losing signal. No wires.Build Quality: The speakers themselves seems good, but the band seems like it may be a bit flimsy.Audio Quality (music): Good. Face it, at this price point, you will not get anything amazing, but these get the job done with pretty good audio.Audio Quality (Calls): Decent. I hear people good and they hear me clearly too.Conclusion: This headset is does exactly what it it says it does and for pretty cheap. If you need a stereo headset while you are doing things around the house, or working out, these are great. I would not recommend driving with these on, they're not the best at blocking out sound, but still very good at it and it may be dangerous to drive with them on.If you would like something with better audio/quality in general, I would highly recommend the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 Bluetooth Headset. The audio (call and music) and build quality on that set is great. They are though, almost twice as expensive as this Kinivo set.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C7JIBN0" id="B00C7JIBN0-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-05:</strong> It works fine inside my house.

Any sudden movement or especially if I go as far as standing up it starts to skip. That means I can't lay in my bed and listen to music or watch a movie without bringing my laptop over.

The sound is truly impressive, and is much better than some of my headphones that have cost $100's +.  I have found they can actually amplify the sound higher than that of my original device which make them excellent for devices that never seem to put out the right volume, even at max volume.  Really good base reproduction too.  Truly fantastic.Pairing is simple and straightforward, had no issues in that department.  These are great to take on my afternoon jogs to enjoy music while I take in the scenery.  These work great with my phone for hands free calling in the house and office and even have support for VOIP applications.  I have paired them with my computer and use them for both skype and other chatting services.  I sound clear, my caller sounds clear, just the way it should be.The ear pieces have a good amount of padding, enough to keep them comfortable but not too much to make them bulky.  Just the right balance.Overall, I have found the Arctic P253BT Headphones to be solid performers and to deliver great results.[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C7JIBN0" id="B00C7JIBN0-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-24:</strong> Pairs easy with samsung galaxy 3 and tablet.

They sound pretty darn good, cost is really affordable. I have used them to make calls and have a conversation with on the phone also. Volume controls on the headset are a little rough to use as you go in blind with them on trying to adjust sound. Increasing the volume on the phone or iPod has little to no effect to the sound in the headphones. The multi function button on the right ear is easy to get to, but a little touchy when using for multi function. I've accidentally called someone back when trying to turn them off, or played a song when wanting to make a call because of the press and hold or press multiple times actions to launch a feature. Other then that, you can't go wrong for the price and quality. They don't feel cheap, but of course they don't feel high dollar either, it's the perfect balance and a little above what you would expect for the price. The head strap is not adjustable, so be careful here, it fits pretty good on the lower neck or back of head but it's kind of small. Big necks beware! The earphones are comfy with plenty of padding and they fit pretty nice on the ears and don't fall off or anything. Haven't tried jogging or anything like that, but I would see issues doing much bouncing with these on.Overall a good buy for the price point and sound quality.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C7JIBN0" id="B00C7JIBN0-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-01:</strong> I haven't taken it out jogging yet but I'm sure it'll be more comfortable than any of my cheap Sony in-ear headphones.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C7JIBN0" id="B00C7JIBN0-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-22:</strong> It connects well with my cell phone.

I find using the equalizer does help, but even out of the package, for the price, the sound is pretty good. No audiophile will accept the sound quality from these no matter what, but that's more to do with BT headphone capabilities than it is a reflection of the performance of these headphones.Bass is nice and deep, not too deep, and mids and highs seem to be fairly accurate.Pairing is very easy (hold down the power button until it flashes blue then red repeatedly, enable pairing on your device of choice and connect).The comfort level of these, thanks to them sitting around the back of your head, is very good. I wear glasses and have worn these for a few hours at a time just to try them out w/ glasses. No pain!The battery seems to last around 7-10 hours regularly, with regular use. I use these at a moderate level and at this level the power time seems to sit around 10 hours total. If you pump the volume all the way up, you will likely get less play time.In terms of how loud these get, I find the cups do a good job blocking ambient noise and keeping the sound in your ears. They aren't active noise canceling, but in public transit situations, they are adequate.Highly recommended.I received a free pair from the manufacturer for review purposes. I would pay my own money for these, as at this price the performance and sound quality are better than similar WIRED headphones I've used.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C7JIBN0" id="B00C7JIBN0-review28" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-12:</strong> As an audiophile I can tell that the sound quality of these headphones are comparable to much more expensive models. After downloading the proper software for my BT USB Adapter, I have nothing but listening pleasure. Connects to iphone like wet to water, connects to tablet the same. If you don't want to spend a lot for quality sound this headset should do the trick for you. As far as comfort, the smaller your head the better, still they work for me just fine...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C7JIBN0" id="B00C7JIBN0-review29" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-23:</strong> I have had 3 different versions of this headset over the years and they all are great until they fail.  I wear these when I work out, and so they get very sweaty over time and are subjected to quite a bit of abuse.  Even so, the headsets last about a year or two and sound great the entire time.  The failure is usually the connector where the headset charges.  Once it gets a little sweat on it, it seems to self destruct.  This is one time that a cheep plastic part will outperform the expensive metal ones!I generally connect my iPod and phone both at the same time and listen to music on treadmill.  When a call comes in, I can hear it because the music automatically cuts out and I hear the ringing.I keep buying these because they are comfortable and they sound good.  The Bluetooth works well.  I have purchased lower cost headsets and the Bluetooth does not connect well or looses the connection from time to time.  Not good.  These do not have that problem at all.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00C7JIBN0', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00C7JIBN0', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B008CQT1H2</h2>    <p class="price"> $B008CQT1H2</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

It has a nice silky rubber feel; and doesn't pick up much dust/lint when you set it down. Very easy to put on-and to take off. This is a good thing!  I hate struggling to get a phone case on or off!  Looks-black on my white phone looks awesome.  Some reviewers have said that it is 'baggy' on the side. Yes, it is; but not enough so it comes off or anything! Just a bit of give on one side of mine.  Has just enough of a 'lip' on the front of the phone to set it down face first! The grid of squares on the back is nice looking. So overall; this get 4 stars. If you want a case that doesn't take a hammer to get it off; looks nice, and you don't drop your phone; this one is it!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008ZZY9C2" id="B008ZZY9C2-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-24:</strong> I received this case and it was not exactly what I had expected.  Within 48 hours of putting it to use on my iPhone, the Snugg name started coming off.  I contacted Amazon and they made it right.  Since the name coming off was only cosmetic, I kept the case and it is doing well.  Snugg then contacted me directly regarding this review and sent me a replacement case without charge.  The replacement case has held up cosmetically after a week of very intensive testing and I am now very happy with the case, both in its function and cosmetic retention.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008ZZY9C2" id="B008ZZY9C2-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-08:</strong> It's a great silicon case.

The very clear owner's manual explains that its best to keep the iPhone attached full time with the on-off switched "on" all the time.  Anyway, I followed the directions and bingo, in the morning the backup was fully charged as well as the iPhone itself. I'll keep track as the time goes by and update my review as necessary.  I sure hope it works as marketed since the quality is first rate and for the low price it appears you get more than your money's worth.  I've had a MOPHIE backup which came with the iPhone 4 three years ago and thought an additional helper battery would be smart. I'm a legal consultant and the iPhone must work all the time...no excuses!...Here's hoping.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005WQRMWG" id="B005WQRMWG-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-23:</strong> charged my iphone 4s 20 percent with the case fuly charged.. then didnt charge at all after a week so yeah its junk</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005WQRMWG" id="B005WQRMWG-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-19:</strong> I got mine and it's exactly what to expect when you're paying less that $10 bucks.  Though it says it's 1900 mah, it would charge the phone to full.  I read that it should be surprising since the phone requires more juice than just 1470 mahs.  Anyways, I've charged my iPhone 4 from 12% percent.  After a while, hour or so, it only charged my phone between 57% to 77%.  I think, when I turned my phone off, I manage to get it to 87%.I got the white case and had to get a black marker to blacken the camera area cause the photos with flash had a white blur in them.  It worked.It gets really hot when I'm charging the case and phone at the same time.  Especially when I'm using the phone during the recharging.  I would suggest you charge the case first and then the phone.  Obviously, you should know that heat breaks down the battery's capabilities in holding the charge.  So please don't just charge it and ignore it.  You didn't pay enough to garner that kind of technology that automatically turn off itself.I don't like that screen of the phone is a bit out of the case.  Do NOT lay your phone facing down then.  There is no space between the screen and the case like others.As long as it keeps chugging, I'm happy with my purchase with all of it's blemishes.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005WQRMWG" id="B005WQRMWG-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-25:</strong> At first I thought it didn't work, but after a while I got the Knicks and knacks of it!

My iPhone constantly falls out of the holster.  It wasn't so bad at first, but now that it's colder outside, I have to wear a coat.  If you wear a coat, it will constantly grab onto the rubberized coating and pop the phone out of the holster and onto the ground.I'm sure that a simple modification could make this a five star case, but until then, it's a FAIL.

That being said, I was pleasantly surprsied when I recieved this case in the mail. I read all the reviews and was a little weary but just wanted a case with a kick stand so I went for it!It has a nice material, doesn't feel too durable though so I wouldn't feel to confident about dropping it or bumping into hard objects if you don't want any scratches or chipping of paint.If you simply want a case that allows you to stand your phone upright on a flat surface then just spend the $3!It also comes with a nice holster case with a clip that you can attach to your belt loop or purse strap or what have you. The holster case can slide on the cover of the phone for front protection or over the back of the case itself if you still wish to have your screen showing while it is clipped to something.There's not much complaining that can be done about this case because it serves its purpose for a very reasonable price. Although it has not been a full day so if the quality changes over time i will update my review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004VN09LM" id="B004VN09LM-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-20:</strong> I loved this type of case on my Droid Charge, and I love it just as much on my iPhone 4.

I do not like a case that entirely covers the device all around detracting from the iPhones natural beauty and makes it more bulky than it needs to be.

So it can take as much as two or more weeks to arrive. However, the customer service is ironically really responsive.Durability....its okay. The first one I got the stand on the case broke and the side where the volume is broke. Emailed customer service and right away shipped out another one...which got here two weeks later. Remember its coming from Singapore.The second one I recieved...well the belt clip stand broke. Luckly I had the other one from the first order.Over all when its not broken and you dont mind the two weeks delay, its pretty good deal for the price.

The kickstand did work nicely while it was still on the case.Gripwise it was good. Just enough so that it wouldn't slip out of my hand but not too much so it wouldn't slide out of your pocket.Overall the case itself provides minor protection. It is essentially a hard plastic covering. No added corner proection, ect.I recently purchasedZeroChroma Black Teatro-S Case for iPhone 4and it is definitely an upgrade. The kickstand is much sturdier, but overall it also provides little protection for a major fall. I would recommend the zerochroma over this one, but it is also a lot more expensive.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004VN09LM" id="B004VN09LM-review29" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-21:</strong> I ordered this case/holster for my son because he had spoken about it.

A coworker of mine bought this exact case from the store and paid $43 dollars for it. I found it here on Amazon and thought that it was going to be a cheap knock off - I was surprised to find that it is the exact same case, but it comes directly from China and not in the box or retail packaging. The case is great, it has a solid build and a rubberized texture to it. The case snaps on securely to the phone, and the phone in the case fits snugly into the holster. The clip on the holster is solid and rotates to your linking. The case and the holster also have a "kickstand" each for placing your phone in a position to watch videos / movies. The finish feels durable, and the case still allows for easy access to the buttons / controls. The only thing that someone who drops phones  a lot would not like is that there is no protection along the top and bottom edges, the case grips the phone on each side. If the phone falls and lands along the top or bottom edges, there could be damage. I think that this case rocks though, and at more than $35 cheaper than in the store it can't be beat.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004VN09LM" id="B004VN09LM-review31" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-21:</strong> This case works great.

HOWEVER..... when i recieved them they were terrible cases with very poor design. the otter box fell short in the fact that the shell does not snap together tightly and causes the iphone4 to shift inside. also the rubber silicone exterior would beome loose and contantly fall off its clips. the only thing good about the otter box was the holster. this also goes for the ballistic case with terrible holster. the survivor is a good case and loved it at first i liked it because the shell snapped around the iphone tightly and the otter silicone would not sag or come off unless you physically pulled it off. HOWEVER..... the big issues with this case are 1. the camera flap is too tightly secure 2. the silent mute button is damn near impossible to get to especially if you have bigger fingers 3. THE BELT CLIP SUCKS!!! downright SUCKS!!! 4. HEAVY and BULKY! it is not at all practical to carry in your pocket due to the chance of your pants falling down.NOW FOR THIS CASE REVIEW: all i have to say is WOW! awesome indeed it is. love the fact that it has all the features that i was looking for but in a very compact size. first off you have the holster. i always wear my iphone4 on my belt and very rarely put in in my pants pocket. slides in and out without any trouble but secure enough so it don't fall out when not intended to use. secondly the shell that incases the iphone4 is amazingly secure and fits like a glove. love how it feels in my hands and is very grippy. i dont feel like its going to fall out of my hands when in use. i also use a screen protector made by powersupport and its an antiglare film to minimize anoying glare when out and about. the case snaps on and donesn't interfere with the screen protector at all even when using the holster.so go buy a powersupport screen protector at your local Apple store or from powersupport.com. lastly the kickstand is the best feature. this baby is easy to slide and clips into place very snuggly and then retracts when finished. love the fact that it has the same design and pattern as the rest of the case for a stealth appearence.CONS: only con for me is that i wish i found out about this case a long time ago. i accidently bumped into this case at my local sprint store because i didn't care for the previous case i bought(spent $30.00) and could only exchange the item for another case. put this baby on and loved it ever since. i dont know who makes this case (not a name brand) but the manufacturer definatley hit the design and durability of this case on the nose. also i read alot of owner complain about it not having top and bottom protection. i dont find this a huge problem. yes it does have minimal protection on the top and bottom but if your careful and not clumsy with the iphone and place it back in its holster where it was inteneded to be placed when not in use its not going to be a big deal. i bought the iphone in white and love its design and this case helps preserve it beauty as it was inteneded to be. thank you</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004VN09LM" id="B004VN09LM-review33" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-09:</strong> The stand on the back of this case is cool.

I was looking for a belt clip holder for those times when it isn't possible to put my phone in my pocket or I needed quick access to my phone.  I'm not sure how durable this will be since I've only owned this for a couple of weeks but the design that allows the case to turn into a stand is great.  I will say that when the pnone is holstered it is more difficult to get out of the belt clip than I would like, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.  That could be a positive for some since I know it won't fall out accidentally.  Overall I am pleased and for the times I want a belt clip or want to stand the phone up to view something this is a nice product...especially for less than 10 dollars!!!

It's slick enough to slide easily into a pocket, but it's not slippery.The top and bottom of the iPhone is fully exposed, allowing any non-cradle charger to be used.  Many cases do not have a large enough opening on the bottom to allow use of third party chargers.The side is open for the volume and mute controls, and the camera/flash opening is ample.The kick stand is simple and functional design.  Well done!The one issue I have is with the front edges.  If you do not use a screen protector, there is no issue.  Most people I know use one, and the issue is that the front edges of the case essentially meet the edges of the screen protector.  The result is that it is very hard NOT to loosen or damage the screen protector when installing this case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004VN09LM" id="B004VN09LM-review59" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-30:</strong> Other reviews state it breaks easy.

After shipping this came to less tan $ 9.00.  It was in my hands 2 days after placing the order.  This is the exact same case that the Verizon store sells for $30 plus tax.  I would buy it for $30  if I didn't find it here for $8 and change.  I don't like cases on my phones - whether it is a Blackberry or Iphone, if it is a nice phone I prefer to go commando...but if you are going to get a case for your Iphone get this one.  First of all I won't tell you that you will get total protection because but the fact is it really only protects the back and sides and if you want a case the protects everything then your phone is going to be so wrapped up in a case it will look and feel nothing like the phone you paid good money for because you like everything about it including the feel.  I think the way it is designed if you drop it the weighting will make it likely fall on the back or side anyway.  This puts a little weight and bulk on your Iphone but not much at all - you still know you have an Iphone.  A feature which I LOVE is the kickstand which comes right out then slides back in.  I leave it standing on my desk in work all day and if I need to look at for any reason (email, website, photo, video, etc) it is standing right up - no need to pick up the phone.  Same with just sitting on the porch listening to music - kickstand up, speakerphone on, music playing, cold beer in my hands, and my dog (or wife) in the other rocking chair -  the kickstand alone is a selling point for me on the case and it lets you rest your phone either vertically or horizontally.  Also the protection in the sides leaves one huge opening for the volume and mute buttons so they are simple to get to (as the unprotected top makes it simple to get to the headphone jack and on/off button).  Perfect size opening in the back for the camera. The hard plastic has a great feel (not like those rubbery cases)and the pattern on the plastic is nice - its not just a plain black plastic case. Finally there is the belt clip - I don't really use it much because the bottom line is larger phones like the Iphone are big for a belt clip - but this was does rotate so you can turn it sideways if you want to - my friend has the same case and he tells me he uses the belt clip at work all the time (it slides in and out real easy when you face the phone to in the inside of the clip as directed  but the phone is facing inside the clip so you only see the back of the phone from the outside....not sure why?) .If ever there was NOT a "You get what you paid for" item this is it - granted you don't get the fancy Verizon packaging and it just comes in a plastic sealed bag, but the second you take it out of the bag it is the $30 case from Verizon which is worth even what Verizon charges.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004VN09LM" id="B004VN09LM-review61" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-10:</strong> my friend have one look just exactly same from the picture but much expensive (he got $25+tax), when i saw this from amazon right away i order 3 for myself and friends, well.. the quality is quite the same but you paid what you got.. and actually for this price and no shipping charge, i have to say it's pretty good deal tho...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004VN09LM" id="B004VN09LM-review62" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-12:</strong> This is a very handy design.

I had dropped by phone on the asphalt and it unfortunately dropped and made a prominent nick on the bottom corner of the phone.  So, the protection can be improved, but for the price, it's still a good case.--------------------- Original review below ------------------------I ordered several cases for iPhone 4S for our 4 iPhones.  Out of all of these, I like this one the best.  It was actually the least expensive of them all.Pros:1. Wonderfully tight, but not "damage your iphone"-tight, fit.2. The external surfaces of the case is slightly rubbery plastic that feels just right.  Nice grip, if not a bit slippery.3. you can fit your iPhone 4, or 4S in many different orientations.  I can have it facing up or down, glass side up or glass side down.4. The encased iPhone slides out of the holster easily, but it is securely held by the holster at the same time.5. Camera hole is nice and wide. It will not cause flash-reflection artifacts when the picture is taken with flash.6. The mic/speaker holes are well exposed.  Some cases muffles the rings because the speaker is covered, but this doesn't have that problem.7. Craftsmanship is surprisingly good for a product that's $8 shipped.  Amazing.Cons:1. The charging port is covered.  But actually, you can reverse the way encased iPhone goes into the holster and then you can charge it without taking the phone out of the holster.  So, there's actually no cons here.BTW, if it matters at all, I bought it from Niceeshop.  They actually ship it from the oversea via USPS first class mail.  It took about two weeks to arrive.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004VN09LM" id="B004VN09LM-review65" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-04:</strong> Very protective and the kick stand is a nice addition.

I have been using the flip cover case for my S2, S3 and S4s through the years and NOT had an damage to any of the phones ... although I have dropped them on more than one occasion.  I normally get the cheapest possible, which still look good and last and of course protect the phones.  The ones I usually buy are not available so I went up the scale and was pleasantly surprised.  Very high quality.  A nice touch ... there was an insert that reminded me to put my credit in, if I carry one in my phone case, with the stripe next to the phone, instead of on the side away from the phone so the magnet would not wipe out the information and render my card ... useless.  Nice touch.  Materials are high quality and much nicer than any I saw in Kiosks in a couple of malls, and much cheaper than the provider.  So, before even getting home, I used the phone to order two of these from Amazon and had them the next morning.  Awesome.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IIWKQX8" id="B00IIWKQX8-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-08:</strong> Nice case.....only problem is it holds onto the phone soooo well, that to re-boot the phone (which requires pulling the battery out from time to time), I'm afraid of breaking the case that holds it.

I will use this case for when I just want to carry my license and a credit card. The case looks and feels very premium. I could not tell this is not real leather. The plastic that the phone snaps onto is very high quality as well and has a great semi-rubbery feel. Overall the profile of the case is still pretty thin.

Some cases are too stiff to hold the phone to your ear comfortably. Also, stays in the case VERY well, as a matter of fact, it is extremely hard to get out of the case when I want to switch cases. Still looks nice after a month of use. Would buy it in another color too.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IIWKQX8" id="B00IIWKQX8-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-07:</strong> Spigen is one of my favorite case makers. There's alot of value choices available on ebay, but Spigen has always been consistent and synonymous with quality. This case is no different. The case is precise and snug, there isn't variances as you usually get with the cheap $5 cases.Sure you can argue that this costs more, but I'm certain it will last while proving to be durable. The wallet adds minimal bulk to the phone and is a nice understated color. I don't want bright pink and lime green leathers or multiple colors intermingling. This says and looks &#34;professional.&#34;</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00IIWKQX8', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00IIWKQX8', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B005MKERVQ</h2>    <p class="price"> $B005MKERVQ</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

I enjoy the flexibility of having one mobile device to provide internet to any of my other devices. Where I live the t-mobile HSPA+ network does give 4G equivalent speed as promised. Battery life gives me 6 to 8 hours of mixed use. Also since the device runs on its own juice it doesn't further tax the battery power of any of my devices.Like all mobile broadband devices, this isn't a good choice for very heavy data usage like Netflix or large file downloading, but is more than adequate for most everything else.Make sure to check T-Mobile's coverage in your area, but overall great choice and flexibility and fairly reasonable rates 35 dollars for 3.5GBs w/o a contract.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005MKERVQ" id="B005MKERVQ-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-13:</strong> Loves these, I do wish it had LTE but it lets you do more than almost any other hotspot.

I've spent more than an hour on the phone trying to deal with the horrid customer service on different issues, and am now stymied because I can see the field where I should enter the required temporary password that came in the above text message, but I am somehow unable to type anything in that field, despite trying on an iPad and two different Android devices from different manufacturers.  The customer service phone number given in the manual does NOT connect you to the right people, and after slogging through an automated voice recognition system, you are connected to an operator who will connect you to the 4G phone service people, who will then tell you that they do not do hotspots, and send you to another person, who will then transfer you to yet another person, and eventually I find myself on hold long enough that I hang up and start over.  Before each transfer, the CSRs (who very obviously do not have English as their first language) read a lengthy script telling you that they are not the ones to solve your problem and another department does it, but they will transfer you to another department who will immediately solve my problem because my problem is so important to them, and T-Mobile is committed....blah, blah.  Before I abandoned my attempt (after over an hour, most of which was either on hold or listening to CSRs read soothing scripts that had nothing to do with solving my problem, I was interrupting the last CSR as he began his "I'm going to transfer you...." and asking, "Just transfer me!" and he would begin reading the script again from the beginning each time.  He did not understand what I was asking, and I'm sure he thought I was being a total jerk. After I spent a lengthy period of time on hold, I hung up.  I'm going to cool off for 24 hours, and give one more Boy Scout try at solving my problem.  If I don't succeed quickly, this will go back to Amazon.  From what I've read, it sounds like it will be a nice device if I can just break through the activation process and the ineffective system of customer service.  (Check my other reviews and you will see that I am rarely if ever this critical).I'm sure I've had a worse customer service experience sometime in my life, but I can't remember it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005MKERVQ" id="B005MKERVQ-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-25:</strong> This T-Mobile hotspot is a lifesaver for those trips where hotels charge an arm and a leg for wifi.

I have used Virgin Mobile and they keep changing their pricing on the Prepay and had a lot of no service because of Virgin Mobile says their up grading their net work. They never gave me any type of credit or extra time. So far I am very happy with T-Mobile and I receive faster service and more reliable connection for the same price. I love being able to use it as a flash drive. I didn't have any trouble activating it or connecting it to my Lap Top. I did have to buy a new sim card. I did have it activated at a local T-Mobile Store (Brick and Mortar).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005MKERVQ" id="B005MKERVQ-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-03:</strong> I bought this because my internet keeps going out in the middle of the night, whether I'm on the phone (I have an internet home phone), watching a YouTube video, or even playing an online game.  I waited for the right time on this device, my local Wal-Mart brought the price down by $15.My choices were T-Mobile, Verizon Wireless, Virgin Mobile, or some unknown MVNO that (like Virgin Mobile) uses Sprint towers.  Verizon is the most expensive ($100 device, $60 for 3 gb's, but had best coverage).  Virgin Mobile was close at $90 for the device, with about $30 to $40 a month, but uses WiMax for 4G.  The unknown MVNO cost $75 for the device I believe, and it only receives 3G.  T-Mobile's hotspot cost me $70 with the sale.PlansT-Mobile just released a new plan called Pay In Advance.  It is the same plan as what you could get under their monthly service, except it's now prepaid (you'll need to have a debit card on file, auto renew is a must).  $20 gets 500mb's of up to 4g speeds, anything after that is throttled to 2G.  You can go up to 12.5 gb's of 4G for $80.  When I activated my hotspot, I paid for the $50 5gb plan, which lasts 2 months since Walmart devices were eligible.Speed/CoverageThis device doesn't have LTE.  It uses HSPA+, which I can't complain about.  I live in a rural city and At&t;, T-Mobile & Verizon are the only ones who offer 4g out here.  I get anywhere between 4&8 Mbps down and about 1mbps up on T-Mobile's HSPA+For the most part, I get coverage just about everywhere I go.  Some are as I go to don't even have 3G yet, but it's only a small hit when I go through those places since I go right back into coverage down the road.DeviceThe device is so small that it resembles a compact cell phone, which makes it great for storing in your pocket and forgetting about it.  It does get a little warm, but like another reviewer mentioned, not scorching hot.  I haven't used this device enough to determine battery life, but using it for about an hour or so inside of a building used 1 battery bar out of 4.InternetI am able to get most places without any wait times.  Only one website I went to didn't work on this device, but worked on my home internet.  The ping is usually around 80-ms ping, so I was curious to see if I could play games online.  I played Halo 4 and it didn't lag on me at all.  It did use approximately 90mb's for a 10 minute game though.Overall I'm happy with it and I may even change to an unlimited 2g plan with more than 500mb's of 4g.12/24/2013I've had this device for about 3 months.  While I have no problem with this device itself, as it still works just fine, I now have a problem with T-Mobile.  After learning about the new auto-renew plans for pre-paid, I signed for the 500mb a month plan.  On 12/18, about 2 weeks into my plan, I receive an email from T-Mobile stating my auto-enroll had been cancelled.  I contacted them via email, they confused my hotspot for a mobile phone at first, but then later realized it and told me they'd send it upwards to the proper team.  Its been 6 days since that first email and I've heard nothing.  As of the last 2 days in a row, I am unable to sign up for any plan, as nothing shows up under available monthly plans.  I'd hate to pay for another mobile hotspot as these devices aren't cheap.  I paid $70 for this device, AT&T; & Verizon's are $100 a piece.  That means once my data is up, I have no more internet to go on.  I hate relying on public WiFi since I've had terrible experiences with them not working at all, or not working well.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005MKERVQ" id="B005MKERVQ-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-25:</strong> I bought this item with the intentions of using my already paid for plan.

It works great. It's speedy and I love the portability -- I also use it on the bus to work. I use it with my iPhone, iPad and Kindle.The reason I didn't give it five stars is it was a pain to set up, but a call to T-Mobile customer service helped a lot.I don't know why some people are saying you need a contract with this device -- I'm currently signed with a 30-day 1 gb pass. In my opinion, it's a great deal, although I do find myself burning through data quickly.

Finally decided to try a hotspot since I can get 4G at the back of my house.  I bought this here at amazon from Below Market Cellular.  It was supposed to be new, but it wasn't (had to remove someone else's emails).  Nevertheless, I kept it because it works.  After reading reviews here, I took it into a t-mobile store to activate and ensure that it would work.  Moved it around the house to find the best signal, and used a wifi extender to get signal to my office.  All is working as it should. Ping is under 100 and download is usually 4.5MPS. Need the max of 12G/mo which runs $80 plus tax. Added it as another line to my tmobile account.  To control data usage, I've deleted automatic program updates (i.e., windows) and changed to notifications.  Then I can use the pokey DSL and let it chug away overnight. I usually end up with a little bit of data to spare at the end of the month so then I watch all the videos and youtube clips that friends have sent that month. I'm glad to have this (sure miss city life) and recommend it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B005MKERVQ', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B005MKERVQ', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00EZD91YO</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00EZD91YO</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

I bought one for the Note 2 last year. The Note 2 belongs to my girlfriend now and she still uses the Cimo case.I ordered one for the Note 3. Here's what I like about it.1. The textured sides improve grip.2. The case just looks nice.3. It fits snugly.4. With the case on, the camera bump on the phone doesn't touch the desk, so it won't get scratched or scuffed.5. Can lay the phone face down without the screen touching the table.6. All the cutouts (infrared, 3.5mm headphone jack, speaker grill, charging port, S-Pen, microphone) are all properly done.7. Volume and Power buttons are covered but easy to press.What I didn't like.1. Got a little warped in shipping (it was cold out). It still fit snugly, but the sides are bowed out a little bit (I can squeeze the case on the sides and there's a little give there where the sides don't touch the inside of the case). It isn't enough to remove a star or even be negative, but something I wanted to mention.I would highly recommend this case to anyone getting any of the Galaxy phones they support. They're sturdy, reliable, and they work well. I couldn't ask for more in a case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EZD91YO" id="B00EZD91YO-review23" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-23:</strong> good</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EZD91YO" id="B00EZD91YO-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-28:</strong> the grips on this case are so amazing. i  can hold my phone with one hand with the confidence that it wont slip of of my hand. the back isnt slippery whatsoever and it adds almost no bulk or weight to the phone. love this case. my daily driver so far.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EZD91YO" id="B00EZD91YO-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-02:</strong> I like this alot, stylish and provides grip.

Also, the color isn't the off-white like the phone, but rather has a bit of blue/green tone so it doesn't look as nice with a white phone.

The camera could be recessed a few millimeters more - it is deceptively slim in that there is a tiny lip protecting the camera... but i would have felt more at ease if it was more noticeably protected, but that's just a piece of mind thing...

The "buttons" aren't raised enough to feel very well, but they're smooth surrounded by the textured "grippy" so all's not lost in that regard, but it's not as easy as other TPU cases I've purchased. My gripe is the fit.  It's either too short on the back-side or too long on the front side so that some of the silver frame shows on the top & bottom (landscape from the front).  I can see where the Note2 rounder design would be a better fit; the sides are fine just because they're longer.  (pics included)Edit: After a couple of removals, it's stretching, which makes it gap a lot, definitely more than the pics show.  I've used it for about a week total.  It's not behaving at all like other TPU cases I own, which are fine.Second edit:  after having chewed through a few more cases, it seems like all of them gap around this particularly rectangular phone.  I use a bumper, now, that overlaps onto the screen some,  I  love that this one has the BEST grippy sides I've ever used on a case (might even work for exfoliating nasty feet in a pinch; it feels like my dad's old wood shop rasp.)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EZD91YO" id="B00EZD91YO-review34" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-09:</strong> I got a clear case for my Note 3.

Boy I'm happy!This is in essence the same Griffin model made for the 30 pin connector but with a lightning end and more amps to better fit the iPhone 5 charging needs, same coiled cable, same plug. I had one of those to charge my iPhone 4 and loved it, gave me many years of service, so for me this was a natural upgrade. I particularly like coiled cables, it avoids having a very long cable wrapping around anything on the front of the car, while giving you the flexibility to move far from the plug. I tried it and I got to the back seats of the car with the connector still holding on the iPhone. The coil is still a bit strong but it's new, with time it will get easier I'm sure, as it did with the previous oneBuilt quality is good, cable is strong and the connector fits the iPhone as if it were Apple's original. The bulb is made of hard plastic -as expected and as almost all car chargers around- and it fits very nice and tight on my Prius aux plug. The cable is part of the unit, meaning there is no USB connector to separate the cable from the bulb. This is good for me as I don't have to deal with misplaced cables or disconnections while the coil is stretched, but for some people it might be an issue.  It also helps to keep the bulb very small and with a very low profile when plugged into the carHaven't measured charging time or compared them with the specs, but it fully charged a 25% charged iPhone 5 in a less than an hour, which in my opinion it's very good for a car charger.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002VZSQ08" id="B002VZSQ08-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-30:</strong> Works very well to charge my phone, haven't had problems yet, will update if something happens other than regular use.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002VZSQ08" id="B002VZSQ08-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-04-14:</strong> Had it a few months, no problems - lights up blue looks awesome.

While it says this is for the Droid A855, it works with any micro-USB device.Personally, I've used it with theNokia N900,BlackBerry 9700, Nexus One,Kindle 3G, and MyTouch 3G Slide. It's moved from car to car, person to person, and doesn't show any signs of the plastic weakening or the connector bending.The only real drawback this charger has is the glowing blue Motorola logo. If your 12V adapter isn't switched, it's going to glow blue the whole time it's plugged in, and could draw some unwanted attention to your car in a parking lot. The logo is also a bit wide, so if space around your outlet is at a premium, it might take some wiggling to get this to fit right.Really though, for what this costs, you're getting an outstanding quality product. Most of the knockoffs in this range use ultra thin plastic, and don't hold up well. This is definitely a step up, and would easily cost five times as much in an AT&T; / Sprint / T-Mobile / Verizon store.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002VZSQ08" id="B002VZSQ08-review22" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-29:</strong> Had it for a couple weeks before it stopped working under normal wear.

They are always a varying level of quality or features.  Some times even the OEM charges are not designed or built well.  Fuses blow, cords permanently stretch, ends get gunked up with things from the car, etc...For the first time I can say that this is a truly great car charger.  It simply does exactly what it is supposed to do, does it quickly and then also seems to be built like a tank.  The coils have just the right amount of tension and the connector fits snugly.  And then, there's the light.  Unlike many chargers with a little LED, this features a white light ring that comes on when the charger is plugged in.  It sheds just the right amount of light in the car to help you see things at night, without being distracting - although I am sure that depends on where your socket is located.If you are in the market for a car charger, this one rocks!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002VZSQ08" id="B002VZSQ08-review30" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-19:</strong> Original review below.  After a year, this charger went belly-up.  Although the connection to the lighter still lit up and it looked like it was active, it did not charge my phone.  Was disappointed, but thought it lasted a year and I'd have to just get another.  On the first use of the new PowerJolt, I noticed intermittent phone charging.  When I unplugged the cable, the connector separated from the cable and remained in the phone.  I've had several Griffin products over the years and have always been satisfied with the quality.  Something has changed in their quality control.  Sending it back to Amazon and will avoid Griffin products in the future.========================================Bought a Griffin for my iphone-4, and when I upgraded to a 5, I bought this charger.  I've had it for about 3 months now, and it works without issue.  Much better quality than other brands I've used.

Anyway, the Gripgo is on the windshield and the plug goes from the lower center console on my Subaru to the windshield. Some reviews stated the plug is too tight and does not expand enough. I do not find this to be the case. The plug easily reaches the 10-12 inches I need and I can expand it further as well without it pulling too much. If I stretch it out far then I can see it being an issue, but unless you're trying to reach the backseat of the car with this who cares?I do agree with those who complained about the bright white LED light on the plug itself. It is bright, but I do not find it distracting at all. However I can see it being distracting if it were higher on my console. As such Griffin should consider changing this to blue or make it a small pinhead light instead.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B002VZSQ08', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B002VZSQ08', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00BIV04D8</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00BIV04D8</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

I was a bit concerned at the beginning because I read on another comment that the rubber part was flimsy and di not fit well around the phone. I separated the hard shell from the rubber and was very thin and flimsy. I placed the phone in the rubber cover and was a bit loose. However, once I put the hard case in place, everything fell into place nicely, and the rubber part took shape. I am very happy with it overall. The charging port is open enough to plug the phone to the charger. The only time I have to remove the hard case is when I connect the phone to a flat screen via HDMI because the cable cannot be connected with it. Other than that, I recommend it. It looks very nice and elegant and allows people to see the BB logo on the back of the phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BIV04D8" id="B00BIV04D8-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-10:</strong> Doing the job</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BIV04D8" id="B00BIV04D8-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-10:</strong> The case is easy to put on, but the cutouts for controls and especially charging port NOT lining up exactly.

Nice. The case LOOKS stellar.My only complaint is the main reason I bought the case.  The phone is too slippery without a case - you simply HAVE to have a case for this phone or it WILL eventually slip from your hands.  This case adds a little bit of tackiness to help keep it from slipping, but the back is too hard and smooth, and it will still slide around on a smooth surface.  This is a problem if you need to set it on the dash as you drive, or place it on the arm of an easy chair for example.  It really needs a more "rubberized" or tacky finish all around.I'll try this a little longer, but I may end up going with a more conventional silicone case, which will probably absorb falls a bit better, too.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003ZHV6D0" id="B003ZHV6D0-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-12-02:</strong> This was the first case I bought for my Evo.  Having TPU around the edges is better than silicone in my opinion because it TPU does not attract lint.  Having a clear back was nice too, because it preserved the original looks of the phone.But...This case is difficult to put on and even harder to take off.  In fact, the TPU surround tore away from the clear back as I was attempting to remove the case.  Removing the case was a struggle because it fits tightly (fitting tightly is not a bad thing though).  The TPU is clearly not adhered well enough.I was also not satisfied that the camera was protected.  When in this case, the camera lens is flush with the clear back, meaning the lens would still be resting on the table if I set the phone down with the phone's back facing the table.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003ZHV6D0" id="B003ZHV6D0-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-10-08:</strong> This case is perfect.  It's exactly what I need.  So I'm very frustrated that it just fell apart.I got it at the beginning of October.  It's December 16th, and the black sides of the case just came free of the clear back.  I'd understand this if I'd abused the phone and the case, but it spends most of the day sitting on a desk.  To carry it with me I slip it into a cargo pocket.  There's nothing else in that pocket, since I don't want to damage the screen.  There are a few scuff marks on the back of the case, but very little wear.  I never removed the phone from the case and it fit well right up to the moment when it fell apart.Everything I wrote in the previous review is true: the case is slim, it fits well, it doesn't change the look of the phone, buttons are easy to push through the case.  It's really the perfect case for me.  But I do need it to last more than 10 weeks.I'm moving on to aSeidio Innocase. Too bad.Old (October) review:I was a little nervous about buying this case since it had no reviews, but thought I'd give it a try.  So far I'm glad I did.I haven't dropped the phone (yet,) so if (when) I do, I'll update the review then.  These are initial impressions.The case didn't really change the look of my phone at all.  It's got a slightly raised lip around the screen, so when I put the phone down face-down, the screen doesn't come into contact with the table at all.  The sides seem thick enough to protect against normal abuse.  The back is clear and beginning to accumulate scratches which can only be seen when I hold the phone at a sharp angle so the light reflects off the case.  In normal conditions it looks undamaged.  The case is smooth plastic and slides quickly and easily out of my pocket.Everything that requires access can be used through holes in the case, except for the power button.  For that, the case has a thin, raised spot that I thought would be difficult to use, but it's very easy--almost no extra force is required.The case was very easy to put on, but is difficult to remove.  Since I don't have a reason to remove it, I never do.I haven't had it for long, but so far it doesn't seem to be stretching or losing its shape at all.I'll update this review if there are problems later on, but for now, this case is perfect for me.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B003ZHV6D0', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B003ZHV6D0', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B0018L4GOQ</h2>    <p class="price"> $B0018L4GOQ</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

I didn't realize that if I pushed the mini-usb connection in harder, it would snap together and make a very solid connection.This adapter is small and has a feature I like and a small issue that is annoying.  I have a gaming headset at home with a long USB cable for charging but I would like to charge my phone as well so this adapter is a good solution.  I like that the cord keeps it attached to the main USB cord (it's not necessary, but a helpful feature).  Unfortunately I'm having the occasional issue with it not charging and I believe it is because of the adapter not having a great connection.  Moving the adapter fixes the issue and my phone starts charging.  I think it earns a solid 4 stars.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0018L4GOQ" id="B0018L4GOQ-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-06-14:</strong> This thing is handy, as I tether it to a USB mini patch cord, so I can charge my Droid (micro), my tablet (mini), or any other device that charges via mini or micro usb.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0018L4GOQ" id="B0018L4GOQ-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-04-14:</strong> I recently received several Nokia E63 phones for family members.

After the initial "failure" I've found that I can wrap or coil the cord around the device to maintain the angle or pressure on the connection - which works about 80-90% of the time.

Were they can just stick a stubby adaptor onto a mini usb ordinary cord that almost every single person has laying around their computer. This thing save me space and the ugliness of extra cords hanging from my laptop or computer. Plus it save a usb port on the computer because I can now use the USB mini phone to charge my blackberry and then stick this adaptor onto to it and charge my Plantronics bluetooth headset. Plantronics wanted 30.00 bucks for a "AC" wall adaptor which is down right crazy and wasteful. The planet is being crowded by "Ewaste" and plastic junk.. No need for individual charger for each and every item let alone each new model of phone or gizmo. They need to standardize thing Nokia does as well as blackberry. This thing was perfect to just tie to my mini usb cord and then have both cord possibilities near by. One in the car and one near the computer.The price can not be beat. Only thing was it did take almost 2 weeks to get shipped to me.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0018L4GOQ" id="B0018L4GOQ-review53" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-06-17:</strong> I purchased this to go w/ Motorola Portable Charger: it was a must as the charger on it's own: the connections didn't fit.Fine product, great price, timely delivery.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0018L4GOQ" id="B0018L4GOQ-review54" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-08:</strong> Strap stays on the cord so you can change from mini to micro without losing it.

This pair fills that gap between too expensive and cheaply made without sacrificing quality for iOS devices.The look of the headphones was clean and the magnetic and interchangeable colored panels (they call them tags) on the earpieces allow you to have some customization in the look. I like that the headphones came with two additional sets of colors.  You can see how it looks in their images above. They panels were so simple to swap out.The foam padding around the ear pieces felt great. While these are not noise cancelling headphones, the memory foam did reduce some outside noise. Not having the noise reduction technology keeps the cost down as well. I wore them around the house for quite a long time. Most headphones begin to hurt after a while. I did not notice that with these.  I also like how the earpieces folded down to allow you to hang them on your neck easier when not in use.The audio quality was not bad at all. These are not perfection for the audiophile nor or they meant to be. It did not have the heavy bass enhancements most headphones try now thinking that makes everything better. They played cleanly and sounded good.  The in-line audio controls on the cord allowed you start/stop/forward/back of your audio.The in-line controller also has a noise reduction microphone for use as a phone headset. Hearing the other caller was clear and they did not have any complaints over my voice quality until the in-line controller rolled over. I love how they made the controller closer to the face instead of way down the cord. This means the microphone for the phone is actually near my mouth.  They were missing a clip to hold it at the right angle though. You can also use the in-line controller to pick up and disconnect from calls.The packaging itself was a little overkill to be honest. They could reduce that down a bunch. It is like they tried to make it stand out on the gaming shelves (they have many headsets in that area) or against other headsets.Overall, a recommended product with good sound, good pricing, audio controls and double use as a phone headset for iOS devices.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FF1EBLS" id="B00FF1EBLS-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-07:</strong> These are really great sounding, clear, comfortable headphones! I've tried many different types, all price ranges, and these are the best I've used yet. I will say that they are the most expensive I've tried but they are worth the price of under $80.00. They do cut out the room noise really well. My 17 year old daughter tried to claim them after hearing how awesome they are!! (you know how teenagers are!) Of course I told her, too bad, so sad!!

However, when given the opportunity to try out the Kunai headset by Tritton (Do they really have their name in all caps?) I stopped using my JBLs and used the Kunai for a month straight and am relatively satisfied with the results.Despite the large nature of my head (being 6'5 and all), the Kunai fit relatively comfortable on my noggin with room to spar.  This is uncommon as most headphones are designed for smaller people below 6 feet tall and look more like miniature Mickey Mouse ears on me than actual headphones and are just as (un)comfortable.  Now, to put their comfort to the test, I immediately took them with me for a 2-mile brisk walk around the neighborhood in 75 degree weather.  Not hot, by any stretch, but warm enough to get me to sweat a little and see how well the Kunai handle under those conditions.  They did well as they stayed on my head without any serious shifting and/or sticking to my face as others had done in the past.After a few days of subjecting the Kunai to walking around hard outdoors, and performing relatively well I might add, I then wore them outside on the porch during my downtime after a shift for about a week to see how comfortable they were in a relaxing environment where comfort is more heavily scrutinized.  The Kunai seemed relatively comfortable even while in direct sunlight and I was just sitting there observing every minute detail in the headphones.It was also during these trials that I noticed more about the sound quality.  It's not going to bring the house down but they're good and, more importantly, balanced.  My biggest criticism of competing headphones, most notably Beats, is that they place an overwhelming emphasis on base power and not clarity or balance making the ear pieces all about bass and nothing else; it just ruins high-quality soundtracks and songs.  The Kunai are an excellent balance between bass and clarity allowing me to hear every detail in my songs, which are highly comprised of instrumental soundtracks from film and gaming.  They won't bring the house down but I can tell that the Kunai are more tailored towards casual and economic listening rather than the higher end.As for ease of use with the iPhone, I performed several call tests outside and in my loud laundry room to see how well the person on the other end could hear me and they worked VERY well.  It's handy to have headphones that don't need to be removed during calls allowing me to listen to music and take calls seamlessly.  HOWEVER, despite the instructions tell me that the Kunai are compatible with my iPhone 4s in terms of using the song skip features, I can only seem to get the play/pause button to work.  Perhaps I missed a step but that shouldn't be the case.  Oh well.Oh, and you can change the color of the panels on the muffs to be either black, orange, or red&#8230; cool, I guess.  I never changed them from their detailed black and threw out the replacement panels.  I don't wear orange, anyway.All in all, the Kunai are a good quality set for the price.  Won't bring down the house like JBL or Klipsch will, but they're good quality all the same.  I'm still going back to my JBLs, though.  :P</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FF1EBLS" id="B00FF1EBLS-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-04:</strong> I have a lot of headphones and headsets. I have Bluetooth models, a couple high-end wired ones, some studio headphones for when I'm making music, and other little cheap-o earbuds and things for convenience. That said, I rarely use most of them. Some are just uncomfortable, some are inconvenient, and some don't please me with their audio quality. For the record, I absolutely HATE beats by Dre (and Monster, masters of overpriced accessories and hyperbole) and I'm none-too-fond of 50-Cent's bass-heavy headphones, either. My favorite `phones have been my trusty Koss PortaPlay (purchased 20 years ago, and still outperforming most in the price range and lasting longer) and my BlueAnt headset. My least favorites (aside from the aforementioned fashion accessories by Dre and 50-Cent) are most earbuds packed in with anything, and my first pair of lower-priced, over-ear Sony Studio Headphones, which had excellent sound quality but had a tendency to crush my ears and head, making extended use impossible.When I got the TRITTON Kunai headset I was expecting something in the middle-of-the-line range, and for the most part that's what I got. However, the build quality and sound are much better than I expected from accessory company Mad Catz, who have made some of my least-favorite controllers and game accessories over the years. Clearly, they brought their A-game to this headset. I was impressed.&#9658; Build: The TRITTON Kunai feels nice and solid. The whole unit has a nice rubberized feel. It's like these headphones were made with shark skin. They're sturdy, and the magnetic, replaceable, colored side panels allow some customization without a lot of effort.The cable is hard-wired into the headphones-- something I consider a negative-- and the in-line controls are, in my opinion, WAY too close to the main unit (and your head) making it impossible for you to look at the controls when you use them. I would have preferred the controls to be lower by about 6", because I'm not always certain I'm hitting the right button despite the raised symbols on them. My fingers just aren't that sensitive, and I'd like to look at the controls when I use them sometimes.The ear cups are very soft and feel great. Oddly, they're rectangular-shaped instead of circular or oval. They do a great job of sealing and providing maximum comfort while blocking out the outside world and keeping your music or phone conversation to yourself.The cord itself could be longer at 3.9 feet. It's not a major complaint, but with it being hardwired into the main unit, it means you have to consider an extension if you need more slack.&#9658; Sound Quality: These have a range of 20 Hz - 20 kHz. What that means is that don't get super-bassy, though they handle bass well, and they don't get up in the highs that I, as an adult, can no longer even hear. That's OK for me. For a teenager these might seem a little more limited in range because they can hear more high notes than I can.The mids are fine, not muddy or "thick", and everything is clear. As headphones go, these are a couple notches above average in terms of audio quality, but they're not any threat to Sennheiser, Klipsch or even some of BlueAnt's best stuff. I think they're better than the bass-heavy, muddy garbage by Dre or 50-Cent, but then I'm not a huge hip hop fan (at least, not hip hop after 1990) and like to hear details in my music, which the TRITTON Kunai handles admirably well. Again, not top-of-the-line by any means, but certainly not junk like many headphones on the market these days.As noted previously, these aren't super-bassy. If you're a bass fan, you may want to stick with the other guys. If you want clear bass that mixes with the rest of the music, then these might do the trick.For voice, they're good. They do add a richness to voice calls that isn't present in my Bluetooth headsets and earpieces, and they do a great job of filtering out noise.&#9658; Function: The TRITTON Kunai headset is pretty specific in the title about being for Apple iPod, iPhone, and iPad. This isn't a lie. I tried these on my Android phone and they worked fine as a headset, but the controls were completely useless. None of the in-line controls worked. I couldn't control volume, playback, pausing, or answering the phone with them. This could be because my phone didn't play nice, or it could be that they were serious about the whole "for Apple" thing.However, in the quick-start guide, they also list the PS Vita, Nintendo 3DS, the Wii U gamepad, and "Tablets/Phones" as being compatible. What "compatible" means is questionable. I guess your mileage may vary. The packaging says the in-line controls are only compatible with Apple devices, so I'm thinking the compatibility with those other devices may not include the in-line controls and is only referring to their function as a headset. You can get the microphone and headphones to work but you can't control the device with the headphones.On my iPad mini, the TRITTON Kunai performed well. Double-clicking the middle button skipped tracks. Single-clicking paused and played. the volume buttons worked as they should. I was pleased, and found myself wishing these controls worked on my Android phone.&#9658; Packaging/Info: The packaging is, frankly, a mess. I won't consider this in my review score, but it should be known that Mad Catz really made a messy package here. The outside sleeve has ALL information presented in five different languages, which makes it cluttered and hard to find what you're looking for.Inside, they provide a two-page quick-start guide and direct you to go online for a full manual. Considering the price of this headset, I'd think a physical manual wouldn't be too much to ask of them.They also provide some stickers with the TRITTON logo on them. I have no idea what I'd use these for, but perhaps they'll appeal to teenagers who like stuff on their locker or Trapper-Keeper. To me, they're silly fluff and I'd rather have seen them spend the printing efforts and material on a real manual.&#9658;&#9658; The Bottom Line:  The TRITTON Kunai Stereo Headset by Mad Catz is a great wired companion to your iOS device. Good sound, excellent comfort and build quality, and some nice customizing touches make this headset a good choice. I have to dock a point for the short cord and in-line controls too close to the main unit, making it a little more awkward to use them. This lost point is also considering the odd choice to include stickers instead of documentation. Still, this is a well-built headset that will satisfy most buyers who want it for an Apple device.If you're looking at this headset for Android, Windows Phone, or any other device, you may want to knock another star off my review, because the headset won't do much of what you're looking for, and it's not designed for those devices. It will support them to some degree, but it's not going to do the job if you want in-line controls.Recommendation:  If you're an Apple device owner, get it. If you're not an Apple device owner, shop around first.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FF1EBLS" id="B00FF1EBLS-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-19:</strong> I like over-the-ear headsets, but never for very long.

This replaceable piece is over the ear and if you have more than one headset, it is nice to distinguish which one is yours.Although it is said that the headset is for iPhone, iPad, iPod, I initially tested it on my Windows7 Laptop and it worked well, although the controls for volume did not work (and they were not supposed to work). Then I tested on my iPhone and yes, everything worked as advertised! Finally I tested it on my sound equipment. Again the controls did not work, but the quality of reproduction of the sound is really amazing. Impressive how much of the exterior sound is filtered and how comfortable this headset is. I used for 2 consecutive hours and it did not bother me at all.If I could just suggest for the designers to place the control 20cm farther from the headset down the wire, this would be perfect, but this is just me and this minor issue is not enough to prevent me from grading this product with 5 starts.I recommend this product to any person who is serious about hearing quality sound.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00FF1EBLS', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00FF1EBLS', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00329QP5A</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00329QP5A</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

But I'm partially deaf and these in-ear stereo earphones make it possible for me to talk to people on my cell phone (Nexus 4). In many cases if I didn't have my wife to translate, I'd get lost attempting to understand people using the phone normally or in speaker mode.  These earphones do away with that problem.  Music is much more to the bass side than my Koss C-100s that are only good for listening, but not so much so that I might bother changing. The Koss are not nearly as portable and I think of them mainly as a computer accessory. That the iKross in-ears come with three sizes of ear buds is pretty much the icing on the cake on a pair of easy to transport earphones that suit my situation perfectly.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00329QP5A" id="B00329QP5A-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-04:</strong> I was unable to hear or be heard during my incoming phone conversations after about five weeks of the purchase.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00329QP5A" id="B00329QP5A-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-16:</strong> I got this for a gift, I tried before that I gave it to my friend and almost keep it, but I didn't.

I had ordered two other EVO cases at the same time as this one.  This case was the last to arrive which bummed me out a little but still I can't really complain about that.  The case is beautiful, prettier than it looked on the computer and so far the gems are staying on nicely.  The case itself appears to be white with a silver "sticker" covering it, the gems are attached to the sticker with glue.  The other case I purchased at the same time as this one arrived right away and seemed to be made the same, with a similar silver "sticker" with the gems also glued to the sticker; however, on the other case I ordered the sticker was not completely glued to the case around the edges and the gems started falling off as soon as I took it out of the plastic.  This case is a much better quality product.  I have even picked at the sticker a little and the gems to see if they would fall off easily and I would have the same problem with this case as I'm having with the other case, but the sticker and the gems are not coming off.  They really seem to be attached very well and I have not lost a gem yet!  (Nearly all the gems on the top part of the other case I purchased have fallen off and it's been about a week.)  I'm extremely happy with the quality of this product.  I've noticed that some of the other reviews have stated that their gems were falling off upon delivery so I guess it just depends of the batch the case comes from, etc.  In any event I've very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003VCJTSS" id="B003VCJTSS-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-09-20:</strong> Bought one of these for my daughter and she loves it, definitely will buy her another.

But other than that its a great armband.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008818IL6" id="B008818IL6-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-29:</strong> Fit my arm, did not get cloudy works as advertised.

My only complaint is that the band does not seem to be very flexible. There is a small part that has elastic for it to flex, but does not seem to give too much. If you plan on wearing it on your upper arm, please note that the strap is on the shorter side. I am by no means a body builder (though I am not a scrawny guy either) and the strap barely fits on my upper arm (bicep/tricep) - about 1&#34; to spare. Also when you go to move your arm or lift anything up, the lack of flex in the band makes it difficult to find a good fit. I tend to use it while cycling where my arm stays in a single position so it is not a huge deal for me.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008818IL6" id="B008818IL6-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-27:</strong> I love this thing.

Also the glare off the plastic cover along with my device screen protector makes it impossible to see at any angles while on my arm.

According to the advertized specs I should be able to recharge my ipod touch or my phone three times before the battery is drained!  Add to that an LED light that while not as bright as a tactical light is plenty bright enough for utility use.  there are red/green LEDs under the clear semi-circular flashlight switch to indicate if it is charging or full when the micro USB cable is inserted.  No lights when you are charging other objects, but honestly they have charging indicators on their screens so it isn't really necessary.Only minor issue I had was that seller contacted me a few days after order and told me that the lot of black units they had on hand were defective and wanted to know if a pink one could be substituted.  I said yes and covered the pink anodizing with a piece of tape.  Now that I've used it for a bit I'm thinking a piece of shrink tubing is in order for a more permanent fix.  Not a major issue obviously, but I don't tend to get hung up on such things.Bottom line, great  product.

It has buttons to control the music volume and skipping songs. You could also push the button to answer calls, like any other regular Apple head-sets. But the sound quality is really what kills it for me. The regular Apple head-set sounds so much better than this. I'd rather give up on the sporty design for the better sound quality. That'd be my choice.

The effect it has is that you are listening to the radio,  but can hear all the background noise perfectly clearly.  I liked that for walking down busy New York streets and still being able to hear a car horn or your name being called out (I've had friends accuse me of 'blanking them' when I was wearing other noise cancelling headsets.)  My only concern that they were a bit fiddly for me to put on and because I wear glasses with quite thick plastic arms,  it felt a bit crowded behind my ears.  I think if I wore ultrathin wire frames (or no glasses at all) it wouldn't be an issue,  but the these ear pieces are thicker than normal and it wasn't immediately comfortable.Sound quality was good,  and connection to the rest of the world was also good,  comfort was average,  I liked them.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005C9G2P6" id="B005C9G2P6-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-09-19:</strong> I wear headphones a lot: At work, on public transit, at the gym, you name it. The popular, over-the-ear headphones are great if you don't want something particularly portable and don't mind having your hair restyled every time you take them off. If these things are a concern, then earbuds are the way to go. But the earbud-style headphones are a problem at the gym. They fall out. The cords are too long and get tangled in the equipment. On transit and at work, the open-air style of most earbuds doesn't block outside noise very well. Enter the Jabra SPORT.PROS1. BUILD QUALITY. The build quality of these headphones is immediately apparent. They use high-quality cording and the connection points are sturdy. My Apple headphones fall apart a lot because I'm hard on them. These Jabra earbuds will definitely sustain far more wear and tear than typical earbuds.2. SHORT CORD. At the gym, my headphone cord often gets wrapped around some element of one of the machines and yanks my earbuds out. The short cord prevents this from happening by eliminating slack.3. EXTENSION CORD. The cord extension supplied with the headphones attaches easily to the headset and gives you a more typical cord length.4. TACTILE REMOTE CONTROL. The on-cord remote control is more tactile than the one on the earbuds supplied by Apple. The three raised dots make it easy to manipulate your music or phone call while exercising.5. STAY IN PLACE. The wrap-around design keeps these headphones in place regardless of the vigor of your activity. They're pliable and can be manipulated for a custom fit.6. ACOUSTICS: For earbuds, I find the sound quite good. The comfort eargels actually improve the acoustics when correctly positioned and can improve the bass significantly. Be sure to try all three. Finding the right ones to fit your ears make a huge difference in sound and the headset's ability to block out outside noise.CONS1. COMFORT. My ears are physically fatigued after wearing these for a while. The get sore from the multiple contact points and from positioning them for the best sound. In addition, glasses wearers beware. The wrap-around position is not the best for you and the weight of your glasses will add further discomfort.2. INSTALLATION. Installing these on my ears is a bit of a pain. They're not like popping in a couple of earbuds or slapping on pair of over-the-ear headphones. They take some manipulation to get the sound, comfort, and stability right. You'll find yourself rethinking removing them for conversation.3. APPEARANCE. Why does yellow = sports? How about neutral black or white? Especially something wrapping around my ear. I want subtle. A coworker pronounced that they'd look fine at the gym, but she wouldn't wear them on the bus.Overall I think these headphones are solid and bolster more pluses than minuses, but I'd definitely consider the cons if you wear your headphones a lot, care about appearances, and frequently pull your headphones on and off of your head.****UPDATEI am less impressed with these headphones over time. The sound is sub-par and when working out for long periods of time, they chafe the area behind my ears...once so bad that there was bleeding. I still think they are built well, but maybe too well. Too much going on around the ear than is really necessary.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005C9G2P6" id="B005C9G2P6-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-09-26:</strong> The regular Apple headsets would fall out of the ears when used for running. These ones are perfect - and I especially like the extension when I place my ipod on my belt. If you have a small mp3 player on your armband, you can use it without the extension.

However, the sound comes in clean and crisp; you can still hear outside sounds such as sirens and bells if you wear them out.  As an added bonus, you get an extension cord as well as a short cord to carry as an armband.If you like to jog, bike or just walk, you don't have to worry about these falling out.  They are weather friendly and can withstand the rain.  They can also withstand sweat.  Clips assure you that they can be securely fastened to your clothing, such as when you ride your bike or use exercise equipment.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005C9G2P6" id="B005C9G2P6-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-10-20:</strong> Overall, this is a good headset. I wanted to try these out because they looked more comfortable than other over-ear headsets - and they are! The sound is also quite good. And I feel like I get good volume out of them on my iPhone as well. Something about the cord in conjunction with the earpieces makes for terrible tangling in my bag, but that's more a reflection on me than the product.Pros:Clear soundBendy over-ear bits really are bend-to-fit! With a little practice, I could get them to stay on.Most comfortable over-ear headset I've triedHigh-quality microphoneModular/2-piece cord - so you can make the cord shorter or longer depending on where your audio device is (armband vs pocket for example)Clip on the cord - so simple, but so usefulCord seems well made and durable (haven't killed it yet!)Cons:Bass is a little weak but not horribleNot easy to put on quickly (such as when trying to answer the phone)Still not super-comfortable to wear for a long time (more than an hour)I think they're worth the price.

I love that they allow me to turn on my music, start jogging, and forget about them completely.  So many headphones hurt my ears and these don't at all and they don't fall out or slip at all.  The only thing I don't like about them is that they only work with Apple products.  I can use them with my iPod but not my laptop.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005C9G2P6" id="B005C9G2P6-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-20:</strong> These headphones were probably the most durable corded headphones I have used in a long time. I used these headphones for around 4 hours a day, 5 days a week for 8 months before they finally began to short in one and eventually both ears.  However, their longevity was extended by the two part cord, the bottom part of which went after about 3 months.  This compares to an average life of about 3 weeks for a pair of skullcandy headphones.And now the pros and consPros:1) Build quality: Top quality flat cord helps prevent tangles and also reduces strain on the headphone ends.2) In line volume, ff/rw and pause play: another feature that increases life as the less often you pull your phone out the less strain you put on the cord.3) decent microphone quality.4) Two stage cord.5) Storage bag: Came with a zippered bag for storing when not in use, which always helps reduce damage to the phones and increase life.Cons:1) Poor audio quality: sound was both tinny and lacked strong bass.  I listen to a lot of audiobooks and even in that non-intense media I could detect a marked decrease in sound quality as compared to other headphones I have used.2) Main cord is too short:  Another couple of inches and the main cord by itself would have reached comfortably to my pants pocket.  I found that once the extension broke, I had to keep the cord in a jacket pocket, which was much less conveinent.3) No offset headphone jack.  An offset jack would have reduced strain on the connections further and increased durability further.4) UNBELIEVABLY UNCOMFORTABLE:  I used these headphones because I try to only replace headphones when they break.  But these were some of the most uncomfortable headphones I have ever used.  No matter which attachment I used my ears would start to feel bruised after about 40 minuets, and at times I almost felt like the headphones were cutting into my ears.Conclusion:Although these headphones lasted a long time (relatively) I kinda wished they hadn't. Between poor sound quality and poor comfort these left a lot to be desired.  I would recommend finding another pair of headphones that have a flat cord, or even better splurging a little bit for a decent pair of Bluetooth headphones, that way you won't have to worry about damaging the cord.  Don't however, buy these headphones.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005C9G2P6" id="B005C9G2P6-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-12:</strong> Got these and knew who could evaluate them best:  my daughter who is a triathlete.

The sound and durability confirm to me that I won't be in the market for a new pair for a long time... unless he loses them!  Ugh!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005C9G2P6" id="B005C9G2P6-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-09-22:</strong> The Jabra Sport headset provides a welcome change from earbuds for use when exercising; gone are the days of trying to maintain your stride/focus while re-seating an earbud.  By looping comfortably around your ear, these stay firmly in place, without any need for adjustment.  The sound quality is more than adequate, although, to be fair, not on the same par as some of the high end earbuds on the market.  Moreover, the cord includes an extension, so if you carry your player in a case on your arm, it can be removed to prevent excess cord from flopping around.  Moreover, there is a clip on the cord to further prevent movement, as well as a small set of buttons that control volume and skip tracks; it is worth mentioning hear that while these are sold as for Apple devices only, they worked just fine with my Motorola Droid X, with the exception of volume control.On the downside, as other reviewers have mentioned, the earpieces are a little on the large side, which I suppose is necessary to hold them in place, but the result is that over time they can become...uncomfortable may be too strong a word, but certainly annoying.  The point is you are aware they are there, rather than other smaller earbuds, which I tend to forget about after a few songs.  This is the price you pay for them to stay in place during exercise, but the point is you probably won't want to wear them to listen to music at the grocery store or while lying around the house, it's just not what they are made for.All in and all, I am very pleased with this headset.  The design is thoughtful, the sound quality is good, and above all they stay in place.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005C9G2P6" id="B005C9G2P6-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-10-19:</strong> I've been looking for a hardy set of earphones to use while running/biking. The last pair I had lasted all of a couple months before they give into the jostling and pressure caused by my intense, lightning speed workouts. The Apple earbuds last a little longer, but they eventually fail as well. I needed something bigger, faster, stronger.Enter Jabra SPORT headset. These puppies are heavy-duty and seem very durable. They're also not terribly heavy, which is nice and they fit nicely around the ear, which gives the cord more support when I'm jumping over small cars or flying up Everest-ish mountains. The sound quality is great too. Good volume and an even EQ balance between bass and treble. There's a handy volume control, a microphone (for those ever-important phone calls while you're tearing up 13.1), and an extension cord that works nicely to adjust the cord from arm-based music player to a hand or pocket-based player.This specific product works with iPod, iPhone, and iPad (not sure what kind of extreme sporting activities you'll be doing with a tablet computer, but these headphones allow that) with in-line volume control and a remote to answer calls. It doesn't guarantee the quality of your phone call while you're trucking down the trails, but it guarantees that you can make them!Overall, this is a great product in its functionality and performance- and it's long-lasting (so far). A great buy!*** As it turns out, Jabra also has excellent customer service. You should feel very confident with your purchase.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005C9G2P6" id="B005C9G2P6-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-09-22:</strong> First off, the add on gel ear pieces are a pain to use. They really don't help at all.Unlike the ones by Bose, which are really snug and blocks outside noise just right.These are too big even for the default ones, so after wearing them for 30 min, my ears hurt.It also feels quite heavy and burdensome.The thin cord itself is really nice, bright yellw and very strong.The problem is the basic cord (without the extension) is toooooo short.  I know this is meant for a sports, jugging use, but it is still too short.  I think 6 more inches would make it perfect.With that said, the extension is a joke.  The female plug is way tooo lose.  I used it a few times and sometimes just lightly pulling the cord would result the cord coming lose from the extension cord.The included pouch is a great thing and they must include this because of the fact you never know when you might need the extension cable.The sound:  quality is mediocre at best.There's no base, the high's not clear or crisp enough.  The mid sounds not rich enough.For $70, I would expect the sound quality to be above average, at least not too inferior to senheiser low end or bose mid grade products.  But this is by far very low end sound quality, maybe a $15-20 range.I guess Jabra is good at making phone heasets but not stereo headphones.  So, you have to use this on a phone to appreciate it since they expect the user to care more about phone call quality than music enjoyment.Also, there's a basic design flaw in this.With the ear overhang design, they intended for you to hang the cord to your back then down to the arm where you have your ipod nano or other tiny MP3 music players.  How would that help when you have a phone call?  The mic and the buttons on the cord are now on your back, how would you press it?If they designed this and the length of cord, is intended for an arm-placement music player, why would you design it so the buttons are behind your neck? (how can one talk to the mic which is behind the buttons?)Someone please tell me what's the reason behind that?So far, I have not seen anyone wearing an iPhone on their arm while jugging.  It is too heavy.If you say this is for putting the iPhone on the rack when you use the running treadmill, then, I ask again, why would you put the cord buttons to the back of your neck?  So, there's a basic design flaw in my opinion.Anyhow, to wrap it up, I would not recomend this product unless they improve upon the tonal quality first and then at least improve the extension cord attachment plug and the minimum length of the main cord.Then, lower the price to about $59 retail.  It should sell well.3 stars.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005C9G2P6" id="B005C9G2P6-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-10-03:</strong> I have never been a big fan of over-the-ear headphones, finding them difficult to position and with subpar audio quality, and these headphones did not change my opinion.  If you want headphones that are easy to use and offer great audio quality - I would move on to buds.However, if you do want over-the-ear for a variety of good reasons, I think the Jabra's are a very good choice. While a bit difficult to mount on your ears, once you do have them in place they hold quite well.  They are very well constructed, and I especially like the heavy duty short cord - and the longer extension.  It tends not to tangle like standard cords.  And they are the best sounding over-the-ear phones I have experienced - so overall a very good choice if this is the style of headphone you are looking for.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005C9G2P6" id="B005C9G2P6-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-09-21:</strong> The positives:- can withstand rain- rubberize plastic all over- nice feel- Does not overcompensate the bass (Very common for earphones to do this)- Good natural soundNOTE:If you are thinking this might work with Android - don't waste your time. It does not. While the audio obviously works, neither the volume controls nor the answer call button work at all.I am not marking it down due to this - I just know that sometimes manufacturers says it only works with X product when in reality it works with more. This one does not. Only with Apple devices.Two warnings:A friend with smaller ears tried these on and they were simply too big, she tried to arrange these to see if she could get them to work, but to no avail.So if you have small ears, I suggest you pass on this pair.These fit me just fine, however, the feel quite lose, and they kept moving away from the year (not quite falling out, but to the point where I couldn't hear one side very well), this even with light excercise. I will keep experimenting with how to put these on, but they don't seem to really stay on you very well. Since this is one of the main selling points of this headset, I wanted to caution potential buyers on this.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005C9G2P6" id="B005C9G2P6-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-09-20:</strong> I really wanted to like these because I have been looking for a quality headset to go running for ages.  However, it really wasn't to be.  On first glance, the quality of the headset and the cord are very good.  The rubber seems strong and resistant to tearing while each ear-piece looks very water resistant.  However, from that point on, I had some difficulties with the headset.  First, I couldn't really get the ear loops to hold the headset snugly in place.  Jabra notes that they can be bent to a more comfortable position but they never seemed to stay in place.  Second, the eargels didn't really secure the earphone into my ear canal.  Candidly, they fit no better than your standard iPhone headsets.  As a result, the sound quality of the speakers is pretty lackluster: blaring midrange, shattering treble and bass that wasn't tight and responsive.  Now, maybe I am not giving enough credit to the fact that these are sports earphones but I do like nice audio when I'm working out and alas, these just couldn't do the job well for me.  Perhaps if you can make a better fit the sound would be better, but I wasn't able to do so.So, 2 stars: quality construction appears quite good but fit and audio quality were big detractors.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005C9G2P6" id="B005C9G2P6-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-09-22:</strong> These Jabra Sport headphones did not offer any redeeming quality to me.  First, the rubber eargels were extremely difficult to get on the headset.  They didn't just pop right on, you had to really work them on.  Second, the headphones don't stay attached to your ears.  Unless your ear is perfectly shape to conform to the headsets, it is a bad fit.  I bended them and they stayed in place for a few seconds and then popped of my ear.  Maybe I'm just not used to this style of headset as this is my first pair of the style, but you shouldn't have to work this hard to get earphones to stay in your ear.  When I did actually get to listen to my iPod, the sound quality was fine, but certainly nothing to write home about.  As for the cord, it is a nice feature with the clip and extension, but certainly not enough to save this headset from being substandard.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005C9G2P6" id="B005C9G2P6-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-09-20:</strong> Pros:1.  These headphone deliver above average sound quality.  I'm comparing them to the white earbud headphones that come with an iPhone or iPod.  There is a little more bass and treble sounds good.  They are able to be played quite loud without distortion2.  The headphones stay in my ears while working out.  Just tested them out on a 30 minute jog and had no issues with them coming off (or even moving out of position) while using them.  Definitely a plus compared to standard earbud headphones3.  There is a handy clip that can be used to secure the cord to your shirt.  Keeps the cord from flopping around during a run.  Nice touch.4.  The headphones are connected to a 2 foot cord and come with a 2 foot cord extension. I love this feature.  I have a jogging pullover coat that has a zipper pocket in the sleeve.  When I put my iPod in it, I only need about 1 foot of cord to get the headphones to my ears.  Using the headphones without the extension cord for this gets rid of a lot of unnecessary cord that I would have to tuck into my coat.  But then if I want a longer cord I have the option.  I think all headphones should do this.5.  There is a nice +/- volume control about 8" down the right earphone cord.  It also has the ability to pause and start music playback.  Hand especially if you're using your iPod in a zipped pocket and you would like to control the volume without having to access the device.Cons:1.  The earbuds start to become uncomfortable after a while.  The part that fits in my ear seems a bit large, and after about 45 minutes of use I'm ready to take them out.  This is using the smallest of 3 rubber eargels.  Using the earbuds without an eargel causes them to become less stable in the ear and they tend to get dislodged from the ear when running.  Someone with larger ears may not have this issue.  Although they do become a bit uncomfortable after a period of use, I still plan on using them to workout because of all the other benefits they provide.2.  The headphones come with a compact case, which is nice for travel, but getting them, along with 4 feet of cord can be a bit tricky.  I would have preferred a slightly larger case that would be easier to get the headphones in.Overall I like these headphones, they are great for working out and provide reasonable sound quality.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005C9G2P6" id="B005C9G2P6-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-09-22:</strong> This sports headset works as advertised.

This SPORT headset doesn't disappoint in the quality of sound, but it disappoints in the way I put on and adjust the headset. It took me a considerable time to figure out how to place each earpiece, adjust it around my earlobe and ensure it stays in it (size wise). Once this is done, you won't be disappointed.The earphones come with an extension cable allow you to extend the length between your ears and your pocket, giving you the chance to place your device in a secure pack around your waste. This is a benefit for those of that frequently exercise with our iPODs.Overall, I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to my friends and family.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005C9G2P6" id="B005C9G2P6-review22" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-09-20:</strong> If you were to judge this product by what you see on the outside packaging, you would never know about the extra features that make these headphones stand apart from the others.For example:* Paired with Endomondo's app, you can get your updated workout stats READ ALOUD TO YOU through the headset!* Military rated for rain, dust, and shock protection!* With the "control box" (or what looks like a buil-in microphone) you canTake phone calls (and end them)Adjust volumePlay or Pause musicSkip to the next trackControl the Voice-Over feature of your Apple device.

Excellent! Plenty of bass once you get the speakers comfortably into your ear.CONS:The bright yellow color is, in my opinion, too loud (pun intended.)Also, my ears are too small for these. There is no way to make the speakers smaller of course, therefore, none of the different ear gels/forms that come with it will work for me. If you don't get them in snug, you lose all the bass. Maybe there are more feminine ones that are smaller? I don't know.Overall, the features seem to justify the price tag.

They also have a volume button in easy reach that works with the phone.  I used these on a recent jog, and I found these functions quite useful.But on the minus side, the sound isn't that great.  It's okay for spoken word, but sucky for music.  Also, I'm used to noise-canceling phones, and like those much better.  With these, I can hear everything, which is okay for running outside, but would be horrible in a gym, where they'd be competing with the music over the speakers.

They slowly went back to the original shape.  I don't know if the headset I received was damaged, but I found that, at times, the left ear piece didn't work. I had to wiggle the cord to get it to work properly.  I was also a bit disappointed with the sound quality. It was okay, but nothing impressive.

This case is exactly what I was hoping for.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EPMOIKC" id="B00EPMOIKC-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-07:</strong> This case looks well made, but after I put it on and started using it I noticed some weak spots, like the top and bottom.

I only give this case a 4/5 cuz it doesn't like screen protectors very much. Mine keeps wanting to peel up some of the screen protector which annoys me. The case itself was difficult to put on properly. I found the best way was to put the rubber sleeve on the phone, and place the hard plastic outer shell on a flat surface, and then jam the phone into it by pushing all 4 corners at the same time. It's easier to do than to describe honestly.Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase.It's very cheap compared to others, especially for the quality.It has fully protected my phone thus far but I'm really good with my electronics, I haven't dropped it yet.

I first purchased this case for my Galaxy S3. Fit my phone very snug, and protected it very well from a few falls. I got along with it so well that I decided to buy it for my G2 and it did not disappoint. The rubber/silicone part fits really tight/snug on the phone and the hard shell fits just as tightly and firm over the rubber. it adds a nice grip for me as I have large hands and in my opinion does not bulk the phone up too much. it has a really nice lip on the front part that keeps the screen from touching any surface once its laid flat.I love that the rubber also covers the buttons on the back and makes it MUCH easier to know which one your finger is on. All of the holes line up great with no issues. Would highly recommend this case to anyone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00EPMOIKC', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00EPMOIKC', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00CDYJ6FQ</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00CDYJ6FQ</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

This model does not include a Bluetooth transceiver to deliver A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile) capabilities when connected to any player that has a standard 3.5 mm audio output jack. If such a device is needed to, for example, listen to Internet radio off a computer, then theAltec Lansing 906/R US BackBeat Headphone with Dongleis recommended.You get the following in the box:- Stereo headphones- with one pair of silicone ear buds (still trying to find a source for replacements)- Charger working through a USB Micro connection- English/Spanish manual, pretty good, actuallyMy review will first discuss features that I deem important then, I will close with a brief evaluation.Headphones:=========While not 'high end', they deliver a reasonably good quality sound. Some may have issues with headphones that go 'in' the ear rather than covering the ear. I know that I do but I seem to tolerate these quite well for as long as the volume is kept low.On the positive side, the 2 headphones are connected with a stereo cable that goes on the back of the head. This makes the entire assembly nearly invisible when worn, especially if the person who wears them has hair :). The microphone seems to be integrated in the headphones body and it seems to work well because no one asked me to speak louder while on the phone, using the BackBeat.The main concern is 'anatomy'. I have a big head and big ears and setting the earphones was not easy in the beginning even though the telescoping and swiveling adjustments do allow for some flexibility in wearing. I find that the more I get used to them, the easier it is to wear them. Again, a positive, once set, their extremely light weight makes for a very comfortable wear, so comfortable they almost 'disappear', unless they fall off.Pairing and maintaining connections:===========================- I had no problem pairing the headphones with a Blackberry and a Motorola Razor. It all works as the manual advises. When pairing the the phone, the headphones' password is always '0000' and it can't be changed.Controls:======It may take some getting used to but, here are the simple conventions:- Phone controls are mostly on the left-ear headphone- Music device controls are mostly on the right-year headphone- Rising tones usually mean that the feature is enabled/set/increased while falling tones mean the oppositeWhen connected to a phone you can answer the call, hang up, reject the call while listening to music, mute, raise/lower the volume, check the battery charge.For music features you can pause play, advance or go back one track (not tested by me yet), increase/decrease volume, enable/disable bass boost, pick up the phone or reject a call while listening. Play resumes after a call ends.It took very little time for the controls to become second nature.Performance and other characteristics:=============================A full charge completes in about 3 hours and little blue lights indicate the charge is full. Partial charging is possible in less than one hour. Claimed battery life on both devices is about 7 hours and my usage so far tends to confirm this.A carrying pouch is missing and it's missed. I would have felt much better if one was included because the headphones are small enough to be easily lost. I understand that the design was meant to allow carrying the headphones in a shirt pocket but I would have felt much more comfortable if I could store them somewhere other than a small pocket.__________________________________I hesitate between 4 and 5 stars. The more I use the BackBeat the more I enjoy using it. However, the missing carrying case - not easy to explain on a device within this price range and the lack of information on where or how to obtain spare ear buds call for a small deduction. With only a few small improvements, Altec could have a big winner in this product.The lack of a Bluetooth transceiver was not a factor when rating this product even though I WOULD recommend the higher end model which adds a lot more versatility for only a few dollars more.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001TK3AC0" id="B001TK3AC0-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-11:</strong> This is my 2nd attempt at bluetooth earphones for my Iphone 4s, purchased via another online retailer for $30.  I like the fact that these are buds and I don't have cans on my ears.  I'd like to listen to music while walking through airports without looking too much like a dork, and these fit the bill, although the design looks a bit like a hearing aid.Sound quality is fine, but the rubber ear piece doesn't fit entirely into your ear --  just a narrow tube points into your ear canal so the outside sound is not blocked and the volume is never too loud, even at the highest settings.  Personally, I wish the max volume was a bit louder, but the set is fine.Pairing was a breeze, and I can leave my iphone on the top floor and walk around the main floor of my house wearing the 903's without any loss of signal.  Really a nice feature!  Battery life so far has been solid, no worries there.  I like the fact that I can fast forward, rewind, and adjust the volume from the ear piece.  Also handles calls well, pauses the music, then re-starts after the call is completed.For me, I may still try the Ericsson IS800's and/or the LG Tone as both of those models have more traditional earbuds that look like they'll provide a richer sound while blocking out the world.So overall, sound gets a 4, features receive a 5, battery life a 5, range gets a 5, design gets a 3.  Depending on what's important to you, this may be a great option.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001TK3AC0" id="B001TK3AC0-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-06-25:</strong> I purchased this device and had it stolen on the first day of use.  I was so pleased with the Backbeat's comfort and sound quality that I decided to purchase another pair despite owning another set of Bluetooth headphones - the Jabra BT1101.  The 1101's Bluetooth connection was spotty at time for no reason and uncomfortable after 30 minutes of use.  The ear fit was loose so the sound wasn't as "filling" as in ear headphones.  The Backbeat 903/906 are a great step up from the adequate Jabra BT 1101 headphones.Edit:After owning if for several months, I found the build quality low and customer service lacking. I still like the form factor, but the headphones no longer charge and the stems leading to the earpieces are breaking apart.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001TK3AC0" id="B001TK3AC0-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-09-15:</strong> Okay...so I read a gazillion reviews before purchasing these Bluetooth headphones.  I heard a lot of bad and I heard a lot of good.  Keep in mind that I have only had these for a day or so and will update if things change.Pros:I don't know what people are talking about...I have the iPhone 4 with the newest 4.1 update and the track foward/reverse buttons work great and the volume works great and ALL the buttons work with this headset. So the reviews that are saying some buttons don't work probably have a different phone than I do or older software.Also the design (for me) is SO comfortable! I have tiny ears so I was worried about the headset being too heavy for me.  It's not.  It is very lightweight and comfortable. I also LOVE the fact that the wire behind the head is sturdy enough that I'm not afraid I'll harm it if I tug too hard but flexible enough that I can lay in bed and watch movies or when I'm at the gym I can do my floor exercises without them pushing off my ears. The headphones even work with my Netflix on my phone so I can watch movies while I'm in class or at work! Totally awesome! Also, I like the in-the-ear feel better than on-the-ear.  So I enjoy having the headphones block out all the other sound.  I also like the open-mic feature so when I stop my music to talk to someone I can hear them clearly without them or me sounding muffled.I was able to walk through my whole house without losing connection and finally when I was at the other end and downstairs and there were walls between me and my phone that the phone finally beeped at me telling me it was losing connection.I like how since I'm a girl and have hair that you can barely tell that they are on my ears...they are not clunky and don't make me look like a techno-geek.Cons:They were a little hard to get on but that was fine with me since they were hard to get off also and I don't want them coming off since I am active.I wear glasses a lot of the time when I exercise and I had to put the headphones on FIRST and THEN the glasses.  Sometimes the glasses would push the headphones off my ears even though the they would stay in my ears and that was kind of annoying.  But it only happened about once every half hour or so.  I can live with that.I read a lot of reviews that said the battery acted up on these phones and the buttons stop working after a few weeks.  I've only had mine for a few days so I am keeping a watchful on those issues and will update later if I do have any.  I bought these from Wal-mart so hopefully they have a good return policy.  As for right now my little brother and husband have bought some too!  I am very satisfied:)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001TK3AC0" id="B001TK3AC0-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-11-01:</strong> I loved everything about this product, but it seems to be acting up with my iphone 4.

I use it in my home office to make calls and seldom have any problems (at least that aren't operator error!) I also use it for music and to listen to iPhone messages, books, videos, and other sounds without imposing my sounds on those around me.  After several months of heavy use I did have a plastic piece for the left button break which was likely more my fault than the device.  I contacted Plantronics' Quick Web service and they 2nd day FedEx'ed a warranty replacement with no further questions.  My only cost is to ship back the broken one.  Quick and simple process.Only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that the silicon ear pieces do not fit quite as well as I would like and tend to slip out if active when using them requiring reinserting them too often.  Providing options for different size ears would make this a five star product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001TK3AC0" id="B001TK3AC0-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-03-16:</strong> I've had 2.

After less than a month, it's started malfunctioning. It will randomly (and repeatedly) activate phone functions such as redial or voice control. When this happens, it becomes impossible to turn the headset off. Eventually it goes back to normal, but then it just starts malfunctioning again. Seems it can't handle a little sweat, which seems odd for a device that is made for sporty use.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001TK3AC0" id="B001TK3AC0-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-06-08:</strong> I bought the 906 version which is identical to the 903, but adds a bluetooth transmitter dongle for non-bluetooth devices.This is my 4th Plantronics bluetooth device and the 2nd that has been stereo BT. I will be taking this back after a day of use for these reasons:1) These are uncomfortable. I hate ear phones and love earbuds(or canal phones or In-Ear-Monitors). These seem to be somewhere in-between. After about 30 minutes my ears hurt. Granted, I've been using Sony earbuds for the last 8 years, so that's what I am comparing them to. I can wear my buds for 8+ hours with no discomfort, I've been wearing the Backbeats for 3.5 hours today and they've been uncomfortable throughout. You only get one size and I'd say I have average to small ear canals.2) These only sound alright. Again I'm coming from 8 years of the same $60 earbuds from Sony. These have a lot more treble and sound tinny to me. I had a much better experience with the older Plantronics 855 stereo bluetooth which used earbuds similar to the Sonys. I like more defined bass that gives rock and alternative music a punch. The Backbeats make music I am familiar with sound much less dynamic. I had to use the bass boost option on all music. I think most people will be fine with the sound, but more discerning listeners should look elsewhere. There is a feature called OpenMic which is supposed to allow you to hear the outside world better when you press a button. I had no problems hearing around me with this option turned on or off, one of the 2 settings just adds a low static hum.3) I made one phone call for 30 minutes while driving in my car with the windows up and after 5 minutes my friend told me to take them back because I was difficult to understand and my voice sounded "hollow". They were functional, but not transparent. On my end, I had no problems understanding my friend so no complaints receiving.On a positive note, all of the buttons on the Backbeat worked as expected with my HTC Incredible. I was able to pause, back track and forward track songs, adjust volume. Pairing was easy. I use Meridian music player on my Incredible and the Backbeat controls it well. If you go into the Meridian player's preferences you can turn off the headset controls and that will allow you to control Pandora, Last FM and Slacker. Slacker sounded terrible - it seemed to have a dramatic lack of bass which I've read is a known problem with Slacker when not using Wi-Fi.Battery life seems great. I've been listening to music and made 40 minutes of phone calls for the last 4 hours and the Backbeat battery indicator shows that it is still 1/3 to 2/3's full. I'm not willing to use these any longer due to ear discomfort.The over the ear design wasn't too bad when I had my thick Arnette sunglasses on. But add a baseball cap on top and you've got a problem. The cord behind the neck is solid, but as others have noted, if you want to lay with the back of your head against a pillow or headrest, it will significantly apply pressure to your ears and this really highlights how uncomfortable the Backbeat is to wear.The separate dongle that you get with the 906 model worked as expected. I had to go through the pairing process each time I switched between my Incredible and the dongle. I'm not sure if there is a better way, but it didn't seem automatic after the initial pairings.Bottom line, don't bother trying these out unless you can take them back for a full refund. They look good on, but if they don't fit you just right, I think you are going to be disappointed. I've also read that there may be some huge reliability issues with the Backbeat and they do not seem to hold up to sweat so you should probably avoid these at all costs.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001TK3AC0" id="B001TK3AC0-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-14:</strong> I've a had my now for a little less than a year.

I bought it and a Plantronics Voyager Pro at the same time.  The Plantronics Voyager Pro failed 1 year and 1 month later.  The folks at Plantronics basically said "tough, would you like to buy our latest model?"  They had no interest in the fact that I was dissatisfied, and had contacted them several times about the call clarity of the unit.  (They blamed it on my iPhone, even after I exchanged the phone for another one to resolve the issue.  Then they said it was an iOS issue that would be taken care of in an upgrade.  Then later said, too bad, your exchange time is up, live with it and hope "Apple" fixes the issue.  Turned out it wasn't an "Apple" issue.)  Since everyone I talked to regularly was complaining about the call clarity on their end of the call when I used the Voyager Pro, I decided to look on it as a chance to replace it with something from a different company.  (They also complained when I called from the airport on the Plantronics BackBeat 903, but I used it so seldom for a call it wasn't important, the stereo sound, without tangling wires, was nice on the plane and in the airport.)The Plantronics 903 BackBeat, purchased at the same time as the Voyager Pro, was purchased solely to use on airplane trips.  It has only about 80 hours of total use, and looks brand new...including "standby" time, it has only been turned on about 81-82 total hours in the last 3 years.  It has been stored in a special travel case...which I purchased for it, in my dresser drawer with some clothing.  I got it out yesterday to check it for pairing with my phone for a trip I intend to take next month.  It did exactly the same as the Voyager Pro when it died; worked for a few minutes, fluttered, quit, and refused to re-charge or turn back on.  I had bought Plantronics products because I have an 8 year old Plantronics bluetooth headset (that I still use as a backup)....it still works fine and nobody complains about the call clarity when I need to use it.  The quality of their older models was excellent, both in use and longevity...you really got your money's worth from their earlier products.  (I bought a Jawbone Era to replace the Voyager Pro, and everyone has always been very happy with the call clarity...it is two years old now, so I recently bought a Bose bluetooth headset, and again...everyone is happy with the call clarity.)My point being, that something seems to have happened with Plantroics manufacturing quality a few years ago.  Their older bluetooth headsets were well made, reliable, had good range, good battery time, and the call clarity was wonderful.  The products I bought 3 years ago, including the Plantronics 903 BackBeat just turned out to be a big waste of money.  Unless Plantronics has revisited their "roots" and begun making quality products again, knowing what I do now, I certainly wouldn't consider this headset.  The 903 BackBeat would not have held up to someone using it for jogging or exercise...it didn't hold up, even for occasional use while traveling on an airplane.  Anyone considering this headset should take a look at other products.  I'm not sure Plantronic's newer stereo headset model is better, but I don't think I will risk it.I'll either used a wired headset when listening to stereo music, or enjoy the sound in only one ear from the new Bose headset I bought....it really is fantastic how rich the Bose sound is when playing music...even though it is only in one ear.  I really hope they come out with a stereo bluetooth dual ear model.  After my past experience with Plantronics poor customer service, I'm sure a call to them about a hardly used, 3 year old, 903 BackBeat would be another futile waste of time.  I really don't expect my electronics to last more than a couple of years with constant use.  But, anyone should expect more than around 80 hours of use time from a product they spend, $99.99 for....the price was still on the box from the "Apple Store.")  If I decide to buy another bluetooth stereo headset, it will be some brand other than Plantronics.  I'm glad I read the reviews and didn't buy their latest single ear headset when I bought the Bose instead last month.  Stick with Jawbone and Bose, you will be happy.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001TK3AC0" id="B001TK3AC0-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-11-05:</strong> I bought this headset to replace my beloved BlueFox 401s.  I like to listen to audiobooks during my long commute.  If I have a lot of telephone calls, a full charge is not enough to last all the way home in the evening.  The issue with the BlueFox is that there is no iGO tip available, so I can't charge them at work unless I carry around the wall charger.  The BackBeats charge with a standard micro USB tip (A97).  They fit on my head much the same as the 401s except that the flexible ear pieces fit a little more comfortably. The controls work very well with my Droid Eris, while only some of the 401 controls worked properly.  I love the behind-the-head style headset because my hair hides the headset so nobody can see it.  The behind-the-head part on the BackBeat is flexible.This headset is multi-point, you can pair to more than one device at a time.If you are trying to decide between the BackBeat 903 and the 906, the only difference is that the 906 comes with a bluetooth adapter for devices that don't support bluetooth.  If you are using a mobile phone the 903 will work.UPDATE August 18, 2011:  Although I really liked this headset, after less than a year of use it stopped working.  The volume suddenly dropped so low that I couldn't hear.  It happened while I was listening to a recorded book from my iPad.  No amount of messing around with the controls or resetting helped.  I ordered the Motorola S10 as a replacement.  I dropped my review to 2 stars because I think a headset should last longer, especially since I was not a heavy user - only one or two days a week.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001TK3AC0" id="B001TK3AC0-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-06-29:</strong> The wire in back will chafe your neck and grip your shirt collars, the buttons are not ideally placed, the FF/REW/VOL switch is cool but slow to operate, and they're inconvenient to charge.

The Altec Lansing Backbeat sound quality was good when it came to music. However, sometimes when I was receiving calls the caller couldn't hear me & vice versa.  When the call did work and came through the caller complained of excessive background noise.  But the main problem I had was the fact it didn't want to stay snugly on my head...in my ears. I am a female with, what I'd like to believe, an average size head, but at times one side would come out of 1 ear and I'd have the worse time trying to get it coiled back around my ear to stay.  While finally getting the one side fixed, the other would come off.  Very annoying. It could have just been me, but it shouldn't be that difficult.Over all, it connected to my phone (EnV Touch) very easily & kept the connection in spite of where I was at or what I was doing.

Yet, it was still really good that i got a second one later on! The sound is really great, the fit is good and i have average ears, stays still while walking or running. The wireless experience with really good sound was, and still is, amazing for me, i even bought a bluetooth adapter for my ipod so i wont use all my phone's battery. BUT,this headphone has other bad sides that u need to consider, if u can live with them..like i did..u got urself a gr8 deal!First that wire at the back of ur head won't allow u to wear this with high collar clothes!it is flexible yet still longer than it should be, my neck is smaller than average so this may be the reason, in all cases they should have made it adjustable, coz it will annoy you while sitting or laying on ur back.. I have two of these, one refurbished & one new.. Like many reviewers here, the refurb. had many connection problems..some may think the headphone broke, but it didn't! I was about to return it but decided to call Plantronics first to ask about it..it turned out to be just that it needed a reset ( never happened to the new one yet though, its connection is smooth & easy!) To reset it, u have to hold the power key while plugging the charger in, the light will turn on and u can connect it normally to ur phone afterward! just make sure u turn off the headphone first before unpairing...for all this hassle it takes 3 stars(yeah not 2 nor 1) if the connection issue is solved and the back wire became adjustable this babe could easily get a 5 out of 5.*edit* The refurb one probably didn't have a very powerful connection, but this helped when there was many bluetooth devices in the area..! I found that the new one tends to be a little bit more intermittent & the music breaks more often due to the very strong connection that keep looking for bluetooth devices even when paired and the music is on! However if u are in a big gym, where people aren't working out all the time around u it won't be a very big deal..</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001TK3AC0" id="B001TK3AC0-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-15:</strong> I'm so mad I can't see straight!!  So keep that in mind as you read this review.  Because I won't bother repeating all the praises the 1 star reviewers have given it.  It's all true.  They're usually awesome.  Sound quality is great, battery life is long - and it doesn't take long to charge them up.But with that said - there is one thing that is so HUGELY ANNOYING it prompted me to write this review - so I could vent.  When the battery gets low - this ANNOYINGLY LOUD VOICE comes on saying "BATTERY IS LOW"!  And they've designed is to the volume of whatever you're listening to is cut to about 20% and the volume of this announcement is 80%.  SO ANNOYING I can't even tell you!You're on the phone, you have 2 hours of charge left - and this stupid announcement starts going off every couple of minutes.  Every time it goes off - you can't hear a word the person you're talking to is saying.So let's say you're doing a job interview or talking to a prospective client over the phone.  This person starts telling you what they're looking for and you really want to hear this because it has everything to do with whether or not you'll get the job.  And right when they get to the most critical thing - suddenly their voice volume is cut to 20% and all you hear blaring over their voice is - "BATTERY CHARGE IS LOW!!!"It'll drive you nuts!The sad thing is - this is a huge flaw on an otherwise perfect pair of headphones.  And the sadder thing is - it's completely unnecessary.  There are so many other ways for them to indicate to you that the battery is low - non-intrusive ways.  Like they could have a low-volume beep.  Or they could have the voice say "LOW BATTERY" instead of "BATTERY IS LOW".  It saves one word and can be said quicker.  And they could have it so this announcement uses 20% of the volume while allow whatever you're listening to take up 80%.Anyway, I just had to post something about this because I was SCREAMING at my headphones a few minutes ago!  It just amazes me how giant companies that only hire the smartest people in the world can do such dumb idiotic things.UPDATE 1/21/2014:  I just got a new pair of these because the battery on the old pair pretty much died.  (It lasted about 7 months).  This new pair is much better on the low battery announcements.  Much less intrusive.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001TK3AC0" id="B001TK3AC0-review21" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-03-30:</strong> This headset has good sound, not great, but audiophiles aren't going to go bluetooth anyway. this product is great for an office environment where you don't want to disturb others.

In car they are especially useful, and then while exercising or going about the house and being able to use phone or MP3 player. The advantage of stereo Bluetooth headphones is that you can use them for music and phone both, not to say the good sound quality. After usingPlantronics Pulsar 590 590A Ultimate Stereo Sound Innovation Bluetooth Headsetfor almost 4 years I wanted something low profile that is easy to use while exercising. Here is what I found about these BackBeat headphones.PROS1. Low profile and and nice design.2. The accompanying users guide does not really explain how to place these headsets. But they just sit over the ears, outside the canal, and you do not insert the silicone ear buds inside the ear. Once you place them, these are very comfortable in upright position. But finding the right location for ear buds takes some time and fiddling around in both axes, verical as well as rotation. It took me a while to find that and I wish company had explained in literature or had a video demo on their web site.3. Easy to pair.4. Good, clear voice quality and noise suppression.5. Good quality music sound in entire frequency range.6. Ubiquitous Micro-usb charger.7.. Pleasant audible tones let you know when there is a new call or when the unit is turned on and off.CONS1. Bluetooth connection keeps disconnecting. For example you use in one phone call and and for the next call the headphones are not working.  For me, this was the biggest drawback which made me return these headphones.2. Although they say you can connect two devices simultaneously, in practice it does not work well. To give you the example, say you are listening music on iPod Touch, you get a phone call, and when you hang up the iPod Touch is disconnected.3. Short range, the sound quality drops after about 9-10 feet and Bluetooth disconnects after about 20 feet.4. Accidentally pressing the Call and Play/pause buttons while adjusting the headphones in ear is very easy and happens all the time. But volume button nicely placed and works well.5. Track forward and back does not work with iPod Touch.6. Microphone does not work on iPod Touch.7. Does not work for music on Palm Centro, only the phone part.8. On Macs, you pair it as headsets and it will work well for a while. Then mysteriously the Bluetooth audio profile changes to Headphones and Headsets and it will stop working in either profile. If you pair as Headphones, the microphone does not work.9. While it is comfortable in upright position, you cannot use in lying down position because the back cord is thick, moves, and the headphones come out off the ears. Same while exercising on treadmill, keeps coming off the ear.10. Poor battery life, about 4-5 hours use. You have to charge them for 3 hours to be able to use them for 4 hours!11. No indicator light to let you know when it is on. Blue lights comes on for a second when you first turn it on and then goes off.There are a lot of nice things about these headphones but they need to improve the software so it does not disconnect, thin the back connecting cord, explain how to place the headphones in or over the ear, and make that telescoping and rotating mechanism a little sturdy so it holds in the same position. Since thePlantronics Pulsar 590 590A Ultimate Stereo Sound Innovation Bluetooth Headsetrarely disconnected, the repeated disconnection was really the clincher for me, which made me return these headphones and replace them with New Samsung WEP870 Mono + Stereo BT Headset which I found on sale at Verizon Wireless web site, lot cheaper than here.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001TK3AC0" id="B001TK3AC0-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-07-07:</strong> Altec Lansing 903/R US BackBeat Headphone is a very good wireless headset, both for phone/talk and music.

Bass is strong (with bass boost feature)4. Great battery life (6+ hours talk/music time)5. New OpenMic technology is very useful (so you don't have to take off the headset if you want to hear the surrounding)6. Quick switch from listening to music to picking up the phone7. Headset have dedicated button for remote control phone/music operation (like volume, bass, play, pause, switch to phone, mute, open mic control)Cons:1. Sound not as crisp as wired headphone (when listening to music), but very close, and for wireless, I think it's good enough2. Volume control is one level change per click (can't just hold the volume up or down to change the volume multiple level)3. Buttons are very small and it's not very easy/comfortable to press when you are wearing the headphone4. Have to press and hold the small button for 2 seconds to turn on or off (both headset and bluetooth adapter)5. It takes 3 hours to fully charge (1 hour charge will be nice)All in all, while this is not a perfect product, it is very good wireless product. And listening to music in wireless with a decent sound quality, priceless!If your music/mp3 players doesn't have bluetooth capability and you want to listen to it in wireless, you can check the Altec lansing 906/R BackBeat Headphones where a bluetooth adapter is included.Sidarta Tanu</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001TK3AC0" id="B001TK3AC0-review28" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-01-16:</strong> PROS:* Sound quality is good with music and phone calls.* Portability.* Compact design.* Holds a charge quite well.* Adjustments can accommodate ear sizes.* Lightweight.CONS:* They are not a quick-draw when taking them out for use.

Motorola was not satisfied with my receipt and would not replace them, so I decided to look at other options.  I own a Plantronics blue tooth headset for use with my phone when I drive, and like their product AND service.The reason I wanted a blue tooth headset was for my workouts at the gym.  I really like the flexible wire that connects both sides together, unlike the Motorola set that had a rigid connection that also put the bulk of the unit behind your neck ... not good when doing exercises where you lie on your back.The unit connects to my iPhone simply by turning them on!  Press the button in the right ear piece and the music starts to play.  It's very easy.The only drawback I see is that they appear not to do well with sweat.  I had one side stop working, but after 24 hours they were back to normal.  I now swap to a normal wired set of earbuds when I do my cardio workout to keep the sweat out of these.  This is not a big deal as the wire does not get in the way during my cardio workout, only my weight lifting workout.Also, it takes a little practice getting these on your ears ... at least for me it did.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001TK3AC0" id="B001TK3AC0-review30" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-08-13:</strong> Like several other reviewers, I've had the power button problem. I'm sending back my second set as I write this,but I still want this headset because I don't think there is anything better that has the same features (luckily I have a backup headset to use during the BB903 downtime). The user controls are excellent. The microphone performance is better than any other bt 'stereo' headset I've used in noisy environments (I've used in the past sony ericson and itech), but the noise reduction still is not good enough to have a normal voice volume conversation when in a moderate street noise environment. This headset is great for stereo listening in background noise levels up to a moderate street noise environment. The user controls permit the user to easily control the headset with minimal distraction and time. Transitioning from headset listening, to a face-to-face conversation (where you can clearly hear every word they are speaking) with someone is simple, and takes a fraction of a second to touch the headset controls. They are great to wear while driving if one is expecting a phone call during driving.

There are 4 points on this device if one of the 4 is sub par you have a worthless piece of junk. That is exactly what we have here. 3 out of the 4 parts are good. 1 is very bad.  Here they are:  1. The suction mount..Very good, it seems solid it was difficult to pull it off the windshield. Good long lasting material. 2. The tightener for the adjustable arm..also very good. When tightened down its not going to move.. 3. The green sticky adhesive ..this is what I thought the weak point would be if there was one. Not the case. The adhesive is very strong , it holds a droid razr maxx with no problem..Took some effort to pull it off.  4. This is what makes it useless. the arm attaches to the phone holder using one of those ball in socket joints..like garmin gps mounts. It just kind of flops around in its socket like the ball is too small for the socket. there is no way to tighten this up at all. So there is no way to position your phone or gps . It will stay where you want it for a second but if you were using this in a vehicle for example it would just droop straight down from basic driving vibrations.

It is a little hard to pull off the phone, cannot do while driving (thus 4 stars), but I grip the phone tightly, thumb one side and fingers on the other and hold the Grip Go with the other hand and peel it off. This works for me. I have tried probably 6-7 different phone/gps holders and this is the easiest to use and most reliable so far, except for the Garmin GPS clip-in one, but I dont take it on and off the holder.  Summer heat is the real test of the suction cup. That usually ruins them. The other problem with others I have used is they have sliding arms that have to be spread to put the phone on it, and adjusted, so putting it on one-handed while driving is not possible. Those arms also break easily. With GripGo I just stick it on with one hand. I like the length of the GripGo arm also as it reaches from windshield to within easy reach while driving to see and change a song on the iphone. I went on and bought another GripGo for my backup camera monitor.

(You know the kind.  Where you get the second unit for "free" with separate shipping and handling.  Always a big mistake). He didn't like it, but figured he would let me try it in hopes that he may be able to recover some of his highway robbery shipping charges.  I have to admit that I wanted this thing to work. It would be nice to be able to attach close by and have it be available at a convenient angle.  And I will also admit that I was pleasantly surprised early on when the suction thingy worked very well in attaching itself nicely to the windshield.  Unfortunately that is where the luxury of this thing ended its impressiveness with me.  First of all the other reviewers here that talked about having to remove any rubber like case on your phone are correct.  They don't of course mention it in the commercials, but they do on the product instructions.  The surface of the Grip Go requires a hard surface to stick to, or work.  But in reality, it doesn't.  Work that is.  My phone, with the case removed and all kosher and everything fell off within 10 minutes the first time I used it, and continued to thereafter at regular and shorter intervals.  It fell off going over bumps, when reaching for it, and sometimes when it just took a notion too all on its own. Every time.  Very aggravating, and a total and complete waste of money.  Needless to say my friend was out a sale, and hopefully so will this seller when it comes to you.

I bought this at the store and it was on sales so got it for $5. I have to say that I know suction cups don't do well in the cold especially if you don't clean the window. That is a given on all suction cup window mounts. I used it on the window of my car for months and had a few times it came off due to cold weather. I have never had the phone come off the green sticky pad. I kept the little perfectly fitted plastic cover that was on the green sticky pad and put it back on to keep it cleaned. I find that when it needs to be cleaned I bring it into the bathroom at work so I can use the hand dryer to dry it off. Works well every time. I have a new car now and it doesn't really work for me on the windshield so I used that round plastic adhesive disk that came with it to attach to my dash. Works great still.

The mounting its self also was very comparable.  The HUGE fail was the sticky part that actually holds your device to the mount.  Right out of the box it was already falling half way off the mount and I hadn't even used it at all.  I removed the plastic piece that projected the sticky part then placed my device onto it.

Since it isn't on a boom it is omni-directional.  Often this lead to callers hearing my colleagues more than me, and issue with our phone software modifying volume levels automatically because it thought I was speaking.

I have used it many times and have enjoyed it very much.  I also purchsed the Sony HWSBTA2W Bluetooth wiresless audio transmitter/reciever at the same time.  I installed the transmitter/receiver at the output of my stereo surround sound system so I can watch a late night movie without disturbing others in the household. It works great. There is no delay between the actors speaking and my hearing the words, which was one complaint/review I read before I purchased the headset, and this true for both DVDs and DirecTV movies as well, no delay at all. The range is great, about 30 feet unobstructed, less if there is a sheetrock wall. In my home I also have a wireless computer router and portable telephone in the 2.4 Ghz frequency range and so far have experienced no interference at all.

Latency is generally more a factor of processor at the sound source than technology in the headphones.Usability: 3 stars.Actually, everything's fine until one gets to The "Jog" Button which has multiple flaws.1. it's too sensative and wiggles too easily. To Pause/Stop a track, it requires great concentration to feel one's way around to find this button and then manage to press straight down without moving one way or the other and thus skipping or repeating the track instead of pausing it.2. it's too close to the volume buttons. After several days of mild frustration, I've learned to slo_o_o_o_owly slide my finger up from the very bottom until I find the volume buttons. Then I slo_o_o_o_owly find the correct one to adjust up or down. Otherwise, I'm again faced with skipping to the next track every time I want to adjust the volume. This is especially unpleasant when watching Streaming movies as it generally stops the movie and forces the user to start over from the beginning and then scan to find where they were before their tragic decision to adjust the volume.This control should be moved far from other buttons. Better yet, the manufacturer could spend the extra few pennies on wire and put this control on the left earpiece where it can't be hit by accident. Of course, over there, maybe it wouldn't have to be a blasted multi-dysfunction "jog" button because there would be room to separate the functions to avoid unpredictable results.Overall, I love these headphones.

I bought a cheaper model from Sony earlier, but really wanted to experience the best bluetooth headphones Sony makes.  So far, I really don't have any complaints.

Blocks out a lot of noise naturally and can even use them while mowing the grass without cranking the volume all the way up to hear it over the mower.  Range varies depending on whether you're using it to talk on the phone or listening to music; I get a good 20 feet for music (little or no obstructions) and about 30 feet using for phone (couple of rooms away) for telephone.For me, I've found the perfect pair of wireless headphones.

Being a hater of wires, I went looking for wireless headphones, and kept finding that the ones that rate well for audio quality tend to be ridiculously expensive.  I ran across these on Amazon, and decided to give them a whirl, even though they seemed too cheap (as in inexpensive, not poor quality) to be any good.I'm extremely glad I took the chance!  They have great sound, good volume, and great battery life.  I only have to charge them once a week (I listen probably only a couple hours a day, and not every day, so take that for what it's worth), which is great.  They also do a good job of isolating you from the outside world, and likewise, do a good job of keeping your tunes from bothering other people.If I had to pick out any issues with them, I'd say that they could stand to allow for bigger heads - I have them extended out as much as they will go, and they JUST fit.  I guess I am one with a big head :).The only other issue I could pick out is that the on-board controls are a little hard to pick out while wearing them - they are small, somewhat flush, and close together.  Still, I've gotten pretty adept at controlling my music with them.I have not tried them for phone calls - I tend to like to use the phone directly while at work, so I can't say how well the microphone performs.Overall, I'd say these are a great find, especially when you consider how expensive wireless headphones tend to be.

You can now change volume for the headphones using the onscreen volume sliders (previously the volume bar changed to say "DRBT50" and you had to control it using the headphone controls). You also have the option to output sound to either the headphones or ipad speakers (a new toggle icon appears when the headphones are on) which is nicer than having to turn them off completely to use the ipad speakers. You can also go to next/previous song using the built-in controls. You still need to press the play/pause button for them to connect, unfortunately (other bluetooth devices connect instantly when turned on).Unfortunately, this comes with a huge downside.. videos default to playing audio through the ipad speakers. If you listen to music through the headphones and a music video comes up, the sound will come out of the ipad (you need to go into the controls and change it every time one comes up!) Even worse, other sounds such as those from games also default to the iPad speakers.. but have no option to output to the headphones (which previously worked perfectly). The downsides far outweigh the positive additions in this case, and it's something that needs to be fixed.Original review:I picked up the DRBT50 headphones for my iPad, mainly for peace of mind. I like listening to music on my iPad, but find my headphone cord always ending up in the wrong spot - getting stuck in my chair or wrapped around something. I get that "If I had just rolled my chair out, the iPad would've gone crashing down" feeling. Whether it's with short cords or long ones (long cords have the problem of being too long!). I wanted a wireless option that had great sound but didn't break the bank.The DRBT50 has been the closest to that, that I've found.Pairing is rather quick  (but you will need to read the manual on how to do it). Unfortunately the iPad doesn't automatically connect to it - this means that you not only need to turn the headphones on, but connect them in the Settings -> Bluetooth option. Annoying if you walk out of range or connect/disconnect the headphones all day. (UPDATE: I found that hitting the Play/Pause button on the headphones will connect it to the iPad without having to go into the options!)Battery life is very good and a charger is included - unfortunately it's an AC Adapter unlike the mini-USB port that most use.The headphones are very stylish and fold up very nicely (a big problem with the other headphones).The controls on the side are a nice idea, but more trouble than they're worth (at least to me). They're small buttons and I always find myself hitting the wrong one. Most of them will NOT work on the iPhone/iPod/iPad (only the VOL+, VOL- and Play/Pause buttons work). No big loss since the controls are so hard to find (they're behind the ear). (UPDATE: The buttons have gotten easier to find after further use - still not the easist, but definitely do-able (especially for volume)When paired with the iPad, it "takes control" of the volume (so you need to use the iPad to change the volume). See the product image I've attached to the item page.Sound is very good - I've heard complaints that it doesn't block out noise as good as it should (while I don't use it in the loudest places, I found it to block out most noises - not "noise cancelling" though). Bass could be better, but overall not bad. Not up to par with mySennheiser HD-595 Premier Headphone, but it's also a third of the price and bluetooth.I would have liked a headphone input jack for those times you want to use it with a non-bluetooth device (like a home theater).I havent used it as a headset yet, but heard it does a decent job.Overall a very good product and possibly the best bluetooth headphones available in this price range. If you need something compact and high quality, and can deal with some of its oddities like the button placement, need for AC adapter and pairing issues, it's a great little addition!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000PCCLPU" id="B000PCCLPU-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2008-02-06:</strong> It's really hard to describe how good it sounds.  I've been impressing all my friends with it's audio quality; regardless of it being wireless or not.  I can heard subtle details in the songs that I didn't know existed; just like studio monitor headphones.  In fact, they are so clear, I can easily tell the difference between standard mp3 compression sound quality and audio CDs.  I've been using these headphones for days and hours at a time; and, it just doesnt run out of battery power.  It also does a great job of cutting out noise that you dont want to hear in the same room.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000PCCLPU" id="B000PCCLPU-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-23:</strong> This blue tooth head set saved my day I can watch my movies on my Ipad when I am at the gym and listen to them on the headset with out wires dangling in my  way at my knees an awesome product I really like them.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000PCCLPU" id="B000PCCLPU-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-08-02:</strong> Sony does it again.

The body is an aluminum tube about one inch longer than the typical 'super cheap' stylus that sells for a fraction of the price. The extra length and the extra weight makes the stylus significantly more comfortable to hold. It has a 'normal' rubber tip and it worked well with the several phones and tablets I tested it. It's a good tool and quite durable. The tether option - you plug it into your phone or tablet earphone jack - is interesting but a little risky in my view as the stylus may swing and possibly strike your tablet or your phone by accident and, short as it is, you must unplug it if you are going to actually use the stylus.It also appears to be mass-produced, big time. If you are at the Amazon's product page and scroll down to the "Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought" section you are likely to find what appears to be the exact same stylus offered by about a dozen other vendors, each stamping their own 'brand' and some offering interesting color options. Price appears to be in the same ballpark for all so the decision on which one to buy comes down probably to shipping charges and maybe 'color'.I must disclose that YooMee sent me this at no charge, hoping for a review. I didn't promise a good review in exchange but this, as mass produced and unoriginal as it is, happens to be a good stylus which probably explains why everyone is selling it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007T3ZZAQ" id="B007T3ZZAQ-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-02:</strong> I like it, good quality, sleek stylish look, and works very well on my Nexus 7.

I have purchased 5 different ones. So far this is my favorite. Length and weight are just right . I like that the tip is made more like a real pen. Not the same width at the cylinder.  It has only been a week, so I wil have to see how the rubber tip holds up. The attachment to the headphone jack works great. But my case has a stylus holder, so I rarely use that feature. I did test it out though.  With the low price, I am going to order a few more and leave them around as spares. My comparisons have all been $12 and under. So I have yet to use a pricey one for comparison.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007T3ZZAQ" id="B007T3ZZAQ-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-07:</strong> This is a lightweight capacitive stylus for touch screen devices. Also included is a removable tether that clips into the headphone jack of your device. I'd advise caution with using the clip because it seems like it's made of very brittle plastic and will probably break in short order.This stylus worked well for me. It uses a rubber tip that is quite squishy so a light touch is preferable or you could actually cause the tip to tear if you were to continually press and drag it with too much force.I use this stylus on several devices including a Nexus 7 table and an iPad. It works well on all the devices I've used it with.The metal clip on the stylus is handy for attaching the stylus to a folder, or to give added grip if your stylus is in a stylus loop on a cover when no in use.The tip does not come apart so there does not seem to be any possibility that the tip can be replaced if it were to eventually rip. It would basically be a throw-away at that point.I was provided a sample for review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007T3ZZAQ" id="B007T3ZZAQ-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-13:</strong> I purchase this stylus, mostly because of the price, but upon recieving it.. i learned that it was way more then just the price!

We play words with friends with the stylus and it doesnt make everything "thick" like other stylus. Honestly for the price, why not try it out? you wont be dissapointed, what so ever. The option to put it in the headphones area for storage is also a great option! i do plan on purchasing more in the future.

There is no wiggle room or worrying about the phone slipping out of the case. The case adds very little weight or girth to the phone while giving it some grip so it won't easily slip out of your hand. Also, the holes and recesses all align perfectly.SHIPPING/TRANSIT TIME: I ordered this using Amazon Prime and received this the next day with free shipping.PRICE: This product is a bit more pricey than other TPU case in the same genre. Also, like others in this genre, there is no cover over the power button which loses it some major points especially for the HTC One. More on the power button cut-out later.QUALITY: This is a category  which is most important to me. However, I rate it differently. Since this is product sold on Amazon, I am running on the assumption that buyers (like me) research and read reviews on products before making a purchase. So when I rate the quality, I am comparing it to others in the same genre (TPU/TPU Hybrid Cases). This went from 4 to 2 stars all because of one thing, literal quality. That is, did I get what I paid for in the condition I expected. The answer is NO. Once I received the package, I opened it to find that the clear see through part was scuffed and scratched and the Supcase logo overlapped the Verizon logo on my phone. I waited to post a review until giving their customer service ample time to respond and send a replacement. They did not do this. Over a week has gone by without any response on the defectiveness at all. I am okay with getting a defective product. After all, it is mass produced in a factory somewhere, and shipped across the globe. Something is sure to become damaged along the way. What I am NOT okay with is the being ignored. I fully expect sellers to stand behind their products. This is the greatest mark of a company's integrity and quality. This mark was sorely missed from my perspective.EASE OF USE: One major hold up is the power button cut-out. The power button itself on the HTC One is already almost completely flush with the phone and the cut-out adds to the difficulty in getting to it. Don't get me wrong, it isn't rocket science, but it just isn't as accessible. However, I must say, that unlike others in this genre, the cut out for the power button tapers down a bit, so it is a bit easier to reach than other cut out TPU types.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------FINAL REMARKS: I purchased this product after looking extensively for something like the Neo Hybrid I have for the Galaxy Note 3, so I perhaps came into this with higher hopes to begin with. There is nothing like the Neo Hybrid for the HTC One, but I liked the look of this product. This product would have a nice look if not for the scratches, and I will not be using mine simply due to the scuffing on the inside. Now in knowing the quality of their customer service, I will personally be excluding this maker in future searches for my accessory needs.Update: June, 6 2014I am posting a follow-up and have also downgraded the score. To date, customer service has not responded to my initial complaint regarding the defectiveness. I have also tried to follow-up with them. I even looked up a phone number to call, and I was transferred 3 times and finally left a voice message. I called again and was placed on hold for 20 minutes!!! It is just a $9 case, but at this point it is a principle thing and that I want other buyers to know. Absolutely the worst customer service I have ever had.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C3H8WLW" id="B00C3H8WLW-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-26:</strong> This case is a normal to case however fits perfect and grip is perfect and every connection openings are made perfect.

It has openings in all the right places, and it holds the phone very well. I do find that the volume rocker is much harder to press, but I guess I'll get used to it. Also, I wished they made a cut out for the volume rocker so I can see the scratched-metal volume buttons. The trim (I ordered the black one to go with my silver HTC One) looks very nice and it contrasts well. Don't expect this case to save your phone from major drops, just maybe light drops from short heights.My biggest gripe with this case is how cheap the back is. Upon arrival of the case, it was already scratched near the camera cutout, and it's not a small scratch either. Thankfully it's hard to see with the phone in the case, so I got over that. The back also scuffs INCREDIBLY easy. Just putting the phone inside, it already scuffs the transparent backing of the case, which is very well visible. I also have these weird pencil-like markings where the white stripe of my HTC One should be on the case. I'm sure it was used during the manufacturing process, but it takes away from the design a lot. I also find that the back is very electro-static, which isn't good because it attracts all kinds of lint from my pockets.The only reason I bought the case was for the transparent backing so I can actually see how awesome the HTC One looks. However, the problem lies with the transparent backing, and it's very unfortunate. I wished Supcase used higher quality materials and raised the price of the case to adjust accordingly, but in the mean time, I'll be on the lookout for a similar case to replace this one.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C3H8WLW" id="B00C3H8WLW-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-31:</strong> I love, love, love this case! Probably my most favorite out of the three I own (one other [UAG] being for outside/active use while the other is collecting dust). I use this case everyday at home and it feels like I'm holding the bare phone. The clear back is what made me buy it: I don't have to hide the beauty that is the HTC One. I always disliked other cases because I couldn't see the back my phone (dumb reason? maybe!). After all, what drew me to the phone over the Galaxy S4 was the superior build quality and design. The contrasting black bumper around the clear back just makes this one real snazzy case. It is also very inexpensive, which is a plus...

If you want to carry your phone naked, this is the next best thing. The Supcase adds almost no weight or thickness and looks really nice. If you are not concerned with ever dropping the &#34;most difficult to repair phone ever made&#34; then this Supcase will serve you well.Until you drop it.This is a good case for the money, as cheap as it is I would have bought one no matter what simply based on how good it looks. I have a silver M7 and I got the clear back with black sides. Everyone that sees it raves about how cool it looks. The black sides blend in perfectly with the black screen and the only silver showing is the speaker grilles, highlighting the industry leading Beats Audio stereo speakers.The clear back is a scratch magnet.The overall feel of the case is slick, but not as slick as carrying the HTC One M7 naked. Mine feels like a wet bar of soap without a case. The first time I got out of  my car with my phone in this Supcase, the phone slipped out of my pocket. I have carried many different phone models in the exact same pocket and this is the first time that has ever happened. I am very glad I was parked on grass or there might have been much wailing and gnashing of teeth.All the pictures of this case that I have seen appear to show a matte finish to the colored sides. The black one I received has a piano gloss finish. It's not that it looks bad or adversely affects the function or feel of the case, but it is not what I expected based on the pictures. The entire case including the clear back has a slick high gloss finish. This is what I expected for the back, but based on other reviews and the manufacturers description I anticipated more grip on the sides. Perhaps with wear, after the gloss has dulled it may feel different. Brand new it is slicker than what I want.The Supcase has a raised lip around the front glass so that the screen will  not touch a flat surface if the phone is laid face down.The ports are well aligned and spacious enough for fat aftermarket charger and headphone plugs.The I/R blaster on the power button is wide open.The volume buttons require much more effort to press with the Supcase on. Depending on your perspective, this may be good or bad. I found myself pressing them a lot when I didn't want to with a previous hybrid case, and also with the phone bare. So in my opinion it is an advantage but if you work your volume buttons more often you may not like it.Overall, this is a well designed case that looks really good, but I am not confident about the drop protection it offers.Good for date night or dressing up to go to church, not so good if there is any chance you might drop it on a hard surface.I plan to buy an Urban Armour Gear case for daily use. I like its Industrial look, and I didn't really buy the One to look at, I bought it to use. Looks are just a nice perk. I will keep this Supcase around when I want to show it off.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C3H8WLW" id="B00C3H8WLW-review26" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-10:</strong> The best case I have had for my HTC One.

Therefore after a week it becomes frosty in appearance and the texture of the clear back is then slightly chalkboardy rather than smooth and tacky which I prefer. All in all it is what it is and I can't find anything really like it so I can keeping it but it shows that no one took this model on a test drive before they sold it.

I have dropped the phone multiple times and the case has done its job every time. Normal ware and tare will show scratches on the clear plastic thus making the case less transparent. To avoid this, you may want to invest in a ZAGG invisishield product or the like.The non-plastic edge started separating from the plastic after 6 or so months of use. Two months after that, I needed a new one. I must say that the only reason one would take the case of is to clean the phone (and case).

Clear hard plastic in the back.Two issues.The buttons on the case have almost zero movement feel to them.  Pressing the buttons through the edge of the case requires a lot of force or to hit the tiny sweet spot.  I think this will keep me from using this case.The microphone hole in the bottom isn't quite aligned and there is plastic flashing surrounding it, so the hole isn't completely open.  I'm not sure why they didn't put a larger hole there.  The mic hole they put on the back of the case is gigantic in comparison.On the positive side, the IR does work through the covered hole.  I'm quite sure this case would protect the phone from 80-90% of the drops and look good doing it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C3H8WLW" id="B00C3H8WLW-review41" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-08:</strong> Just got the case moments ago and at first I was thinking this might just be the right case.  Got it on my phone and so far nice and snug.  Checked around the edges to make sure it was in good and got to the bottom where the mini usb port is and there is where the love affaire died.  It is not just loose in that area - it actually sags down some and if you touch the area you can very clearly feel the plastic push in.It would be a simple fix I think with some type of adhesive, but obviously I'm not going to chance wrecking my phone by putting a small dab of goop on igt.  Darn!  I so want a good case!  Going to give it a day or so and see if I can get used to it.  If they only used a little thicker or more plastic in that area it would make it more rigid and avoid this altogether.  Oh well.Other areas I read about and my take on them.Power button is sensitive for sure, but for me I am not quite convinced that it is going to be a problem.  Have not tested the IR power button, but enough of the other reviews say it works so I am sure it does.Volume buttons do take some purposeful force to get them to respond, but for me I have widgets that let me control my volume so I'm not that worried about it.The little mic hold next to the USB charge ports is good enough.  It is a small hole, but it is not so small that sound won't make it in.  Even if it was this would be a simple fix.  Just get an oversized needle and make the hole a little bigger.  Problem solved.Overall I'm having a really hard time with the loose fit around the charge port and I hope it not a portal for dust and debris.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C3H8WLW" id="B00C3H8WLW-review42" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-27:</strong> I have the HTC One in red and absolutely had to show off the color so I desperately needed a clear case.

Incoming sound is good.  Unfortunately, the outgoing sound is a deal breaker.  If there is any background noise, this headset will pick it up and transmit it just as loud as your voice.  The DSP helps a little, but affects the sound quality dramatically (think overcompressed MP3).  I am an attorney and need to talk to clients; I need to sound professional.  Unfortunately, this $100 headset does not match the sound quality of a $25 wired headset with a boom mic.  I am trying to modify mine by rewiring it with a boom mic from an [...] headset, but so far I have not gotten it to work.  I am willing, though, to risk destroying the JX10 in order to have a chance at better outgoing sound.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000DLAMPO" id="B000DLAMPO-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2006-08-12:</strong> I tried a few BT headsets and it came down to the Nokia BH-800 and the Jabra JX10.  Both units have good audio quality.  I also liked that both units are small.  Thus, you don't look like you are on your way to a Star Trek convention while you are wearing them.While I liked the JX10's design over the BH-800, it had trouble understanding my voice commands.  I use Microsoft Voice Command with my XV6700 PocketPC phone.  I had to speak to the JX10 very slow and clearly to achieve only a 50% success rate in it understanding my commands the first try and subsequent tries.  The BH-800 understands my commands closer to 90% on the first try and 99% on the second try.The JX10 was comfortable in my ear without the earloop.  It never came close to falling out- it passed the head tilt test and the bend over test.  With the earloop, however, I could barely hear the unit.  The earloop prevents the unit from coming close enough to the ear.Pros:1. Good audio quality.  People can clearly hear me and I can clearly hear them.2. It's small.  It's less "geeky" than some headsets.3. Nice look and button layout.4. Charge cradle and USB charging is a nice bonus.Cons:1. I had to remove the ear loop so that I could get the unit close enough to my ear to hear it.2. I felt like I might break the unit when connecting and disconnecting it from the cradle.3. Did not work well with Microsoft Voice Command.  This was the show stopper and why I picked the Nokia BH-800 instead.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000DLAMPO" id="B000DLAMPO-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2007-06-03:</strong> So far, none of the Bluetooth headsets I have tried has surpassed or reached the sound levels and quality of my Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth set to which I always revert after trying a new model in my never ending quest for the perfect Bluetooth headset. Jabra JX10 has approached it a bit more than the other Jabra models me or my wife had (BT250, and BT500) and maybe it has a better fashionable design, ultra low weight and slick look, but its sound quality is still one class below Plantronics.PROS:- Extremely small and light- Can be charged from a PC with a micro USB cable- Among all the Jabra headsets I had (BT250 and BT500), JX10 has the best outgoing sound quality and level.  My conversation partners could hear me just fine (surprise, because I didn't believe into microphones being in my ear instead of close to my mouth).- It can supposedly be worn with or without the ear clip (hook).- Very nice, fashionable and sophisticated design for a graceful lady or a slower moving person (my sudden moves in the gym, car or with my little daughter sometimes knock this set out of my ear)CONS:- Incoming sound has a great deal of static unless the phone is very next to the set (it's so bad that when I decide to change the ear, I have to move the phone to the same side of the body)- Volume level is too low for city dwellers, unless I forcefully press it hard against and into my ear.- It doesn't fit well and stick inside my earlobe with or without the plastic hook:With the hook it sticks out a bit and doesn't fit into the ear as close,Without the hook it falls off too easily and too often (if you think the problem is in my ears, on one occasion a plastic surgeon chose me as an example to demonstrate that nobody's ears are perfect because I was physically closest to him, but then he changed his mind.)  I choose to wear it without the hook because it fits better into my ear but I'd never ride my bike or do any sudden movements without the hook.- It's so light that I don't feel it if it falls off- For the above reasons I definitely don't recommend it for sporty and fast moving individualsBottom line: Nice and fashionable set for people who don't move much and won't use it outside or in noisy areas.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000DLAMPO" id="B000DLAMPO-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2008-08-04:</strong> I've had a few bluetooth headsets over the past few years, and this is easily the best one I've used so far.The main talking points have already been covered to death, so I'm just going to give you a couple of reasons why I love it.First and foremost, it pairs to two devices.  Most headsets will only pair to one device, so if you want to switch between devices, you have to re-pair it every time.  In my case, I have the headset paired to both my Motorola Q and my Playstation 3. Whichever device I am using at the time, the headset will automatically connect to that device.The sound quality is excellent, and the range is far greater than any other headset I've used.So there it is.

I was told that I sounded like I'm talking....."in a tunnel" & "on a headset"So as you can tell the positives outweigh the negatives. It's a good headset but not for business use.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000DLAMPO" id="B000DLAMPO-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2006-01-28:</strong> I use to be the flagbearer for the Cardo Scala 500 and LogiTech Pro --- and while those headsets hold a special place in my heart, they'll never see the light of day anymore because of this great new headset from JabraThe JX10 is an EXCELLENT headset --- I'll list the pros and cons below -1. SOUND QUALITY OUTBOUND --- I called my own voicemail and talked into it, while wearing this headset --- not only did it sound great in my regular voice, but I could even hear myself whispering (yes, I tested that too) --- so don't believe those who say that people on the other end will not hear you --- outbound sound quality wise, its the best headset out there, as I heard no static, no drop-outs, and no tunnel effects2. SIZE --- easily, this is the most comfy headset out there --- it is optional to attach it to your ear, and wear it without the loop --- honestly, the loop holds it in place much better, with no discomfort one bit --- yes, you can wear it without the loop, and it will hold okay, but either way is fine --- the thing is TINY which is neat3. CALL PICK UP --- call pick up happens instaneous, with a half a second delay --- no manual initiation necessary4. BATTERY and CHARGER --- the battery seems to hold just fine all day --- and the charger is real small --- the package also includes a USB charger, so that you can charge it over USB on your computer, which I thought was pretty useful for people on the roadOther pros would be that the RANGE seems pretty solid, and PAIRING was easy (I liked that JABRA created a SEPERATE pairing button)I would consider VOLUME a pro --- it would be nice if it was louder --- however, I can hear everyone just fine, provided that I'm indoors (whether that be in the office, in the car, etc) --- it can hold its own outdoors, but if you use your headset a lot outside, then you may wanna test run the JX10 first --- I think the Cardo Scala 500 had the LOUDEST volume, and the JX10 comes very close to that loudnessCONS ---1. BUTTONS --- this is really a MINOR complaint --- I think the button placement (accepting calls, ending calls) could be a little better - but its not a big deal, and certainly, not a deal breaker --- the thing is so small, that its kinda hard to fit any buttons on it anywayshonestly --- can't think of any other consThe headset is definitely the best looking --- silver with black streaks!I love this headset, and its gonna be awhile until its unseatedyes, the price is steep, but its worth it --- take my word for itthank you for reading and HAPPY BUYING!!!!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B000DLAMPO', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B000DLAMPO', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00A8YWEJ8</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00A8YWEJ8</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

I like it very much. People think that my Galaxy Note II is trimmed in purple, but it's the screen saver. Additionally, the matte finish is glear-proof exception: sunlight. I can see very well and it is easy to clean. Initially, I was put-off because the instructions were not in English and the extra non-color screen saver could not be used because paper stuck to the glue. However, I did and am using the color-trimed screen saver. In the future, I plan on purchasing different colors to give my Galaxy Note II a different look. Also, I was not happy about how long it took to receive my item, which was about one and one-half to two weeks, but it was worth the wait!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00A8YWEJ8', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00A8YWEJ8', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B009EARUFU</h2>    <p class="price"> $B009EARUFU</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

I don't change it as often as I had anticipated, due to it being a fair amount of work.

Most recently on the Note 2 it has become a little more challenging because I wanted a case that would protect my phone but not add so much bulk that the already huge Note 2 got bigger.  This is the perfect case if you are in that category.  The case fits nice and snug, there is no extra room for the case to move around and it covers all around the phone so that you can put your phone screen down without anything hitting the screen.  The design on the back and sides give you that extra grip and overall is a solid design.  The glossy parts of the case do attract finger prints and smudges but they wipe off easily enough.  All the cut out of the phone are easily accessible and the case's covers for the volume rocker and power button do not restrict use at all.For the price of this case you can't ask for a better deal!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009PAWIZ6" id="B009PAWIZ6-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-30:</strong> This case for the Note 2 has to be the best value in an phone case on AMazon.

Considering I am prone to dropping my phone I knew I needed to get something on there right away.  I bought this hoping it was a hard plastic phone but it is more of a soft plastic.  Not like a gel case mind you but a flexible plastic.  Not entirely sure this will protect the phone from a large fall and I hope not to find out, but it should do for protection for now.  Feels good in the hand, very cheap price and I got it in four days.  I say get it until something better comes out.

The GN2 is a large phone, and I wanted something that would keep the back from scratching, provide a better grip on the device, and some shock protection in case of an accidental drop.  This case performs well for all of those needs.  The only gripe I can think of is that the shiny "X" in the middle is a fingerprint magnet, but it quickly cleans up with a microfiber cloth.  The cover is easy to remove and replace, yet stays on securely.  I'll be using this cover when I have the device in the car cradle (flip cover won't work), and my flip cover for most other situations and "formal occasions".  Can't go wrong with the low price on this product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009PAWIZ6" id="B009PAWIZ6-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-16:</strong> The price is right, it adds grip to the phone without adding much size, and it looks good.

I've had cases like this in past and when it arrived it was better than ever!  Very good quality and well made.I've show the case to lots of people; ie. like little kid, "pretending" that this is my new Note 2 phone.  Just to show the size and shape of this "phablet".  At first my friends laughed good humoredly at me, then they too enjoyed the pretending.

Another disappointed Amazon reviewer of the case mentioned above informed the DURA X as a good alternative in their review, so I gave the DURA X case a try. This is a very nice, attractive case that should protect the Note 2 well.  The only complaint I have is I wish it had that rubber matte soft feel.  This case has a much harder feel, and doesn't have the same easy grip that you get from the rubber matte finish style cases.  However at the end of the day I want a case that protects the $700 phone it houses, that is, and always will be priority one for the case in my book.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009PAWIZ6" id="B009PAWIZ6-review21" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-19:</strong> This is my everyday case.

I prefer this over the one with kick stand because it seems to offer more protection for the screen.  IMO, the lip that goes around the screen is substantially thick enough to feel that the screen will be well protected if dropped face down on even flat surface but definitely not on an uneven pavement.  It is well design not bulky like some others.  The material is thick enough to have a feeling that the phone will be well protected and can absorb the shock all around if dropped (no, I haven't been brave enough to perform the dropped test).The only draw back is the fitting is bit too loose in my taste.  Overall, I am very please with this exceptional case especially for the price and its quality.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B009PAWIZ6', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B009PAWIZ6', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00BQ0US14</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00BQ0US14</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

I really do. It is easy to use and lots of cool photo apps that have been taking my sweet time away. This phone did come unlocked and works with a t-mobile sim card. I did purchase this phone new but like most users here I received it used with minor scratches and sadly only came with the charger. I did however manage to get some sort of discount for this condition. Above all this phone is great for any shutterbug. The touch screen is sensitive-- more so than my iPad2!!Now for the cons: not a lot of apps, which is okay! I'm not much of an app user. The only apps I really use on the 920 are facebook, gmail, skydrive and instagraph.that being said the battery life is pretty poor. I was quite shocked after the 100% charge i had it before I slept but then in the morning it dropped to 89%. WOW. What happened? Apparently this is a major problem that Nokia/Microsoft haven't really (at least what I think) brought up. Google tips on how to increase the battery life.Note: this phone is heavier than you might actually expect. But with that aside I'm pretty happy with my purchase. If weight is an issue then wait for the 925.That's why I gave this 4/5 stars.---- Update 7/18/13Now I rate this 2/5 given that the battery life has been dropping more since I tried to increase it. The phone is a phone hog. I've turned off some apps, other items on the phone and put it on the not recommend battery saver mode, but the phone is still sucking up the battery like no other. I may have had a faulty phone... but my experience with it is pretty poor.Poor battery = slow loading time = unhappy customer. I returned this phone and am going to wait for the Nexus 5.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009ZC90P0" id="B009ZC90P0-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-20:</strong> I used to have a Nokia Lumia 900 and wanted to share some experiences between the two devices:pro:-camera and video is much better and the OIS works for video extremely well-SIM tray is not as flimsy-display being flush is a nicer feel-microUSB port has a trim which makes it more robust - my 900 got damaged from the cable after wear-camera bezel doesn't scratch after one daycon:-no built in radio in WP8 software-is heavier/chunkieroverall, I wouldn't say the 0.2" display increase is much larger, but with the home screen in WP8, does feel much more spacious.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009ZC90P0" id="B009ZC90P0-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-23:</strong> The Nokia Lumia 920 is an excellent phone, but there were a few problems along the way. Let me explain...I purchased a glossy red Nokia 920 on November 9th (Launch Day) at the local ATT store. Personally, I wanted to give the yellow version a try, but the store only had the red, black, white, and gray versions available. So, I paid $450 for the red phone "off-contract" and also received the wirelesss charging device (black) at no charge. When I decided to buy the Nokia, I was upgrading from my trusty HTC TITAN (AWESOME phone, btw!) and wanted to experience Microsoft's new mobile operating system. Windows Phone 8 is a fast and stable OS, which offers some enhancements not available on earlier models. Setting up my phone was extremely easy and you are offered very clear instructions on the device. Most of the AT&T; employees I met are not very savvy on Windows Phone devices, so I made sure I was the one setting up the device at the store. Upon entering my Windows Live info, I was pleasantly surprised to find that all my contacts transferred extremely fast (took less than a minute to transfer). Apps and media, however, required more time. By the way, the excellent Zune software used on Windows Phone 7.5 devices is incompatible with this phone. However, if you have Windows 7 on your PC, you can use Windows Explorer to transfer media files. If you have Windows 8 or a Mac, there's an app for transferring media to your phone. Also, there are some WP 7.5 apps which are not compatible with Windows Phone 8. For example, the Xbox LIVE game called "The Harvest" is currently incompatible and won't even show up in a Marketplace search when you use the Nokia 920. Update (2/16/13): Some apps are already being ported over to WP8, so it will take some time for this to happen.After about a day of using the Nokia Lumia 920, I noticed the battery discharged to 50% in two hours. I wasn't using it that much during those two hours, but when I was on YouTube, the Lumia's case got extremely hot. This led me to believe that there was a problem with the battery, because my HTC TITAN never had that type of problem. Anyway, I returned it to the ATT store and replaced it with a glossy white version. Now, my new Nokia Lumia 920 works fine and doesn't have any of the battery problems found on the red one I returned. Aside from the battery issue on my first phone, I really like the Lumia 920!Pros:- Nice high resolution screen w/ Gorilla Glass- Solid and beautiful case- Outstanding still camera and video records at 1080p- Camera can be upgraded, using software "lenses". These enhancements bring additional features to the device!- Dedicated camera button- Great Nokia apps- Great Marketplace layout- Quality WP apps (Check out "MetroTube")- Good sound- 32GB memory- NFC compliant- Xbox LIVE games- Drag and drop media onto phone- Wireless charging is built-in (requires special charger)- Full PC/Mac compatibility- The SkyDrive app allows fantastic integration with your cloud filesCons:- No expandable memory! That is probably my biggest gripe about this phone.- Can't transfer or purchase Zune videos to the phone (at least, I couldn't)- Heavy (but its a solid device)- No custom alert or notification sounds (custom ringtones and alarms only)- Marketplace still missing some major apps found on other platforms- Wish it had a 4.7" screen or larger, like my HTC TITAN (I do notice the difference in screen size)- No longer uses the Zune softwareOverall, I'm happy with the phone and have no regrets. I would certainly recommend this device to anyone looking for a Windows Phone device or a just a great smartphone.UPDATE - 2/6/13: I was asked if a data plan is required to use this phone. Well, the answer is yes and no. Yes, if you plan on using it on the carrier's cellular network. AT&T;, for example, will receive notification that you are using a smartphone to make calls and will charge you for data usage. On the other hand, if you don't intend to use it as a cellular phone and don't access the 3G/4G networks, you can use it as an Internet device. In other words, you can use Skype to make phone calls over wi-fi, continue to download and use apps, take pictures and video, and surf the Internet over wi-fi. I used to do that with my old HTC Titan (Windows Phone 7.5) without any problems.Bottom-line: Highly recommend this phone for someone who wants a powerful, "does-all" device! If you are tied deeply to iOS and/or Android and can't handle change, the transition might not be so great. However, five solid stars for this device!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009ZC90P0" id="B009ZC90P0-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-19:</strong> I did considerable research before selecting this phone.

I love this phone!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009ZC90P0" id="B009ZC90P0-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-18:</strong> Windows 8 apps are a welcome change from iOS. Among the three ecosystems, I prefer Android, Windows 8, and iOS in that order. Blackberry, what ?! For ease of use, Windows phone is really easy to use. For someone interested in a first smartphone, Lumia 920 is an excellent choice. I got access to few Windows 8 phones to review. I will try to review them, but since I have not used for a period longer than a month I am not reviewing for reliability. User interface in Windows 8 is very pleasing and this is one of best phones with awesome user experience. If you prefer great user experience over infinite hackability, aka Android, then Windows 8 phones are great choice.The Lumia 920 has a stunning 4.5" IPS LCD, 1280x768 resolution, 332 ppi display. This phone has up to 32 GB storage and 1 GB RAM.  8.7 MP camera and a 1080p HD Video.  1.5 GHz dual core processor. I have extensively used in the past HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised it has become more buttery smooth now. This phone has Gorilla Glass 2. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning's Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of "armor," making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are "stuffed" into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.Lumia 920 does not support microSD expansion. I always feel this is a bummer. But with 32GB it is plenty with current app ecosystem.  These phones seem to be copying iPhone philosophy.  Battery 2000 mAh Lithium polymer battery (Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery.) Unlike the Nokia Lumia 820, the Lumia 920 doesn't have a removable battery cover, which means you can't access or replace your battery. __Not having a storage expansion slot is a bummer for lot of people! Not being able to remove battery is a double bummer.__  For me, storage expansion and removal of battery is very important, so I was disappointed. This is the downside the unibody design.  Wireless charging is a big plus, though!Phone quality was excellent and speakerphone was awesome. Nice to see built in active noise cancellation with a dedicated mic. Nice to see Lumia 920 has Bluetooth 4.0. Bluetooth low energy (BLE), known as WiBree,is a subset of Bluetooth v4.0 with an entirely new protocol stack. As an alternative to the Bluetooth standard protocols that were introduced in Bluetooth v1.0 to v3.0, it is aimed at very low power applications running off a coin cell. I was able to get excellent reception with Bluetooth headset,Jaybird Sportsband Stereo Bluetooth Headphone - Bulk Packaging - Midnight BlackandJayBird BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Midnight BlackAll the usual smartphone stuff, facebook, twitter, music, emails etc are all excellent. It is only the third party apps that are lacking in some arenas. If you are Microsoft heavy like Office suites, Lumia phone are awesome!Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times. Lumia has GPS receiver with A-GPS and GLONASS support. I tried with Garmin Navigon app which turned out to be great in giving voice directions. App ecosystem is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don't have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year. I really hope for Windows 8 platform to surge ahead because having a 3 way competition with iOS and Android is good for the ecosystem.ONE LINE SUMMARY: The Nokia Lumia 920 is certainly the best Windows Phone 8 smartphone on the market right now.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009ZC90P0" id="B009ZC90P0-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-20:</strong> I've had two Lumia 900s, both suffered drops that cracked the screen (though they also made it safely through quite a few drops, I am a klutz).  So I decided to get the 920, and I am thrilled with it.  It comes in some gorgeous colors (bright yellow!), and it has such a beautiful and sleek form factor that I'm loathe to put it in a case (hence my blue Lumia 900's vulnerability to drops). It gets excited looks and questions wherever I go.  Last week I took it out during a meeting with about 15 of our marketing folks (predominantly young guys), and it ended up getting passed around the room with lots of positive chatter - until the conversation turned to apps.  I agree, it has most of the apps I want, but not all of the ones that I used consistently on my iPhone, and that has been the downfall of Nokia phones in recent history.The marketing campaign for the 900 was all about how everyone had been a smartphone beta tester, and this was the real deal. Followed closely by a software glitch bad enough that Nokia then gave a credit to everyone who bought a subsidized phone that made the phone FREE. There are still some problems with the Lumia line. This Lumia has had some rebooting issues, the battery life is still not great (you are running on vapors by the end of every day), and it's hefty. It fits in a pocket, but you really feel it, especially if you sit down.  All in all, however, I do love this phone and I love having something that not everyone else has.PROS*Form Factor: it's different, and gorgeous, and a conversation starter.  People want it, or want to try it.*Camera: It has a great 8.7 megapixel camera with optical image stabilization (Carl Zeiss, as always with Nokia) and takes good images even inside my house even with curtains drawn.  Sharp.*Screen: 4.5 inch screen with gorilla glass, stunningly sharp 1280 x 760 resolution and blur reduction.  It is also impressively sensitive.  Nokia is based in Finland, and they have 10 months of cold. Nokia engineers have been very motivated to make a phone that can be used while wearing gloves.*Operating System: The Windows operating system features bold, bright colors, animated images, and a very intuitive and easy interface.  I try to restrict my conversations with friends because inevitably people ask to play with the pretty interface and seem to have no qualms about opening my personal email, work email, and texts. I'm still not sure how much I like it that this phone is so attractive and attracting that it makes people forget boundaries.*Responsiveness: Superb. It has a dual-core processor, but it's optimized to run smoothly on slower chips. 60 fps screen refresh rate. It's zippy in most everything you do. 4G/LTE supported.*Maps: best in the business, and Nokia Drive is awesome. I used the 920 when I was in Chicago and it got me where I wanted to go via buses (I know, I'm cheap) every day with no issues (bus times, stop locations, etc).*Some sweet extras: wireless charging and near field communication. And they finally give you a way to resize your tiles, a lack that annoyed me with the 900. Also interfaces with my Xbox 360. I still can't set up my TV programs to record (via my cable provider) like I could with my iPhone however.*Sound: one of the things that seems improved - music quality is not bad if I forget my headphones and I can carry on business calls via speaker.*Price: a LOT cheaper than an iPhone.CONS*Size: heavy, big in your pocket and just slightly too big to be comfortable in your hand.*Battery: Yes, it's a jaw-droppingly beautiful display, but a little shorter battery life is the result.*Operating System: Still some glitches. Nokia did spit out the Lumia line pretty quickly after the partnership with Microsoft was inked, and they are still on an aggressive timeline.  The company is in trouble, and clearly is trying to strike the balance between getting this phone into people's hands while still maintaining quality.*My plea to Nokia: I want to see the time/date and notifications without activating the phone. I loved the N9 for that.  Please bring that functionality to Lumia.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009ZC90P0" id="B009ZC90P0-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-26:</strong> I liked the phone, is spectacular but I liked that did not bring headphones because that is very important and brings the symbol of AT & T. ..

The OS isn't as sleek as Android or iOS. It doesn't have a lot of apps. But if you want a phone with an amazing camera and offline maps, then yes, switch to Win8. If you depend on a lot of apps, then don't make the switch because you will regret it. You Will.You can tell that Windows was late to the Smartphone race.. so late... so late.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DCXWBMM" id="B00DCXWBMM-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-05:</strong> Not factory unlocked.

Really, she couldn't care less about multiple apps or widgets or rooting her phone. She just wants Facebook status updates, a decent Contacts app in a form factor that is somewhat smaller than the recent spate of monster-sized Android phones. (As an aside, personally, I use either a Galaxy Note 2 or a Galaxy S4, both rooted - she wants nothing to do with all that).This phone fit the bill perfectly. After a bit of a learning curve, she fell into a routine with this phone. Call quality is great. The keyboard is spot-on perfect for her smaller hands. She loves this phone.Well, she loves it when it works, anyway.Lately, this phone has been powering off at strange times. Sometimes it requires a soft reset to bring it back. Other times, simply plugging it into the charger is enough to bring it back to life. After a quick trip through the Googles, I'm finding that we're waiting for a specific over-the-air firmware update to resolve this problem.Thing is, that firmware update hasn't hit her phone yet. So...the waiting game.If your phone's OS is  8.0.10327.78, you are still waiting for the firmware update.Aside from this absolutely MAJOR issue with the phone's stability, its a wonderful flagship device for Windows Phone 8. Its really too bad that people don't give it a fair shake. Its not nearly as feature rich as a Droid, nor does it have as many apps as an iPhone. But there are just certain people out there who really...don't care about all that. They want the uncomplicated basics. Most of those people buy iPhones because family insists or have Androids foisted upon them by overeager Best Buy geeks. (nothing against the geeks - I am one)Those people should be looking at Windows Phone 8. And provided they get a phone that isn't broken right off the bat, I think they'll enjoy the experience.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DCXWBMM" id="B00DCXWBMM-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-07:</strong> I really wanted to give this phone 4 stars, but due to an extremely aggravating bug in the OS, I cannot. I bought this phone the first week it was available in the US, to replace my existing Nokia Astound (8GB, 8MP camera, Symbian OS). Mainly I wanted a larger, crisp screen and a more customizable interface, and of course a nice camera. WP and the Nokia Lumia 925 seemed to offer all of this, and indeed it does.In retrospect, I now realize that the trouble started one night in mid-September when I was exploring the different menus of the WP OS. I stumbled upon the very last item on the App list, "Wi-Fi Calling." I had never had a cell phone that was even capable of Wi-Fi calling, so I was intrigued. There are three settings offered: "Wi-Fi Preferred", "Cellular Preferred", or "Wi-Fi Only." Actually there is a fourth setting: Wi-Fi Calling "On" or "Off". I didn't really trust the technology yet, so changed the setting from "Wi-Fi Preferred" to "Cellular Preferred." Over the next month, a very aggravating thing began happening: I would pull out my phone to make a call, and get a "No Cellular Service" message. Or a message stating "You are in Airplane Mode". Or, "Cellular Service is turned off, do you want to turn cellular service on?" Reasonable responses to all of these messages never resulted in re-engagement of the cellular signal. In fact, I gradually discovered that the only thing that would return cellular service was to turn the phone off and then turn it back on, whereupon it immediately resumed its normal functions.I began missing phone calls from friends and relatives. Sometimes over a day would pass before I would realize my phone was no longer functioning as a phone. It was infuriating and extremely disappointing. I found myself apologizing to people who were trying to get ahold of me. Texts would not come through either, while it was locked into this Wi-Fi calling hell on earth. Naturally, the only time I got frustrated enough to take it back to the store was after I had re-booted it, and so it worked fine while I was at the store.I finally did some online searching, and actually stating my problem using ask.com revealed the answer: Choosing "Cellular Preferred" causes your phone to lock into Wi-Fi calling mode. I have turned off Wi-Fi calling completely, and plan never to use it again. It's not worth almost having a nervous breakdown over. I want to like this phone, but right now it is in the dog house, and it's going to have to work to earn my trust back.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DCXWBMM" id="B00DCXWBMM-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-17:</strong> Purchased the Lumia 925 after cutting my teeth on a Lumia 521.Moving up to the 925 for me was an easy decision seeing how well WP fits my wants.Very elegant device!In need of a case for the phone since I'm terrified I'm going to something clumsy.Excellent piece of hardware.A definite winner in my opinion.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DCXWBMM" id="B00DCXWBMM-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-09:</strong> If you are looking for a great Windows Phone 8 based phone, and you don't need the 41 MP camera on the 1020, then you will almost certainly be happy with this phone. And the phone's 8 MP camera actually puts out some very nice snapshots that you won't mind sharing on Facebook or via the now-available Instagram.The phone's performance is &#34;peppy&#34; and I have not noticed any slow down at all. Switching between apps is very easy, simple and fast. The only thing I find odd is not closing apps - Windows Phone just expects you to leave apps open and they will eventually close themselves after a set amount of time of non-use. Yeah, you can do ctrl-q, but that's not really what the developers intended (which is odd).The Windows Phone 8 store doesn't have as many games as say, the iOS or Android ecosystems, but what is there is not bad. My favorite mobile game, Contre Jour, is available, though things like Candy Crush are not, which really has me scratching my head.If you are looking for a good camera, attached to an easy to use OS and makes good quality calls, then the Lumi 925 is a darn fine choice. Just realize you aren't getting all the apps (many of which people don't use, though some people DO use are still not available natively) as the Android/iPhone equivalents and you should be happy.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DCXWBMM" id="B00DCXWBMM-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-29:</strong> </p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00DCXWBMM', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00DCXWBMM', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B005Y3D8ZC</h2>    <p class="price"> $B005Y3D8ZC</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

When recording video, not only does the image bounce because of the focusing issue but a crackle/snapping sound is heard on all recorded videos.  All of these issues are factory related issues.  These are defects that Samsung built into the product at the factory.  My next phone will be a ZTE.

Samsung products make rooting a breeze by basically giving you easy access to do it through the Download menu in the phone's bootloader and with software called Odin that runs on your PC to get the needed files and software you need onto the phone.That aside, the bright vivid LED screen and smoothness of the animations make the Galaxy S4 the best phone on the market. Even the newer S5 isn't a better option to me because it's got very few improvements over the S4 and costs a lot more.The one major downside to the S4 is it's durability. The phone has a plastic construction that looks very nice, but one drop say...oh I don't know....on its' side into the corner of the bathroom sink....and it's got a shattered screen. However, the screen is easily replaceable. In fact the entire device has component parts that unplug from the main motherboard so they can be easily replaced if something like your camera goes bad. And its' not hard to open the device up and swap out defective parts.The most common flaw I see in these is dust build up near the proximity sensor, which causes the phone to always think it is near your face and thus it will keep a black screen after a phone call. This is easily fixed by opening up the housing and cleaning out the sensor. The whole process took me about 10 minutes.All the nerdy stuff aside, if you are jus tlooking for a great reliable stable phone, the S4 is a great option. It's processor allows for smooth scrolling and stable operation. It can also handle any app or game you throw at it with ease.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CIZFK9G" id="B00CIZFK9G-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-04:</strong> arrived intact and works perfectly on my computer Venezuela, shame that came with the logo of tmobile, but it's a good product and is intact</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CIZFK9G" id="B00CIZFK9G-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-03:</strong> This is my first Samsung love it, shipping was super fast.

My wife started saying she liked the stylus for her iPad so I thought it'd be a neat present for her to get her a stylus in the color she likes, pink or purple.  Low and behold there are a ton of capacitive stylus' on Amazon to purchase so I got a pack from this very same seller.  While I was checking out I noticed tethers for them kept coming up.  After reading a little about them I thought wow that's a great idea, just tether the stylus to the iPad using the ear bud plugin.  This pack came with some short ones for the iPod which works great and some longer ones for the iPad which also work great...  Just loop the ring through your stylus and then plug the other end of the tether into your headphone jack hole and the stylus is always together with your iPad/iPod, love it...Thanks for a great idea guys, highly recommended.  And get the Capacitive Stylus pack too, they're perfect for soduko and words with friends, etc...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0081SDM8U" id="B0081SDM8U-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-10:</strong> These exceeded my expectations due to the low price.

My only complaint is that I would prefer to have more of the 14" tethers & less of the 4".  The anchor just slides in the connector for the headset & can be easily removed if I need to use my headset.  Most of my stylus came with the pre-drilled hole where the tether connects.  The connecting ring is sturdy & so far they have lasted better than I anticipated!!!  Due to the record keeping laws currently in place, I gave a couple of the 14" tethers to my doctor to help her keep her stylus from walking away from the sign-in computers.  She says they have cut down on her expense for office supplies in buying replacement stylus for those that were constantly walking off.  The price is reasonable, the tethers are quality& no matter where I take my Fire, my stylus is with it!!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0081SDM8U" id="B0081SDM8U-review23" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-26:</strong> I bought a few multi-packs of stylus' for my kids' tablets as well as mine and my wife's use.

Price is right, they do the job, perfectly and there's a variety to choose from.These are not elastic, rather a string-like with no stretch.Enjoy</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0081SDM8U" id="B0081SDM8U-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-29:</strong> I received this set as a review sample and stress tested one, and used another for a day to evaluate the function. For the stress test I stretched one until it broke just to see how sturdy they are. It took a lot to break it, so the tensile strength of the elastic cord is relatively high. I do not know how many pounds it finally took, but I am betting over one hundred. Note: I pulled behind the wire loops on each end, so that part was not tested.For the functional use I attached this lanyard to one of this brand'sExtra Long XXL Micro-Knit Hybrid Fiber Tip Capacitive Stylus Pen, which is extra long and not well suited to shorter lanyards. I had no trouble using that pen tethered to this lanyard, even on the 10.1 inch tablet I employed as the test bed. I could easily reach any point on the tablet without interference of the lanyard itself.  I love the way that this lanyard uses a dust plug that fits into the 3.5mm port on my tablet. That is a clever design.Do note that if you are using a Samsung phone or tablet with an S-pen this lanyard will not work with it. I tested this on my Galaxy Note 3 using a third party stylus and there was more than enough room to move it around. However, there was no way to attach this to the S-pen, and that is normal because that stylus was designed to fit a hold in the phone itself, obviating the need for a lanyard.For me a dozen of these is a lifetime supply of lanyards. However, reading other reviews it's apparent that some folks go through lanyards quickly. If you are one of those, this package is a bargain because of not only price, but the fact that these lanyards are well made and should last a long time.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0081SDM8U" id="B0081SDM8U-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-08:</strong> I like the longer cords.

The string holds fine and we like that they tether to the device through a plug that fits into the speaker jack of our devices (we use bluetooth so that connector is seldom used).  The ring at the end is an inexpensive, thin metal but it does the job and is easily bent in/out as needed.  The price was right as well.

Well, I purposely chose to buy the amPen 3-in-1 Hybrid Stylus knowing it is not designed to attach a tether line. But I found a workable way around this dilemma.The hybrid stylus has a sturdy clip that fits nice and tight against the body of the stylus.  With this in mind, I bought the tether strings (made by The Friendly Swede). I tethered the one end with a metal ring in-between the clip of the stylus and its frame; and the other end of this tether with a rubber plug into my devices ear plug inserts. The metal rings hold snuggly in-place between the stylus clip and frame and the rubber plug at the other end of the tether fits nicely and firmly (but not tightly).In conclusion, the "Bundle of 12 Detachable Tether Strings" does exactly what it is designed for. My work-around-method attaching this tether to the stylus and to my devices proves adequate. The ring between the stylus clip and frame holds firmly but may scratch the places in-between the clip and frame (for me small price to pay). I purposely tested the attached tether by lightly but firmly pulling on the stylus (it remain snugged); and gently but firmly pulling the rubber plug from my devices. The results, satisfactory; The ring remained caught between the stylus clip and frame; and the rubber plug released from my devices ear plug insert easily. I give the "Bundle of 12 Detachable Tethers" a five star for its purposeful design and its intended use.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0081SDM8U" id="B0081SDM8U-review33" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-24:</strong> EXCELLENT PRICE FOR WHAT YOU GET.

It should be noted that the three I received are not shaped like the picture, mine aren't square. See my section about design for more info.Feel/Durability:The screen protector itself feels great. I like the feel of the material when sliding my finger across it; it is slightly tacky but not bad. I have not had any experience with them tearing on me. I pulled on the first one, after I messed up the application (see below), and it didn't rip, seems tough enough.Application:I wasn't particularly impressed by the application of these. While they are easy to stick down, they don't like to stay down. On my first one I pulled off the first layer and stuck it down. Cleared out all of the bubbles so that it looked nice; it was not hard to line it up with the holes at top or bottom. When I went to pull up the top cover, the entire thing came off. This could be partly because I wasn't paying attention, but it is also due to the fact that the outer covers are attached incredibly well. I was much more careful on my second attempt and I didn't have any trouble, but I was very slow with pulling the top cover off and made sure I held down the main part against the screen. The included directions are very simple and just like that of other dry apply screen protectors. It does include the needed soft card and screen wipe.Design:The design of this screen protector is very weird. It is like nothing I have ever seen before on a screen protector and I have bought protectors for several different devices and several different brands; however, this is my first time buying a Fosmon. What was so weird is that is that it is not the shape that I expected or the shape that is pictured. The protector is curved in on the sides. It is still square on top and bottom with rounded corners, but the sides curve in about 1/10&#34;. This means that it doesn't cover the entire screen area, though it covers most of it. It does include the proper cutouts for the speaker, microphone, and proximity sensor which means that it is better than the protector I received from ArmorSuit.Final Thoughts (TL;DR):These aren't the greatest but certainly aren't the worst screen protectors I have ever owned (looking at you ArmorSuit Military Shield). These protectors include the important things, all the proper cutouts and generally the correct size and shape of the screen. They feel great on the screen, probably one of my favorites as far as feel. I do worry how long these will stay stuck to the screen before needing replaced. My phone case covers the corners so as to help hold them in place, but the cutouts on the side mean that the side edges are not covered by my case and could get bent up.I would probably not buy these again just because of the weird shape. If I knew these would be the proper shape, then I would totally buy them again.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DJ70DXU" id="B00DJ70DXU-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-06:</strong> works well and stays put.  The 928 has a slight curve on the edge of the screen and protectors generally do not adhere to that area of the screen.  These protectors are tapered around that curve, so part of the screen is uncovered.  This prevents the entire protector from peeling up which several other did for me.  This was the first to say put.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DJ70DXU" id="B00DJ70DXU-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-11:</strong> I was looking for a screen protector and got this one, it's super easy to apply and fit really well in my nokia Lumia 928.Now, I am very happy and not worried about scratches.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DJ70DXU" id="B00DJ70DXU-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-01:</strong> These screen protectors fit perfectly and the fact that 3 came in the pack I should not have to get more for a while.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00DJ70DXU', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00DJ70DXU', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B008RMMUFG</h2>    <p class="price"> $B008RMMUFG</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

For $10, it's pretty well made, has a good length and the tip is very smooth. I have a BestSkinsEver soft protector on my Nexus screen and it proved to create too much friction when used with dirt cheap stylus (50c). But the Magicwand has no such problem.

The backlight turns on, but the LCD does not display a picture.  I have experience repairing Iphones, and am familiar with how to do it.  I took the old screen and plugged the connectors in, and the old screen worked perfectly fine.The new screen came well packed in a nice plastic container with foam on both sides.  The tools that came with it were okay, but I usually use my own set of magnetic screwdrivers.  The screen removal tools are usually 1 time use, as they usually get eaten up.  This screen also came with double sided tape in the shape of the phone.  It was not cut specifically for this phone, so I used bits and pieces that I cut off with scissors in some areas being sure not to obstruct the front camera or sensors.If this screen had actually worked, this would have received a 5 star rating.  It had what appeared to be an inspection sticker on it, which gave me confidence that the screen would work properly, but it could have just been a part number or even inspection rejection sticker.  I really wanted this screen to work.  The fit of the screw lugs was perfect.  On another screen replacement job, the replacement screen worked, but the screw lugs were badly toleranced and I had to drill them out to get the screws to fit.  This one lined up very well and got my hopes up, but the screen itself did not work.Now I have to wait for another replacement screen, and I have to do the full disassembly and reassembly process over again.  I hope other people have better luck.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A712FE6" id="B00A712FE6-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-25:</strong> Ive order multiple items from Bravolink and they don't disappoint ever.

Item is good enough.  Ever so slightly thicker than the original glass but I swear I wouldn't have even noticed if it had been for other reviewers.  Tint seemed fine but I wouldn't know because I ended up pulling the digitizer cable too far and ripped it.  In my opinion the digitizer seemed too short but I'll never know for sure.About me:I do IT consulting and I consider myself fairly technical.  I play with hardware all the time and I've had my share of laptop repairs from screen replacement to even motherboard replacements but this screen thing is at a whole new level.  Once my initial attempt failed I tried putting the old broken screen back in, but it was too late.  I ended up getting a replacement phone altogether.Conclusion:Bottom line is that whether you feel qualified to do this repair yourself or not it's too high risk.  If you mess up your laptop you have other means to connect.  If your phone is gone, it's like cutting off your lifeline.  Perhaps part of me wanted this phone gone so I could get a new 4G phone, but the end point is that I suffered dearly for it because I didn't have a backup plan and had a trip coming.Recommendations:If you absolutely must take on this endeavor be sure to backup your phone with means to access your contacts and calendar online in the very least.  I recommend using a Gmail account to keep it all synched.  Also if you end up replacing your phone and the only thing you have is a dumb phone beware that the carrier may force you to switch plans along with it.  Lastly, if you end up purchasing a phone online be sure you get it from a reputable vendor for it might be stolen and Verizon black lists stolen phones and won't let you switch into them.  When speaking with a rep he told me I should first ask for the ESN and check with them before purchase.

I do often get a slight delay that I never got with my factory glass, but I can deal with that for $30 (a $120 savings over Apple replacing the phone- they do not replace front glass). I'd have given it 3 stars except the first one coming defective (a common problem from the reviews) and wasting a whole night and another week of incapacitated phone. If they had better quality control and it was a rare occurrence, I could forgive but since its common I'm taking a star off.In my first kit, the screwdriver was too large so I had to go out and buy one. For both kits I also had to buy a magnetizer (just a few bucks at home depot)- a little rectangle you put the screwdriver in to magnatize it- in order to be able to keep the screws in place long enough to screw them in. This kit is really far from perfection but if I crack my screen, I'd buy it again.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A712FE6" id="B00A712FE6-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-03:</strong> Received in less than a week and was very well packed.

Haven't tried any of the &#34;accessory&#34; &#34;clip ons&#34; because I'm pretty much satisfied with just how the case is as I got it.  One thing I'd like to point out.  I started off with a MUCH more expensive Otterbox case for my Note 3... Which did NOT have a cover for the stylus... which also promptly fell out and got lost.  The TRIDENT case on the other hand DOES have a little &#34;port&#34; cover which pretty much sets it apart from almost every other case I checked out.  The fact that it was half the price of my Otterbox case... with a better selection of features... that was just icing.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00H9HRR1W" id="B00H9HRR1W-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-06:</strong> If you are on the go a lot (and I mean like running around, moving, and being outdoors), this is the case for you.  Also nice to have a removable kick stand and you get the optional connector for the car mount or any other base (like the tripod stand is cool too).  99% good fitment (mine came with the corner slightly warped but it still closes and still protects just like an Otterbox Defender.  I like how the outer case has a place where I can tie off 4 lanyards if I wanted to suspend the phone for photos if I use those retractable lanyard cords, pretty cool stuff).  There's also the typical lower centered lanyard hole you can use as ell show in the picture of the 2 little holes on the bottom of the back of the case.  The screen protector is ok for what it is and I had to use some anti-static methods to clean the screen before installing it as I hate having stuff between the glass and screen protector.  At the end of the day, this case rocks like no other at half the cost.Edit and update:  so after looking around and making sure I didn't miss anything, my package was indeed was missing the belt clip/holster.  Rather than just sending the whole thing back to Amazon, I was able to get in with contact with Trident via email (cs@tridentcase.com) which I found this this email address from their website FAQ section.  I sent the email stating that my package never had one and I spec'd them what I bought and they are sending me out a new one.  What a nice company!  Also in their FAQ if your belt clip broke, you can also contact them directly for a replacement as well.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00H9HRR1W" id="B00H9HRR1W-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-29:</strong> I ended up getting an aegis case instead of the kraken.

With triple layer of protection this case can withstand a very high level of abuse, and it has been tested to Military Standards to meet or exceed MIL-STD-810L requirements. What makes it so tough? Let's take a closer look.Just like all other Trident cases, it arrived in a box with a clear front display and a full view of the case where the back of the box had details of all the features. The side of the box also includes icons of available AMS attachments. AMS is actually stands for Adaptive Modular System which enables various attachments/accessories to be connected to the back of the outer exoskeleton shell. The case design starts with an inner soft silicon shell, which is actually sold by itself as Perseus AMS case for Note 3. This is a light duty soft sleeve case which you can use as standalone for the occasions when you need just a minimal scratch and bump protection. Once you are ready for a more serious protection, you place Perseus AMS case into a heavy duty exoskeleton shell made out of hardened PC material with reinforced TPE corners. The same TPE material is used to fully seal power and volume buttons (still allowing an easy access and tactile response), and to protect with flexible port covers headphone, micro-usb, and s-pen ports. This outer shell also features a loop for lanyard to add more security when handling this case outdoors, and opening for sliding AMS accessories. The TPE corners also work as skid pads to prevent case from sliding across the surface.In order to enhance screen protection of your Note 3, Kraken AMS adds a front frame with an attached screen protector, similar to Cyclops series model. This adds an ultimate screen scratch protection and seals the screen for use in a light rain, dust, or wind. It doesn't make this case waterproof since you still have openings for home buttons, speaker, camera and notification light, but it gives you a piece of mind if you need to use your phone or take a call outside when elements of nature are not in your favor. As part of AMS system, you get one of the accessories bundled with a case - multimedia kickstand. Solid metal construction, its a nice interlocking kickstand for landscape/portrait positioning of your phone to enjoy watching a movie or YT video, etc. In addition, this Kraken AMS case also comes with a unique belt clip holster. We all know how big Note 3 is to begin with, so using an even bigger holster would add more bulk to carry on your belt clip. Here, Trident came up with a minimal design approach of a slim holster bracket with a clip that can rotate 360 degree and securely attaches to the front of your phone/case.Overall, this is one tough case to consider if you are looking for a serious protection for your Note 3 and would like to have flexibility of either slimming it down or adding more options as part of it's modular system.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00H9HRR1W" id="B00H9HRR1W-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-13:</strong> Beware if you order this case, because you might end up with this one, because I&#8217;m sending it back!  I thought it would be safe to buy a case that is fulfilled by Amazon&#8230;I thought my odds of getting ripped off would be less likely.  Not this time!  This case was not only opened and used&#8230;it must have been returned and re-sold in faulty condition.  First, the container arrived dirty, tattered, and half open.  I took the case out and noticed the rubber bumpers were dirty.  I looked closer and the screen protector looked like it was pushed in and it there were smudges all over it, and there&#8217;s a crease in the screen protector near the home button.  I opened the case and there was hair and/or sting-like stuff on the inside of the screen protector part of the case.  The belt-clip is a flimsy piece of s***.  Finally, the kick-stand doesn't stay closed.  It just flops in and out.  This case has obviously been used.  The one good thing I can say about this case is that it truly looks tough&#8230;like it can take a beating.  Unfortunately, this case has already taken a beaten.  I CANNOT ACCEPT THIS!  It must go back.  If I had owned this for 6-months and it looked like this&#8230;fine.  But I cannot accept this looking this way brand new straight out of the box.  No way.  I paid $12 for a cheap rugged case for my son, and it&#8217;s a way better deal than this!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00H9HRR1W', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00H9HRR1W', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00827EGG2</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00827EGG2</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

Te two ports (one is 1A and the other is 2.1A) are clearly marked on the top! Clearly marked! As I can read them without my glasses or a magnifying glass!Many batteries that I have tested come with a cord that has a plug on top for all devices. This one comes with a micro cord (used for charging the battery and devices) AND clips that fit over the micro end to convert it to lightning and 30 pin for Apple products.The flashlight is a tiny LED bulb and could be used to light things up in an emergency, but it would not be practical to carry given the size and weight. But the flashlight aspect is always appreciated.Best of all, it actually has understandable instructions.The one thing of note is that the one I received has a turquoise rather than light blue color .. very classy.I received a complimentary sample to test for a review.

So this battery is more powerful than that of my iPad 3 by a little.

It's pretty compact considering it has a 12000mAh capacity, measuring roughly 3 inches wide and six inches tall. It's about 5/8 inches thick. The size, plus the fact that it weighs 11.1 ounces, makes this rather large for carrying in a pocket. However, it slips into a tablet carry case without a problem. Given that the capacity is something best suited to a tablet, I don't find the size at all objectionable.The case feels metal-like, but it is plastic. The build quality is excellent - it feels solid, and the case has a matte finish that looks good and hides fingerprints perfectly. It has a rounded profile making it easy to put into, and pull out of, a laptop or tablet bag without it getting snagged on anything.All the ports are at the top end. There are two USB output ports (one is 1A; one is 2.1A), a micro USB input port for charging, and a LED flashlight. It has the usual LED "gas gauge" to show the power level left. The LED indicators are blue, easily seen, but don't blind you like other indicators I've seen. The on/off button is on the side, sticks out enough so it can be easily found, and has a positive click so you know the press has been registered.My only quibble is that the port output ratings are sliver on sliver, making them hard to read. Black text would have been a better approach.Zero complaints with performance.It's a good choice if you're looking for a large capacity powerbank that has a slim (for the capacity) profile and solid build quality. Highly recommend.[Sample provided for review]</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IKEVZSO" id="B00IKEVZSO-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-01:</strong> The bottom line on the Onite battery is this: it works. In the past I've tried several different reserve power supplies for my gadgets, and I have had mixed results. However, there is no ambiguity about this battery: it's large, effective, versatile and well designed. It's one of the largest external battery that I've come across in terms of capacity (with whopping 12,000 mAh of charge), and yet it's much smaller in size than some of its larger near-competitors.In order to test this battery charger I decided to completely drain my small electronic devices so that I get as clean of an idea of this battery's efficiency as I can. (As an aside, when you really want to discharge them, the consumer electronics has become really robust in recent year. It took me much longer than I thought it would. I had to blast music from my iPhone for hours and hours ...) I discover that I was able to fully charge all of my small electronic devices with plenty of power to spare. Most of them I was able to charge several times, and thanks to dual USB ports, was able to charge up to two devices at once. Full charging usually takes between one to two hours. I've tested this battery with iPhone 5S, iPhone 4S,iPhone 3G,Kindle Keyboard, Kindle Paperwhite,Mobee Magic Bar,Jabra SPORT Bluetooth Stereo Headset, and the first generationiPad (32GB, Wifi + 3G). Oftentimes I was able to fully charge four or five devices with just one fully charged Onite battery. I was also able to charge my iPad completely, and even charge it to almost half its capacity the second time around. If there was an easy way of connecting this battery to an ultrabook I would not be surprised if it would be possible to charge it to a decent amount as well.The battery comes with an AC charger, micro USB cable, iPhone 30-pin adapter and an Apple lightning adapter. The inclusion of iPhone adapter is very convenient for those of us in the iOS land - most manufacturers of these batteries just assume that we'll bring our own cables.This Onite battery is also beautifully designed. You would not be ashamed of being spotted with this battery at a trendy tech conference. The battery is very easy to use and operate, and overall vey intuitively designed.I am very pleased and impressed with this rechargeable external battery. It is effective, portable, and very affordable. I would recommend it to anyone who travels a lot or uses their gadgets on the go all the time. It can even be carried around in your messenger bag during your daily commute - it will not add that much extra weight.***** Review product provided by the manufacturer. *****</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IKEVZSO" id="B00IKEVZSO-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-20:</strong> Hits the sweet spot in power banksThe Onite Pandora 12,000 mAh power bank hits the sweet spot, combining high capacity, attractive design, and excellent manufacturing quality, all at an excellent value.The case is brushed aluminum with end caps of ABS, the same plastic Legos are made of.  I&#8217;m guessing that it is manufactured in a factory alongside cell phones or laptops because of the way it&#8217;s built.It has all the standard features one would expect, such as a four-LED capacity display, both 1.0 and 2.1 A ports, and smart circuitry.  However, it also has a built-in LED flashlight of moderate strength that will be quite handy when travelling or in an emergency and as a bonus, charging tips for both iPhone 4 and 5 are included.The 12,000 mAh battery will provide at least 9,600 mAh of usable capacity, using a conservative 80% efficiency factor.  That will recharge an iPhone 5 or Kindle Paperwhite at least six times and even fully recharge an iPad air or give a big boost to a notebook.No complaints at all about this power bank. It is even delivered fully charged!Sample provided for testing and unbiased review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IKEVZSO" id="B00IKEVZSO-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-16:</strong> The Onite 12000mAh power bank is probably one of the best on the market right now for price, size and power.  It's about the size of a Samsung Galaxy and lightweight enough make for perfect long distance traveling whether in a car or plane or train.This Power Bank will charge just about anything.  It comes with a charger USB link for your computer, but whatever smartphone or tablet you own (Apple included), you probably have the needed adapter.  Also included are a `lighting pin' adapter and a `lighting pin to 30-pin adapter'.  The power bank came fully charged and when depleted, took about five-six hours to fully charge. When I attached my iPad mini and my iPhone 4S, and both were at 20% power, they both recharged in about four hours. I would imagine that an iPad would solely charge in about the same time.There are two USB ports that can power or charge: USB port 1 provides 1A, whereas USB port 2 .1 A. You can also charge the power bank while it is you are using one.  There is also a small emergency light that comes on when the small power button is pushed.  This is more of a novelty, but could supply enough light, say, in a glove compartment at night.The power bank cell is a Polymer lithium battery encased in an aluminum light blue shell.  The power is indicated by the presence of four tiny bright blue LED lights representing 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% power.  I love this high capacity power bank as I can take it on a trip and it will last the length of the trip.  It will power my iPhone 4S about five times completely and my iPad2 about two times.  It's great to have on a coast to coast plane trip. I never worry about having enough power.  I also wait until the bank is down to 25% before I recharge it.  For the price and the quality and length of battery power, this is one of the better power banks.

What sets this one apart is the price, which at thirty bucks at the time of this review is a bargain, and capacity. I put the review sample I received through its paces and it passed all of the test points I normally check.First, the battery itself charges in about twelve hours, which is fairly quick for one at this capacity.  Second, it fast charged both my Galaxy Note 3 phone and my Samsung Tab 3 10.1 simultaneously. The Note 3 is not much of a challenge, but the Tab 3 is on the power hungry side and is slow to charge off of anything other than the wall charger it shipped with. So that alone won me over and inspired me to give it five stars.The form factor is on the large side, but as a desk charger it is not an issue. I would not recommend lugging it around in a purse or pocket. I love the aluminum exterior which is not only attractive, but serves a purpose.As for capacity, I always multiply the claimed capacity by .9 because batteries lose some in the charging process, as well as being affected by temperature, the age of the battery itself and even the cable you use. Using my formula I am approximating the effective capacity of this out of the box to be 10800 mAh, which is still enough capacity to charge an iPhone 5S with its internal 1440mAh battery 7.5 times.It's also more than 3 times the capacity of my Note 3's 3300mAh battery, and slightly over 90% of the capacity of an iPad 2's 11,560mAh battery and 1.5 times the capacity of the 6800mAh battery in my Samsung Tab 3.The above boosts in the use time of the devices I cited are impressive, especially if you are a power user with a phone and tablet and are on the go. I love mine and have been using it steadily since I received it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IKEVZSO" id="B00IKEVZSO-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-30:</strong> This is a beautiful power bank.  It's sleek . . . a pretty shade of matte blue, which means it resists fingerprints and doesn't mar easily.  The Onite is capable of charging up to two tablets at once.  Alternatively, it can give the Kindle Fire HD 8.9" tablet a full charge with a little bit of juice left over.The only drawback is the size.  It's big and heavy - the size of a large cell phone but thicker and weighs more like a brick - but that's what you get when you want more power.  I dare a lipstick power bank to match its performance.Make sure to press the power button and hold to start charging.  Other power banks may begin charging the minute anything is plugged in, or they only take a short press of the power button.  This one is different.  Before you think it's defective (like yours truly), press and hold.  Double press the power button and you get the LED flash light.  It's good in a pinch but not really practical.This product was provided for review by Onite.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IKEVZSO" id="B00IKEVZSO-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-10:</strong> When you are looking at a power bank, you look at multiple factors. Key parameters are as follows:- Functionality (what is mAH and how long it takes to charge)- Durability (how durable)- Portability (size, look and feel)In these respects this charger performed very well in all aspects. Packaging is very good and a non-frustration type package. This has TWO USB port and one microUSB port. You connect the USB cable to microUSB and charge the device. You should connect the cable to regular USB and other end to phones/phablets/tablets etc.This power bank comes in a stylish aluminum case. The box comes with a USB cable and also an adapter for iPhone 30 pin. I have charged multiple devices using this- Samsung Galaxy S4 phones- Samsung Galaxy Tab PRO 12.2&#34;The microUSB is used to charge this powerbank and the USB itself to charge other devices. I had no issue charging these with the External Battery power bank. 12000 mAh is strong enough to charge the phones multiple times.Overall excellent value and great powerbank. Just throw it in handbag or backpack and you are all set!

There are other problems too, but I'll start with the long one.If you have it already, and set up your email by following all of the menu prompts, you might like it just fine without realizing what it is actually doing.The way life ought to work, and does on other phones:If you have an IMAP email phone, and an email service which supports IMAP, you get free "push" email (instant delivery, not waiting for the next dial-up) with no extra charge beyond your data plan.  Very simple.Nokia doesn't seem to care.  There is an option for email alerts, but it doesn't seem to actually work unless you agree to the terms of their new "Nokia Messaging" service.  Instead of the phone connecting directly with your email provider (eg, GMail), the phone installs the Nokia application which connects with Nokia's server, and that server at Nokia is actually connected with your email provider.  Not only is this a ghetto work-around, but if you read the terms of the service, it is only free until Nokia decides they are done "testing" it and want to charge you money.So you might be happily using what you think is IMAP push email on this phone, and for all we know it could stop working next month and Nokia could demand that you pay their subscription fee... for something which ought to just work anyway.No pretend that this doesn't matter to you, or you think I am nuts, etc.  On to the next problem.If your email provider has IMAP available, the phone will not allow you to set it to download whole email messages.  The setting option which allows either "headers only" or header+body when you use POP3 is neutered when you have an IMAP server address, and the only option is headers only.  So if you look at your phone and see several new emails, every time you click on it you have to wait for it to connect and load the email.  My SonyEricsson w595 is not so stupid.  I have instant IMAP delivery, and get the body text automatically.So forget about the email client, what about other Internet applications?Here's two problems with that stuff:1. You can't turn off the menu option which stupidly asks if you really want to allow a web browser to access the Internet... every single time you use it.  Other phones at least skip this if you installed a signed application (eg, Opera or Bolt browsers).  The popup has no "never ask" option, and there is no setting for it from the application manager either.  Only Nokia's own browser is exempt.2. The fancy e63 also lets you select an "access point" every time you do something which requires Internet access.  This would be a great feature if you use both WiFi and cellular, and want to switch back and forth all the time.  But it's a total annoyance if you don't.  The e63 lets you turn this "feature" off for its own web browser, but it still does it for everything else.  Google maps, Bolt browser, GMail application... every one makes you select the access point every time you use it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0020NGY78" id="B0020NGY78-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-01:</strong> This is just a great phone, still works after 3 years of heavy use, the only thing I found not great is the keyboard, but the rest is nice.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0020NGY78" id="B0020NGY78-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-04-14:</strong> I recently acquired a couple of Nokia E63 phones and these are my observations so far:Pros* On Mac OS X transfers contacts and calendar through iSync using a plugin downloaded from Nokia* On Mac OS X transfers photos to iPhoto and music to iTunes through Nokia Multimedia Transfer downloaded from Nokia* On Mac OS X transfers both through bluetooth, and USB through USB-to-miniUSB cable using miniUSB-to-microUSB adapter OEM Motorola SKN6252* Uses microSDHC memory; tested using 8GB class 6* Includes FM radio, Internet streaming radio, and plays video and music (aac/mp3)Cons* Mac users, firmware updater only available for Windows* Built-in email program works only over packet radio (provider data plan)* E-mail over WiFi/LAN requires additional application download on the phone and an account with Nokia; setup WiFi access point on the phone first* Does not bundle data cableNote that if you are a techie the cons are minor.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0020NGY78" id="B0020NGY78-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-06-06:</strong> I've always wanted to own a smartphone, but did not want to pay the usurious rates charged by carriers for regular phone+data service. This smartphone is the answer to my wishes. Amazon's hit it out of the park on pricing.The phone hardware is beautifully engineered. While some have panned its camera, I've found it usable. When you first use the keyboard, you might think that with the small keys, you'll fat-finger everything, but surprisingly it works very well. The phone has a plethora of features.I've used my phone with prepaid voice service from T-Mobile. You'll need a SIM card and some airtime. I chose not to buy any data packages, but instead, configure the browser and email to work with wi-fi. The advantage is that wi-fi service at home and many hotels and cafes is free, so you have mobile internet access. The disadvantage is that you don't get mail and web unless you're within range of a wi-fi signal, and you pretty much become your own systems integrator, trying to get all the components to work seamlessly.The manual that comes with the product is close to being useless. It goes on and on about various pieces of jargon, without once explaining what they are, and what purpose they serve. I tried in vain to connect the in-built mail client to Yahoo, but failed because it insists on connecting via IMAP and Yahoo does not do IMAP. There is no way to specify POP. After a day of web browsing I came up on a workaround using a fake email domain name to trick the software into working with Yahoo. You'll have more work to do in setting up the various pieces of software so that they use your wi-fi connection and not the cellular 3G connection.Nokia has a separate push email service that is very poorly documented, and is _separate_ from the email software that comes on the phone. This service works superbly with Yahoo and other email services like Gmail. However figuring out how to change the email icon to start this email as opposed to the stock email program that came with the device takes a good amount of doing. Once you've set it up, you can get it to work so that the email key and icon go directly to the Nokia push email.The bottom line: if you are familiar with setting up electronic gadgetry, know something about various types of networks, and have a day or two to spare in googling, you can set up the phone to work on prepaid, with wi-fi for data service. The hardware is great, and once you've gone past the setup hassles, the software works well.If technology intimidates you, then buy this phone from a carrier, or go for a Blackberry or Iphone. With a phone that you buy from a carrier, you get the carrier to do all the integration with their network, and a number to call if something doesn't work. Of course the downside is the much higher monthly cost.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0020NGY78" id="B0020NGY78-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-08-20:</strong> I am fairly technically oriented -- so tried taking this directly out of the box to use it.  I chose the red phone and the outside cover feels velvety to me.  It doesn't slide around when you set it on a hard surface in the car....which is good.My main complaint is that the written instructions are absolutely useless.  After taking the back off - the cover has a toggle that unlatches in the back and it pivots on a hook at the top of the phone.  Take out the battery and to get your sim card in the phone, slide it VERTICALLY into the little area that looks like you should insert a memory card horizontally.  The guy at the ATT store had to show me how to do this.  Even my 13 year old could not figure it out -- which is generally not a good sign.I agree with other reviewers that the keyboard layout is awesome.  It makes the phone narrower than a BB and is easy to use.  The other trick I had to learn the hard way - is how to unlock the sucker after setting it up with no password.  you have to quickly press in sequence the bar above the green call button and then the function button near the lower left corner of the keyboard.  You can't hold one of the buttons down too long or it ignores you.  When the screen dims, I have a really hard time reading error messages and instructions on the screen.... hmmm.  again, a pain.However, the phone will let you set font size, background color and there is a plethera of pleasing ringtones.  If only the applications were as abundant.I chose this phone because of the wi-fi capabilities.  I do not have a data plan, don't want a data plan, but do need the calendar and email functions.  I can sync and read email at any starbucks and still avoid the overpriced ATT data service.If you still think this is a US phone, read the manual and screen where it instructs you to hold the space bar down for 2-3 seconds to use the phone as a torch (flashlight).  I have actually found this functionality to be VERY useful and even when you don't charge your phone for 3 - 4 days, it will still light up like a beacon in the dark.  Try going 24 hours without charging your  BB bold!bottom line, I would buy it again for the wi-fi and great sound transmission (both out and in).  I love the size, but wish it came with useful user docs.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0020NGY78" id="B0020NGY78-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-11:</strong> when i bought it in sept 2010 it was the phone i was waitng for. and i am to say it is still work up to know. cause i did resell it to a relative who still uses it alot. only thing i did not like at the time was that it tend to be slow and the picture quality from the camera was very poor.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B0020NGY78', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B0020NGY78', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B001YSI04A</h2>    <p class="price"> $B001YSI04A</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

So for the normal person that is use to the standard Ipod ear buds they are going to sound great. The second grips is if I have my device on my hip the sound cuts out sometimes when i'm working out but if I just set it on a bench or on the floor under the gym I can walk around about a 25ft radius with no problem, kinda odd but it's cool.

The SRS WOW built into the headphones makes music sound soooo much better. My only wish is that they blocked out environmental noise a little better, but maybe it will be a side benefit that i can listen to music while riding my bike and not have all sound totally eliminated, just wish it had better sound isolation for wearing em on the subway, but i guess that's okay.UPDATE: (One day later)..The headphones no longer have stereo sound. After chatting with Motorola I have to send them in, they are defective, I didn't accidentally hit a mono button, they are defective and have to go back after only one day! I did nothing to them except charge them overnight and leave them sitting on a shelf. I have no idea how a product could break like this. I've never had an experience like this before.

I said in a review of those that I was going to try the Jaybird's, but I liked the S9's so much that I decided to try the S9 HD's instead.  I had read that the S9 HD's were much improved in sweat resistance.  Not true.On the positive, I will say there is no comparison between the S9's and the S9 HD's as far as sound quality.  The HD's simply blow the older model away.  I was very happy with them initially, although I was so paranoid after my earlier short lived experience, that I found myself CONSTANTLY wiping the headphones off to make sure they didn't get wet while working out.  Well, even that didn't work.  Sadly after only 3 workouts, these too have failed.  This time the headphones themselves still function, as well as the volume controls, however the pause, phone, and forward/back controls have all failed.  Sigh...I really do want to like these headphones, but they are obviously not an appropriate product if you want to use them for workouts.  At least they had the decency to fail within the 30 day return period!This time I actually did order the Jaybirds instead.  I know they don't have the same audio quality as these do, but hopefully they will function for over a week!UPDATE:  I looked at my review this morning, and decided that I was too harsh in rating these 1 star (although I can't go back and change that).  They really are very good as far as sound quality, and if you aren't using them for workouts, then you will probably really like them.  It's just the only time I ever use headphones is during workouts, so for me at least they are unacceptable.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001YSI04A" id="B001YSI04A-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-10-26:</strong> Very portable, connects easily, relatively comfortable.

I finally started using these again hoping I could cope with the worst bluetooth range I have ever seen to date, and sorry, I can't take it.Pros:The sound quality is great. It's some of the best I've ever had for Bluetooth Headphones.I haven't had sweat problems at the gym like other people seem to have had.They are very lightweight, although it would be nicer if it was lower so you could lay down with them on.Cons:The rubber glue holding the power button rubber unglued itself.The battery life is about 5 hours... not bad for the size, but not really that great either.Motorola technical support is some of the worst ever conceived, it's a joke to even call it that.They bend pretty easy - if you take these on a road trip, make sure they don't have /any/ weight on them. Mine bent to the left pretty heavy and took some time to bend back.But the real meat and potatoes is that THESE HAVE THE WORST WIRELESS RANGE IN THE HISTORY OF WIRELESS.I have to put my phone in my hood to get the sound to not cut out nonstop. Pockets? Sorry, you are SOL. Like working out? It works, kind of. Biking with your phone in your pocket is a long lost dream. I didn't buy these - My HT820 (which by the way was AMAZING compared to these) went in for warranty, and they sent me these back. No charger, no manual, nothing but these in a box (and they weren't even bubble wrapped!) and then when I contacted them about it, they said my warranty had expired. That might be due to the fact that it TOOK NEARLY 3 WEEKS to get a response. Getting an RMA on my previous set so bad that I am never buying Motorola again.Overall, I really dislike these headphones because there is no practical use. Look at the 1 star reviews, and you'll see what I have.I cannot repeat this enough: DO NOT BUY THESE, SAVE YOURSELF THE HORRORS OF THIS PIECE OF TRASH (for lack of better words)Update: I have upgraded to the Nokia BH-905i - I like BT headphones and I'm not going to throw my money away on another pair of these losers. The sound doesn't cut out on my (new) phone with the new pair - it still does with the old (these). When I did upgrade my phone (from when I wrote the top part of this review), I tested out the BT range, and sadly, the problem did lie in these headphones. I want to like them, but with all of the problems, there is nothing about these to like.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001YSI04A" id="B001YSI04A-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-03-22:</strong> This is the first bluetooth headset that I bought. The first few days it worked ok but I noticed I had to recharge it after every couple of hours that was used. Then I started hearing a lot of static noice (I was not walking around, sitting next to my laptop). Bottom line, don't waste your money, there is a reason this headset was so cheap. Who knows maybe a more expensive one does a better job.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001YSI04A" id="B001YSI04A-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-24:</strong> I am a runner and have been using these headphones for the past four years with different devices on the treadmill in the gym as well as outdoors. Currently I use them with my iPhone 4S, with which this headset paired effortlessly. However I am now on my third headset.After about a year the battery did not seem to be holding a charge, and I got a replacement headset. I see from other reviews that other people have also had some battery issues, though I have no idea how widespread that is.Soon after getting that replacement I started going to a gym where the treadmill area was not well ventilated and tended to be humid. I got drenched in sweat and so did the headset. The volume control stopped working (it was stuck on the highest volume) and there was static coming out of one of the ear buds. Fortunately it was not too late to get another free replacement from the store where I purchased them.I note that all electronic items can be "zapped" by moisture unless they are specifically designed to be water resistant. It appears that this headset is not. It never was an issue for me until I started running indoors at my first gym. I have since switched gyms, and my new gym is well ventilated. I also wear the Buff (which I have reviewed on Amazon) when I run. Since this covers my entire head and is great for absorbing sweat, including sweat on the back of my neck, the sweat is no longer an issue for me.Note: If you want a corded headset to use when sweat will be an issue, I suggest the Sennheiser PMX 70, which I have reviewed on Amazon.In any event, my latest headset has been working just fine for the past three years.Before purchasing this headset, you should keep some things in mind.First, depending on what device you use, it may be necessary to buy a separate blue tooth adapter (I had to do that when I used this headset with an iPod).Second, if you wear glasses, it works best to put the headset on first and the glasses on second. The glasses won't fit quite as snugly as they normally do, but for exercise it will be fine. I found that if I put my sunglasses on first, the headset did not fit as snugly in my ears, with a resulting loss in sound. The same thing applies if you wear a headband or bandana--put the headset on first.Third, since the headset is curved in the back, if you wear anything with a collar that sticks up in the back, the collar will push against the headset, which will come slightly out of its position in your ears. So wearing the headset with a ski jacket won't work very well. With a thinner collar, you will occasionally have to reposition the headset as the collar pushes against it. Also, if you wear a ski hat to run, you will not be able to pull it down over your ears.Fourth, because of the back of the neck design, you will not be able to use this headset comfortably to lay on your back (like on a blanket at the beach, a couch in your den, a chaise lounge by the pool) or to sit in a reclining position with your head back (like in a car or airplane). Likewise you will need to remove it to use certain equipment at the gym, like the situp bench.All in all I am very satisfied with this product now that I have resolved the sweat issue.Update March 17, 2012: I figured out how to use this headset comfortably to lay on my back. Turn the headset upside down (So the M now looks like a W), put it in back of your head, and put the earbuds into your ears without looping anything over your hears like you usually do. The back of the headset will now be flush against your neck, and you can comfortably lay back on a beach chair etc. Keep in mind that now the phone button and volume controls will be on your right ear instead of your left ear. I can't believe that I didn't think of this sooner.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B001YSI04A', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B001YSI04A', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00GY6X9RK</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00GY6X9RK</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

I ordered blue so sometimes I have a hard time finding my phone coz its too black LOL</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GY6X9RK" id="B00GY6X9RK-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-09:</strong> Pros:- Fits the Moto G like a glove, all the proper cutouts in the right places, no ports or or buttons are blocked (including charging, mic, and headphones)- Premium feel (looks good and doesn't feel cheap), nice texture for holding (I got the matte white, can't see fingerprints on it which is a bonus) and the manufacturer logo on the back is small and light grey so isn't very noticeable.- The inside of the case itself is very smooth (no seam or sharp edges).  Combined with the great fit of the case, I can't see this case scratching your phone accidentally because of any loose fittings.- Mine came with a free screen protector that was quite decent (rigid, dry apply variety) and fits the screen dimensions.Cons:- The biggest con, and if you're looking at a slim minimalist case you may not even care, is that ~50% of the corners of the phone are not covered by the case.  Since it's a single-piece, rigid plastic design they probably had to do it to allow for the phone to slide in and out.  Unfortunately, since most cases of screen shatter result in phones dropping on their corners this reduces the amount of protection.  If you don't drop your phone, this is arguably one of the best slim-line cases short of putting just a skin on your phone.- Putting the case on is easy and quick.  Taking the case off, if you like to switch cases a lot (I do), is a bit of a pain.  Like I said, it's a snug, good fit, so I struggled quite a bit in prying it out of the case without damaging it or the phone.  I tried multiple ways and even watched a video that the manufacturer had put out (for a different phone with slightly different cutouts but the same design essentially) and it's still a pain.Neutral:-There are some small seams from the molding process on the outside of the case, but none on the inside.  They are not sharp and wouldn't be noticeable unless you held it near your face.- It's 100% rigid plastic, no softer coating or rubberized interior.  I knew it when I purchased the case so it's not a complaint, but just in case people want to know.  Adding a second soft layer would add bulk to the case which is why probably why they left it out.Conclusion:All in all, it's a really nice case for the low price (at time of purchase it was ~$10).  If you dislike TPU because of the way it gathers dust bunnies and prefer a rigid & minimal case, this is a good contender.  If you're paranoid about dropping your phone and prefer more robust and bulkier cases, you may want to look elsewhere.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GY6X9RK" id="B00GY6X9RK-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-10:</strong> This case fits fantastic and looks great. I appreciate that it leaves the side buttons exposed, rather than cover them (and have to push through rubber or plastic).It adds very little bulk to the phone, but know that the tradeoff is minimal protection. It will keep scratches off the back and sides, you can lay the phone screen down and the screen won't touch the surface. But if you are prone to drop the phone, it is only going to protect from very minor ones.I recommend it if you understand what you are getting.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GY6X9RK" id="B00GY6X9RK-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-23:</strong> I love this case!

This is by far, my favorite brand for smartphone cases, without any doubt.Both my wife and I own Nexus 4 with Ringke cases and we just loved them. A few weeks ago we purchased a Moto G for our nephew and, of course, we included a properly Ringke case for it. Compared to our Nexus 4 cases, the Moto G case is way much better and almost perfect:Materials feel much better than the Nexus 4 case and it has a much softer surface and rounded corners that are really awesome to touch and hold. Also, somehow this material left less fingerprints than our Nexus 4 cases. So far, this case has 5 stars.As with any Ringke case, they are very hard (my Nexus 4 has survived 2 drops to the floor from the table, without a single scratch) and also very thin and elegant (they really don't add any bulk to the phone).My 4 star review it's because a very small detail: the front corners need to be a little &#34;taller&#34; or &#34;thicker&#34;, so when placing the phone face down the screen is more separated from the table (as it is with the Nexus 4 case). That said: adding +1 or 2 mm to the corners will help the Moto G screen last longer without a scratch, but this is just an issue for people like me, who uses Gravity Screen On/Off and puts the phone face down against the table in order to sleep the screen (most people keep the phone face up). Nevertheless, the corners do separate the screen from the surface when placing the pone face down, but I just thing it's not enough. That small change and I'll definitely rate it 5 star.The plus feature about this case is that includes a free screen protector, but as the Moto G comes with Gorilla Glass 3 (which is virtually unscratchable for a common everyday use, same as our Nexus 4), we haven't installed it yet and probably we won't do it anyway... but for those who feel they need the extra protection it's a great deal and you'll save a few bucks.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GY6X9RK" id="B00GY6X9RK-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-02:</strong> Great quality !</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GY6X9RK" id="B00GY6X9RK-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-08:</strong> Case is great. more gold, less champagne than on my screen.

It's like a wallet or Checkbook cover case for a smart phone. I was a little leery trusting it tohold my phone, to grip it & not let it fall out. After a couple days of careful uses, I could see I had nothing to be concerned about. The hard &#34;plastic&#34; frame holds a Moto G realiably. I particularly like the cover that flips over the display. I do not like having the smart phone display exposed in my pocket! This case ends that issue! I gave up on trying to find a practical envelope type case for a smartphone with a case. I always used flap cases for flip phones and never felt comfortable carrying a stick phone without one.This case is the bees knees for me. Its a case & envelope case in one and its very practical, an excellent fit and a good protector!The only negative for some people is the bulk, which is partly the phones width (4.5&#34; display) and partly this &#34;notebook: case. I ama broad shouldered man, yet the phone and flip case is a tight fit for my shirt pocket. I still like it very much though. My hands & fingers are too large to work a 4.5&#34; touchscreen. I cannot dial. A loop to hold my slim stylus would be nice.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GY6X9RK" id="B00GY6X9RK-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-05:</strong> thin, light and provides very good protection for the phone.

So if your phone falls down it can't save the top and bottom edge to get dent or break as the phone itself is simply made of plastic. So it's good for protecting the back and Front glass. Not the entire phone or all edges. It's nice in color and fit's perfectly on phone. The case itself is not scratch resistant. It makes scratches on the case itself even if it's kept on desk or any other surface. So it protects your front and back phone but don't protect edges of dent or break if it falls down and case itself from scratches.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GY6X9RK" id="B00GY6X9RK-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-08:</strong> These are tough phone cases.

I got this to replace the stock antenna that came with the booster. I never tried the stock antenna, but I will at some point, just to see what the difference is. In Yellowstone, where I spend a lot of time, it is now a matter of the few areas I don't have coverage, whereas before, it was a matter of figuring out what few areas I had some coverage, at least enough to make a phone call. With this, I've been able to set my phone as a WI-FI hotspot and use my iPad, or MacBook Pro. Highly recommended if you are using the booster this is intended for.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0018PS4O0" id="B0018PS4O0-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-23:</strong> This antenna works so well with the Wilsonsleek signal booster.

I had originally placed my 3G Broadband device inside the Wilson Sleek (designed for cell phones), using the original mini-antenna. However, that antenna was a little too weak to pick up signals in the deserts of California.  So, I purchased this antenna and replaced the other one.  I use this antenna inside my RV near a window.  I have this antenna magnetically stuck to a Coleman metal camping plate/dish (used as a plane).  Its working just fine, and picking up 2 more bars!  Now, I can use my ROKU box without all the buffering. So, this antenna actually worked for me, and I was very skeptical at first. Also, the metal camping dish/plate works well as an inductor. I tried a metal cup and other metal objects but the metal plate works wonders!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0018PS4O0" id="B0018PS4O0-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-18:</strong> The magnet sticks well.

It not only protects my phone, it keeps two credit cards and or one credit card and a driver's license with no problem.When going out, first of all, who needs to carry a thick leather wallet anymore like my grandpa?  Usually, it's only one card or two that I use, a business card and a personal card.  Usually the business card can double for tax purposes.  But nonetheless, you only need one or two cards.Since this case is made for an iphone, wouldn't or shouldn't you have an app to keep all the vital info on the other cards that clutter your wallet?This case is not only better than the more expensive ones I have found on Amazon that can run into the $40s and $60s dollar range but the question is WHY?  This thing cost a few bucks, if it gets ruined, buy another one.  Big deal.All the other reviews about &#34;Well, it's not real leather!&#34; and &#34;It won't close properly...&#34;  Well, use it for awhile and it closes just fine.  Maybe it's not real leather, big deal! It was freakin' a $5.00 iphone case! You couldn't go to your local ANY TECH store and buy an iphone case for less than $10.00 dollars now, and it's usually a Hello Kitty close out sale!Buy the case, in fact, buy two or three and give it out to any business associates you know that need iphone case with a built in business card carrier.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006HDABKI" id="B006HDABKI-review37" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-30:</strong> For the price you really cant go wrong.

Both styles are great, and each has different advantages. I prefer this Nanum case because it exposes the tablet nicely when the case is opened, and I can easily remove it completely if I want.  It is an exceptional value for the price, and the blue one I received is a very nice color (more subdued than what is shown in the photos).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009S40LDA" id="B009S40LDA-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-21:</strong> First off, the stylus that comes with the case is a lot of fun to use, but it has kind of a low construction quality, so don't expect it to last too long. Secondly, and more importantly, the case was of good quality. It did, however, take a little while to figure out how to actually use it as a stand. It came pretty stiff, and I didn't realize I was supposed to bend the back of it back to get it to be used as a stand. That was my fault though. After a little while, the clips that hold the tablet at the bottom (when it's in landscape) loosen up a lot, and make it a lot easier to use. It's hard to manage at first though, and takes a few weeks to break it in. There's a really hard clip that holds the case close around the tablet, and I don't really like it. At the same time, I don't know of another way to effectively hold it closed, so I can't really say much. If you use this case for a while, you'll eventually notice the paint on the bezel of the tablet starting to wear off, so keep an eye out for that.I do really like that it will act as a stand for two different angles, and very relevant angles at that. I do like it, overall, and it served me well while taking the tablet to and from class to take notes on.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009S40LDA" id="B009S40LDA-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-06:</strong> First thing to make clear, in the picture shown the case looked a like brighter blue than it actually is... It's really almost navy. That ignored, the case could best be described as a "you get what you pay for" sort of item.Until I received this case, I'd been using a Kindle Fire case with the exact same design (Vuscape by Targus) on my Nexus 7. That case was more padded and the case material was a bit softer. The upside to not having that padding is that this case is a tad bit slimmer... I don't know if that means there's less protection or if it matters at all. The inside material is pretty generic. The speaker has openings on the back and the microphones are clear. The case fits around the buttons well too.For it's low price, it does a great job protecting the screen and acting as a stand. While standing, you can use as much force as you wish to type, swipe, and press. Unlike the ipad style, folding smart cover design, where the upright standing mode is prone to falling over with anything more than light pressing. I would say this is one of the best designs for people that actually need to type on their devices in standing mode.The sleep/awake function in this case works perfectly, and the sensor does not get confused when the cover is open and pulled around, a common issue with other cases with the sleep/awake functionality.The case would probably be good for a 4/5 star rating but the "Blue" shown isn't accurate to what's being sent out.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009S40LDA" id="B009S40LDA-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-27:</strong> I would definitely recommend this to anyone needing protection for their Nexus 7.

I expected the case to come with a smooth black finish. Instead, it came with an even better carbon fiber look to it. I love it.The corners are pretty strong and hold the tablet in place. Time will though. My dad has a similar case for his kindle fire HD and the bottom no longer holds well due to switching to the landscape multiview position so often. The bottom right corner in landscape mode is very tight on this case. When taking it off, it nearly separates the back cover from the glass. But no complaints here, its a tight fit and don't plan on removing it a lot. Couldn't figure out what the elastic band was for in front but it may be to hold the case together when in portrait mode. I wrap it over the tablets glass, then pull the middle down to the closing latch so only the corners are a little covered by the strap. Hope that makes sense.Great case overall!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009S40LDA" id="B009S40LDA-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-31:</strong> The color I received does not match the color showing online.

I wanted something retractable and small...and this seemed to fit the bill. But it sometimes has a mind of its own...PRO:1, compact. Like the fact that the plug folds down and the cord retracts into the unit.CON:We have Android phones (Samsung and Motorola--both brands stated in the post), and when it is plugged in to charge, it does a couple of things.  It started out fine, but after about the 6th use it got all weird on me:1, on the Samsung (Galaxy 2) it freezes the main screen, and cooks the battery as it charges. And I mean COOK. Like you have just taken a torch to it.  I know that batteries heat when they charge, but wow, this seemed like it was damaging the phone;2, on the Motorola (Droid X), it turned on my g-Talk screen and sent the weirdest string of letters, symbols, and numbers as a message---all night long as it charged.  2 different friends woke up to these bizarre messages that were HUNDREDS if not THOUSANDS of characters long. And the phone wasn't even ON! I always turn the phone off (granted, not to 'power off' mode) when I plug the phone in to charge.  It also cooks the battery.3, it doesn't charge everything with a micro USB--thought it would charge my Nook and Kindle, but it won't.Not sure about this one, to be honest.  I think as it ages, it gets funky.  It concerns me of the heat it generates in the phone batteries...maybe opting out of convenience and just getting another charger for the phones would be the best thing.  The phones and/or batteries are far more expensive to replace than the cost of this 'convenience charger'.  Maybe for a first use or a very short use it would be fine, but I'm guessing that it has a short shelf life.I won't be buying another.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002BPFLCY" id="B002BPFLCY-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-24:</strong> i love this charger, it just sits there all nice and neat until you need it. i can throw it in my purse or even in my pocket it's so small.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002BPFLCY" id="B002BPFLCY-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-13:</strong> Works great with my phone and the retractable button is a nice touch.But be warned if you have large hands the retracting part can pop you in the finger if your not careful.Aside from that it a great little charger.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002BPFLCY" id="B002BPFLCY-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-26:</strong> Used this device successfully for about two weeks before the prongs broke off the end that attaches to the phone.

I am very pleased with it's performance. If you're looking for a great external battery with tons of power, this is the one to get.I'm not exactly sure when I bought this product, but it has single-handedly changed the way I use my mobile devices. It's 12000 mAh capacity is perfect for those, like me, who are always connected on at least one device.I bought this product primarily because I always find myself with a low battery and no outlet in sight. I travel on public transportation and I don't know the systems so I use Google maps to get around. I also use my phone to tether when my school's wifi quits.Exterior:No buttons and a beautiful LED ring to let you know how much juice you have left. Each ring is approximately 10%, so you're not left to guess with 4 or 5 LEDs. The shake to wake feature is very sensitive but I keep the battery in my bag most of the time and I haven't noticed any loss of power from it. The soft touch material on the exterior is very elegant and I appreciate the design.Performance:I'm no battery tester but I can tell this product is efficient. It's charged my iPhone 5s 6 times from absolutely dead -with more juice left- on just one charge. It charges my phone rapidly, maybe two hours tops in the smart port. It also charged my phone, kindle, and beats at the same time. I am very pleased.Amenities:I only got the battery, a case (which is not at all cheap), and a short (6in is my best guess) micro-USB to USB cable for charging. You will need your own USB to wall charger, but if you have any devices to use the battery with you'll have something laying around. I didn't receive a longer cord or any iPhone wire when I purchased, contrary to other reviews.All in all, this is the perfect device for the tech-obsessed person or the unfortunate souls who can never seem to find an outlet. I recommend this product.Please note that I did not review this product for any gain, I did not receive any product for free or discount nor any financial incentive. These are my opinions and my opinions only.PREVIOUS REVIEW: The Anker Astro3 is a great great product and has helped me, as a student, remain efficient.The Astro3 is beautiful. It's smooth, doesn't have obnoxious branding, and feels great to hold. It is not that heavy, and fits great into my bag.The large battery (12000 mAh) charges all my devices (AT THE SAME TIME, TOO!) andI have a smaller Anker battery that looks like lipstick, and I gave that to my mom when I got this product. Don't get me wrong, that works great too, but I realized that I'd rather a larger battery.I have noticed that the "shake-to-activate" is very sensitive, but if it's set off and not connected to any devices it doesn't stay on and serves just as a charge percentage indicator.I love that Anker used 10 LED's because it makes it easy to recognize the charge. 3 lights? 30%! Easy and well designed. I also really like the case they gave me! My Astro rarely leaves its little pocket, and if you put it in with the ports up you won't ever have to take it out!I cannot attest to the actual mAh in the battery, but neither can most people. It charges my phone tons of times, and I've even had it in my bed plugged into my phone overnight. It charged my iPhone up to 100%, and since I bounced around all night it kept it there. However, I didn't notice any significant battery drain, and the Astro3 charged up my beats, kindle, and iPad before dying. I'm very satisfied and I would DEFINITELY recommend this product!Edit: Forgot to add that I use this product almost solely with the AmazonBasics 4 inch Lightning cable, and it works like a charm! It keeps my bag from becoming cluttered. I'm very very happy with it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CEZBKTO" id="B00CEZBKTO-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-04:</strong> I bought this for my son-in-law who has an iPad and iPhone.

The ones I find the most reliable are the Anker batteries.  I like this model in particular because of the smart port which can give a higher amperage charge.  The only downside I have found is the slow speed (over 9 hours for me) to recharge this battery pack.  Based on negative experiences with other companies like New Trent, I only purchase batteries with longer warranties like the Anker.  Anker has an 18 month warranty.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CEZBKTO" id="B00CEZBKTO-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-27:</strong> I just bought two of these batteries last week and had the chance to use them over the weekend. I'm very pleased. They do what they promised. Thanks to PowerIQ, they can charge any device on any port, rather than having to put Apple devices in some ports and Androids in others for best charging efficiency -- I've always felt I was getting only half the use out of those devices. My only wish for these batteries would be for the output to match the number of ports at full speed (2.4 * 3 = 7.2amps out shared among the three ports), as the total amps shared by the three ports is 5.I have an app on my android tablet that tells me what my amps are coming in when I plug the device into a charger. When I've used ports that were designated for Apple, even though the port was rated at 2.1 to 2.4 amps, it would read lower coming in than the Android port that was was listed as 1.0 to 1.2 amps. With these batteries, I get the same amps on every port.I'm also very pleased with the capacity, although I did consider going with a bigger battery. I stayed with these batteries because of their ability to be charged using USB. The larger batteries had to be charged with using direct power. My aim is to be able to use solar panels with USB output to charge the batteries when I travel. It's a lot more versatile to be able to charge the batteries, rather than the devices, using solar panels, with the main point being able to keep my sensitive devices out of the sun when charging. And Anker appears to have the best USB solar panel out there right now -- although it doesn't say it has the PowerIQ ports yet.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CEZBKTO" id="B00CEZBKTO-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-15:</strong> I use this for camping and it'll keep my nexus 7/kindle paperwhite/phone charged up and ready to go for weekend camping trips!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CEZBKTO" id="B00CEZBKTO-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-02:</strong> This is another nice and quality product. Since there are so many good reviews, I don't think I need to belabor the plus points, other than pointing out the fact its form factor makes it easier to carry it with my smartphone around, when my phone's battery is running low. I does feel a bit heavy because of the bigger battery capacity. But it would definitely beats the other two Anker models (9000mAh & 6000mAh). Being able to provide 2A on all ports are critical, too, because I usually need to charge the bluetooth headset.I took a few issues with the product, based on my experience after using it for weeks. My chief comparison is with the first-gen TYLT charger that I have carried for a long time.http://www.amazon.com/PowerPlant-Universal-Portable-Battery-MicroUSB/dp/B00J5MID3K/First, the main disappointment is that it cannot charge any device when itself is being charged. This is a big disappointment that affects how you use the product. Think about the fact that it takes more than a few hours to fully charge the device, my natural inclination is to charge this overnight. Yet, I could not throw away my other chargers since I could not keep charging my devices at the same time. What I end up doing is to charge my devices using TYLT overnight, when the Anker battery is re-juiced at the same time, so that I can wake up with everything fully charged.Second, the white LED is too bright. It shines brightly on the ceiling at night when it is charged facing up. Because it pulsating the brightness during charging, it could interfere with sleep for someone.Thirdly, it comes with one charging USB cable. I would hoped that it came with four, so that I don't have to fish around to use my older cables. It is well known that USB cables tend to wear out (especially those micro-USB connectors). When they do, charging performance deteriorates significantly. The supplied cable feels tight when plugged in, and it charges fast. So I have reason to assume that it is a high-quality cable. I would hoped that it came with a bunch. I would not mind if I paid a few bucks more for that convenience, since this price range of this product has already made it into the premium product category.In summary, I am carrying this as my go-to battery when I'm out and about. But I cannot depend on it for charging my devices overnight, because I need to make sure both my devices and this battery is fully charged the next morning.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CEZBKTO" id="B00CEZBKTO-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-23:</strong> Great cost, great construction, and powerful.

I have charged my iPhone 5s 4x, a Samsung S3 twice, an iPad2 and Galaxy Note II all without having to re-charge the Astro3 (going on 1 week now; I have purposely not re-charged it and have been using it for everything to see how long one charge would last). The unit is built like a brick; well constructed, visually pleasing, great non-slip outer finish/gloss-black sides and the power indicator/light is a great feature. Don't know how much power you have left? Give the Astro3 a &#34;shake&#34; and it displays the power available. Amazing.Comes with a carrying case, although the case (very similar to a sunglasses &#34;bag&#34;) is a tight fit and does not have enough room for the charging cable. That is the only negative I have found and is not enough to lower my 5-star rating.I charged an iPhone 5s, iPad 2 and Samsung S3 (all with less than 20% battery life remaining) all at once and the Astro3 fully-charged all 3 and still had power in reserve (about 1/4 remaining).This is a great product and I highly recommend this unit...with 3 USB ports and so much power, I think I could go 5-7 days with a full charge if I was traveling and never run out of battery life on my iPhone 5s while using the phone regularly.

This one can't even charge my Nexus 7 twice. One charge from 10% to full and the battery pack was down to 3 bars which is enough to charge my Evo LTE from 50% to full once.  They claim 6 to 7 charges for most phones, they aren't talking about today's smart phones with huge battery's. I'd be lucky to get 4 charges from empty on My Evo. 6 to 7 charges if I only let it get down to 50% maybe. It will get you through a weekend. The "smart" port... Charges my Nexus 7 (2012)  super slowwww. The other ports charge fine.  When plugged into the smart port it says 8 hours until charged from 70%!!! Plug into the other port and it changes to 1 hour and instantly starts going up.  The shake to wake seems to do nothing also, like even if you don't shake it and just plug something in it starts charging. Shake to wake also causes it to turn on and off any time you move it in the slightest.

Don't worry the dial that shows you how much is left used miniscule power, or as it says in the manual it would take 1,000,000 shakes to use up the battery.Having three charging ports is great when I travel with an iphone and an iPad.12,000 mAh is a phenomenal amount if battery power that lasts through multiple charging cycles of my devices, and since it lives in my backpack and doesn't get used everyday the battery should last me a while before it requires a recharge.My only wish, and this is for ANY addon device, would be to have a lightning plug input option for charging so that I don't have to carry around a micro USB and my iphone lightning cable.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CEZBKTO" id="B00CEZBKTO-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-19:</strong> I got this for my wife after we went on a trip to florida and her phone kept needing to be charged, a girl on the plane next to us had one and I took pics of it and found it on amazon she loved hers too, it will charge my wifes iphone 5 at least a half dozen times before needing an overnight plug in via usb but she now carries it in her work bag and uses it often while she is out and on the go.Next vacation I see it coming in very handy as well so this time she can charge her phone up in all those places with no outlet access.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CEZBKTO" id="B00CEZBKTO-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-15:</strong> Product arrived fully charged but now I can not carge it using any charger at all.

I no longer need to be tethered to a wall outlet during the work day which was EXTREMELY annoying.  I keep this bad boy in my briefcase and have even offered juice to others while charging myself.  A STEAL of a deal at $50 here on Amazaon.  Just check the other brick and motar stores, or even some of the cellphone online retailers, and you wont find a better bang for your buck.In sum, I cannot recommend this product enough.

Considering how much power it holds, it's fairly lightweight and compact.It's 12000mAh capacity was enough to charge my iPhone5s over four time, and the fact that it's got three ports allows you to charge multiple devices while on the go.This particular model has three ports:1x &#34;Smart&#34; port that provides 2.4A and optimizes for whatever device to plug in to it.2x &#34;Universal&#34; ports that provide 2A.The Smart port will provide the fastest charges for both phones and Tablets, but the Universal ports still provide a charge that is plenty fast. The 12000mAh pack itself is charged by using a microUSB cable (included), you'll need to plug it into either an AC USB adapter, or into your computer. A 1.5A adapter is recommended and would result in a ~8-9 hour charging time from 0-Full while charging the pack with your computer would take over a day.Once you've plugged in your devices, give the Anker pack a little shake to begin charging. The LED ring in the middle will indicate  how much power remains in the battery pack. It's a cool little design.I was provided this product to review and share my honest opinion/feedback.That being said, I have no complaints about this product and think it's a great buy.It's very competitively priced, and works very well.You don't realize how useful being able to charge your phone or tablet without a nearby outlet is until you've got used to it!Highly recommended.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CEZBKTO" id="B00CEZBKTO-review23" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-19:</strong> I did a great deal of research while trying to decide upon a good external travel charger.

Why did I buy the Astro3 12000mAh External Battery? Two reasons - (1) additional power is always a good thing because (2) my kids tend to steal my cool stuff, like batteries (I guess I raised them right!). It's very sleek to the touch; a trend I'm noticing in recent Anker products. Three ports, including a "Smart Port" which just doesn't care what you plug in (Apple or Android), it will recharge it. It's not that large or heavy and can stand upright if needed. There are no external buttons, which leads to my only criticism. I understand minimalism, but I really don't like the "shake to wake" requirement. It's a little silly - I just hope I don't accidentally throw it at someone during a shake! Also, I really liked the flashlight on the Astro E4 13000mAh and wish the Astro3 12000mAh had one as well.

This is more of a personal preferences nit pick, but It might be good for someone who has arthritis and doesn't want to &#34;shake&#34; it, it's just a wee but on the sensitive side I think.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CEZBKTO" id="B00CEZBKTO-review36" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-10:</strong> Pros:- 2A charging means this thing charges fast!- Somehow they made an external battery look sexy.- Can charge my Galaxy S4 about 6 times, which is fantastic.Cons:- Does not come with a charging cable for the device itself.- To turn it on you have to give it a shake, who came up with that idea?</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CEZBKTO" id="B00CEZBKTO-review37" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-11:</strong> This thing is great.

I almost prefer a button in this case. This charger is almost always in that CD pouch in my backpack or in a side pocket of my duffel bag. I thought if I just leave the cable connected, I could just plug my phone in and give my bag a shake. Unfortunately, it takes a really hard shake of the bag to get it going, so I like look like a big goof standing in the locker room shaking the crap out of my bag.Other than the shake to wake feature, i really like this charger. The matte black feel is great and scratch resistant. The 3 ports is very useful since I charge my iPhone, iPad, and my GoPro Hero3 all at once a lot. Pair this with a solar charger and this setup got me through a 4 day camping trip without an outlet! in that time, I charged my iPhone 4s twice, her iPhone 4s twice, my iPad once, and my GoPro about 8-9 times.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CEZBKTO" id="B00CEZBKTO-review43" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-26:</strong> I have a few different chargers, each good for different things.

I purchased the 2nd Gen Astro3 as a backup charger for my Samsung Galaxy S4 in case of emergencies, natural disasters, etc.  I decided to test this unit to see how many times it would charge my phone, so I first fully charged the Astro3, then ran the Galaxy S4 (2600 maH battery) down to 5% remaining charge each time and recharged it with the Astro3 until the phone was at 100%.  I was able to get the S4 to the 100% level three times, and on the fourth, to 74%.  Anker states in it's description that the Astro3 will charge &#34; large-capacity phones like the Galaxy S4 almost four times&#34;, so that appears to be a fair claim, and an excellent result.  Each full charge from 5% to 100% took about 1 hour and 50 minutes using the included 5 pin micro USB cable.  The Astro3 looks, feels, and performs like a high quality product, and IMHO is a great value as well.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CEZBKTO" id="B00CEZBKTO-review45" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-09:</strong> This battery works great and the LED charge level meter is so much more helpful from past models.

Also charges the iPad Air, iPhone 5, etc., and importantly, it has an indicator to tell you remaining charge. Very well designed, and the highest power storage capacity which I've found in browsing both Amazon and the Net for portable power supplies.Would highly recommend this, and I  have tried three other types of portable power sources.

I wish i had discovered this a long time ago.  This is the big brother to the 6000mAH model and it will output a total of 4 amps.  It takes a couple of hours to fully charge but that's to be expected.  It's rated to charge a galaxy S4 5 full times before it runs out of juice.  I haven't had a chance to test that specific claim, but on a trip it charged my S4, a nexus 5, and 2 iphones fully with about 25% life remaining on the charger.  Best money i've ever spent.

Small and sleek its easy to stick in a pocket or in a bag.  Charging times are not fantastic, but it get the job done.  My iPhone charges much faster while plugs into a wall, but a lot slower than this while plugged into my car.  The only downside as some people might suggest is that with every little movement the light circle lights up.  As a result, if you are walking or have this in a backpack the light circle will continually stay on.  As far as I can tell it has not affected the battery life, but I've only had a couple weeks.

Technically, it exceeds their lithium-ion battery capacity limit if you look on the TSA web site. But... if you read that page carefully, it really sounds like it is up to the TSA agents to decide what to do. They didn't even pause when my backpack went through.It's very cool looking. The lack of buttons is pretty neat. My only complaint is that it lights up all the time. When you move it just a little, it lights up. This could give the impression that it turns on all the time and cause concern, for example, with TSA.

With the iPad 3 battery capacity being around 11,600 mAh,  this equates to about a 27% loss through conversion, much lower efficiency than is advertised.I'm also getting less iPhone 5 charges than other users at 5 full charges, which is still good, btw. It has 3 charging ports, (one of them intelligent) whereas most batteries in this class only have 2, and bridged ones at that.Fit and finish are excellent - rubber coating provides good grip and the carrying bag is a nice padded mesh pocket.For me, the Shake to charge/status is a mixed bag, as it is a novel idea, but I'm wondering how much energy is wasted by the indicator getting lit up while getting bumped all day in your bag or pocket.It was a nice surprise that the micro-USB to 30-pin adapter was included, however it is so small that I can see it getting lost very easily. Also, the short USB to micro USB cable gets very HOT when charging that battery itself, even using  Anker's which leads to the next critique, that of charging time. It was good that Anker did not include some cheap cube power adapter, as charging from one of those would be glacially slow. Plugged into Anker's own 18w 3.6A charger, it still took longer than expected to charge the battery from dead, at approximately 10-12 hours.Pros:* 3 charging ports,1 intelligent, simultaneous charging of all three* Fit and finish* 10-segment charge statusCons:* Wasted energy from shake to charge/status* Only 1 cord/tip  included* Can't charge and use battery at the same time* Slow charging of battery itselfOverall, I like this battery a lot, though I'm reluctant to give it a full 5 stars based on some of the performance that I've seen so far.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CEZBKTO" id="B00CEZBKTO-review70" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-07:</strong> It's so great having this portable battery.

If you are looking for several recharges (at least on phones and some tablets) and the ability to charge multiple devices then this portable battery will leave you very pleased. The "Smart" USB port apparently charges at the maximum amps possible for your device so it charges my phone (Galaxy Nexus) VERY quickly. I kind of want to say that it almost seems to charge my phone faster than a normal power outlet, but I am not sure that is possible.If I had to think of "negatives"... It's kind of bigger, but I bought it for it's charging capacity. Most other 12000 mAh batteries are about the same size. This one at least looks sleek and delivers. Also it doesn't have a built in cable, but it DOES come with a mesh case that I didn't know about from reading the description. Included was a short micro usb to USB cable as well that works fine for my phone.I did shop around a bit before buying this... at least virtually shopped. There are some good alternatives that might be the same cost or save you some money, but I think what the alternatives lack is 3 ports and the 4A total charging capability. I saw one or two other units that had other perks like being waterproof and maybe slightly lighter, but they lacked the AMPS and/or number of ports of this device.Find what works for you, but I don't think you will be unhappy with this.Oh, and I did email Anker since I was concerned about there being no power switch and how that would affect it coming on constantly. They wrote back very promptly and said that the device would come on occasionally, but the amount of power used would be EXTREMELY low as long as there was no device connected that was charging.

The Aker website has a message-board where you can ask about your specific product if you are not sure[...]This item will only charge 5 volt devices.The 2nd Gen Astro3 has three (3) USB ports that you can use at the same time.This unit has the greatest ability to charge multiple devices at the same time.A great warranty of 18 months, fast and easy support and a super great price, all combined with wonderful Amazon service - can't ask for any better~!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CEZBKTO" id="B00CEZBKTO-review77" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-26:</strong> he devices charged as if they were plugged into the normal chargers.

I originally wanted the Anker 2nd Gen Astro2 9000mAh model cause I was worried about the size of this thing as it lives in my daily Timbuk2 bag but when I finally went to buy it it was out of stock :-(What to do, what to do?I think what sold me on this was the fact that it has 3 charging ports on it :-)  for me that is my Note3, Kindle Paperwhite (version2)and a Nexus7 tablet all at the same time if need be. I can also charge my Note3 and another device if in a social setting.  Regardless, I don't think I'm ever going to need all of this but I have it!The reason this gets 5 stars is because unlike my original battery pack needing a special charge cable, this unit does not, you can charge it with any old micro USB cable or car charger.  Very handy especially when traveling.  I love it!!!When you get the device and take it out of the box it helps to charge the unit till thr round white disk on the unit glows a solid white, it is basically the battery level indicator.  Once charged you can always see what the status of the battery is by either shaking the unit slightly which turns that gauge on or by touching it.As far as the ports are concerned here is the breakdown of what they are:Two of the ports are universal ports that are capable of charging most devices up to 1.5 Amps.The Third port is Smart meaning it charges up to 2.4 Amps, using smart chip technology to detect the USB pin signals and identify the device, then auto-adjusting the output to suit.Unlike my previous battery there are no buttons on this unit, plug your device into this battery and it begins to charge it.  There is no questioning is it on?  Its on...And because it uses a standard micro USB cable to recharge the battery itself as an other reviewer on YouTube stated you can plug the battery into a car charger to charge it while plugging your phone or tablet into the battery to charge them, then while charging if you need to shut the engine off say your going into a store, you can still charge your phone or tablet. (for cars where the cigarette lighter shuts off when the key is pulled).Some users have complained about the size of the unit and the weight but to be honest, it is no bigger or heavier that my last battery unit, the size and weight really don't bother me at all.  I don't even notice it.Cons:The pouch it comes with is Super tight and it difficult to put the battery into it.  I don't even use it.  The finish on the battery prevents scratching so I hardly see a need for it.Versatile, simple to use, easy.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CEZBKTO" id="B00CEZBKTO-review82" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-15:</strong> I was worried this thing was going to be a behemoth compared to my Anker Astro 2.

The Pack itself will hold its charge extremely well for weeks or longer. The whole pack is good for an entire charge of the 10k battery under use. The smart port and the onboard power chip are a great combo, It is still more efficient than any Mophie pack I have owned (Many), and it prevents overcharge, and conditions the battery with normal use. It charges quickly (overnight) when paired with a good 2.1A charger.I compared this directly with the Mophie Juicepack Pro Duo 6000mah which was double the cost retail, I no longer have it, because I kept the Anker pack; @ a lower pricepoint without a sale, double the capacity and an extra port made this decision a no brainer.With the stock battery on my note 3, I was able to get a good 3 days use when paired with this pack, good for 2.5+ charges on the 3200mah battery.

It comes with a mesh pouch, nice touch there for us traveling folks. I am not so thrilled about the shaking function to activate the charger; I would rather just have a plain on-off switch. It holds charge very well and is capable of charging multiple products all at once. It cannot be charged while charging other devices, which I thought it's odd and not very convenient. The lack of this feature knocks a star out of the gate. I note that if I charge my Bose BT headset by alone, the charger would turn off after a while, even though the Bose has not been fully charged... I think that there must be is a minimum load on the charger to keep it up and running. The Bose really draws very little current, and unless I keep shaking the charger from time to time, I will not get my Bose to be fully charged. This goes away if I connect additional devices to the charger... then everything gets charged fully... the unit will eventually turns itself off, but at that point, I am not sure if the charger goes into trickle charge or it just turns off....What I like: multi-ports to charge multi devices; well built; carrying pouchWhat I don't like: shaking function to activate; different current rating for different ports (Anker should just use the IQ technology and distribute the power to the ports on demand and as needed, like all other products they make)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CEZBKTO" id="B00CEZBKTO-review92" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-18:</strong> If you're active and out and about doing things, this is not the battery pack for you.

Was thinking of going with the smaller 6,000 or 9,000 mah model but so glad I bought this one. Great for power hungry netflix watching youtube viewing music streaming people who just can't put down their phones. This will charge my smartphone (htc one) at least twice, I know its says you can get 5 or 10 or whatever number they tell you. Its doesn't charge as many times as you would think. But the tradeoff for that is that you can charge most devices at full speed, just as if they were plugged into the wall. For me this is worth it. I've purchased many portable battery &#34;packs&#34; only to plug my phone in to charge, and I realize it doesn't actually charge anything. Sometimes they just extend your phone battery with the complete charging process taking almost a full 8 hours. Anker really made a quality product here, fitting such a large capacity battery in such a compact form. I also like to see how much power it has left in 10 percent increments. Some cheaper batteries will give you 3 or 4 lights and be like &#34;yeah each light means 25% or 33% power&#34;.  What the crap is that. I hate having to guess just tell me.

No, this one is like nothing I have ever tested from Anker or anybody else. It's not a surprise Anker became one of my favorite companies to review new products from because they are constantly introducing something new and/or improved. That is the only way to stay on top of the game and to earn the top rating of your customers.First of all, even with it's 12000 mAh capacity, this new 2nd gen Astro shrank up in size down to 110 mm x 83 mm x 26 mm which fits very comfortably and feels very nice with its soft touch rubbery finish in your hand. At close to 10 oz in weight you will feel it for sure in your pocket, although it's slick design is very portable and with included mesh pouch is easy to carry around in your bag/purse/backpack or even pants pocket, as long as you are not wearing skinny jeans :) In contrast to most of the today's external batteries with dual output, Astro 3 comes with 3 independent full size usb outputs that deliver a whooping 4A of combined current. I checked it by charging Note 2, S4, and Nexus 7 simultaneously and was able to confirm that right on a dot. N2 was charging at about 2A, S4 at about 1A, and N7 at about 1A as well. I was actually timing and monitoring the percentage of battery change, not just relying on Current Charge app. These 3 usb charging outputs are actually partitioned into one Smart output (intended for Apple devices and other android devices) and two Universal outputs which are specifically designed to charge Android devices at maximum speed. There is some custom circuit which determines max speed and optimizes output correspondingly. I also noticed the safety nature of this circuit prevented me from charging both N2 and S4 at 2A each from Universal outputs where N2 was charging at 2A and S4 at 1A, leaving 1A for Smart output, thus confirming it's not a bulk current sharing between all 3 ports. The input port, micro-usb, for charging Astor 3 is actually a fast 1.5A input which is great since it charges this external battery at 1.5x times faster rate.While you charging the battery itself or using to charge other devices, another huge improvement in the design is a circular 10-segment indicator with granularity of 10%. You no longer have to rely on a typical 4-segment led. This one will give you a more precise reading, although it might take you a little while to get used to figuring out on a spot the exact percentage by counting segments before light times out. Once the light turns off, it's a clean surface design with no leds or buttons. So how do you turn it on or verify led count? Yet another cool innovation, just do a shake of the battery and indicator circle turns on to reveal number of active segments. I really like that motion activated switch, makes it very unique. But trust me, it's not the most unique part of this new Astro 3 design. As I mentioned in a number of my previous reviews, the labeled capacity of the battery is not what you actually get. It's the capacity of the cells inside of external battery when it has to be converted to 5V usb interface at the output and then back from 5V to 3.7V inside of the phone. During this conversion ALL external batteries loose anywhere between 30%-35% of its capacity. Well, this new 2nd gen Astro 3 is optimized to a much higher efficiency. I have tested it and can confirm it provides the actual charging capacity of 10,044 mAh, which means a loss of only 16%!!! Basically, the internal battery circuit has been optimized to provide a more efficient output. I have tested a lot of external batteries, and this is the first one I have seen at such high efficiency.Overall, I was very impressed with a design and features of this battery, especially with how efficient it's output. For $49.99 on Amazon its a great value where it provides the actual capacity output equal to other more expensive batteries labeled at around 14000 mAh. With a high output efficiency, 4A of total combined charging current, triple output, and motion activated 10-segment led indicator - I highly recommend it!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CEZBKTO" id="B00CEZBKTO-review98" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-06:</strong> Got this as a gift for a friend and he's really liking it.

The new ANKER Astro 3 is the perfect solution for this widely accepted issue with not only Apple products but with nearly any electronic device. After having and using this device for the past week, I can easily confirm that it provides up to 7 FULL 1-100% charges for my iPhone 5. Some external batteries market these kinds of numbers, but this 12,000mAh monster owns up to its promise.The Anker 2nd Gen Astro3 is perfect solution - it is affordable, durable, and most definitely useful. The device comes pre-charged out of the box and only takes about 6-8 hours from my experience to gain a substantial amount of charge again. One unique feature with this device is that it comes with 3 USB outs. Most external batteries only have 2, but this device has been able to accommodate 3 which allows you and your friends to all charge at once. Not only will you like sharing but your friends will be impressed with your "nifty-ness"!Over the past two days, I along with 3 other friends were at the beach. The Anker Astro3 provided all 4 of us with charged iPhones (2 iPhone 5s and 2 iPhone 4S's) for the course of 2 entire days! Amazing! We were all satisfied with how well this device charged in a matter of minutes. Putting the devices into Airplane mode made the Astro a rocket in boosting the batteries for our phones. The Astro3 was definitely something we would not have been able to live without as all our phones would've been dead the first day on the beach.Not only can the Anker Astro3 charge iPhones but it can also charge full-fleshed iPads and other battery-driven tablets. Being an iPad 4 owner, I can comment on how well this little power pack can charge the entire tablet in a matter of hours WHILE charging my other devices such as my iPhone and camera. This "all at once" feature is so useful and definitely something that is used a lot.This device encompasses some unique features within it as well. Firstly, it has a circular dial that powers up with LED lights to indicate how much percentage is remaining to the 10th of the percentage - this is much better than having to the 25th of a percentage like other devices. Additionally, the device powers on when the user shakes it so it is not losing any power when it is not being used. Lastly, the entire Astro3 is is built from a sturdy, sleek material which can easily fit into your pocket. It feels good to hold and is smooth to the touch - the matte design is simply mind-blowing.Overall, I have no complaints for this device - it is powerful in every single way. From its sleek design principles to the actual usefulness of the external battery, I am more than impressed by how well it can handle multiple devices charging at once. Anker has really outdone themselves again this time. Their customer service and product management teams both should be proud of this device that they now offer. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for an external battery pack for their electronic USB powered devices.I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest. No intention of a positive review was expected by Anker.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CEZBKTO" id="B00CEZBKTO-review100" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-31:</strong> I can't comment on durability yet, but overall it's well engineered and working great.

To access the macro lens you need to unscrew the wide angle lens. It comes with lens caps and a drawstring carrying case.Limitations include:1. You can't have a protective screen on your phone as the fit is THAT snug2. No flash when using this attachment3. You need to take it off when calls come in4. You need a very steady hand to get crisp macro images, and you need to be thiscloseupto your subject5. The lens caps have a mind of their own and disappear into thin air.Otherwise, it's portable and quick to attach, and comes in very handy when taking architectural photos or landscapes to send to friends or post online.  It's also pretty good with the obligatory photos of what you're having for lunch or dinner.

One thing that I can't use, the led light flash. If there is a window or a little hole that fits the size of the led light, it would be good.

No degradation in performance over time as you get with the foam tipped units. Good for writing, drawing and pressing buttons. Pen works well.*Note: If you want to save money, the Targus and Griffin stylus are identical to this one. This one just has a pen built in and is MUCH nicer in terms of quality and build of product. Functionality is the same though.Just bought the Boxwave in my quest for the best stylus. This one has the rubber soft tip which I like better than the foam. I think the rubber tipped styli show more of an effort in development rather than the left over circuit foam styli that might as well tell you that you're not worth the R&D; (pogo).Out of the box this thing feels like a small to medium sized pen. It actually is an ink pen on one end and a stylus on the other. With regard to dual function styli, I like this one because the pen is capped and when you are not using it, the cap adds to the body of the stylus as if there is no separate piece.Looks great too.I have to compare it to the Targus or Griffin one because that's the closest in similarity. It does seem to be slightly more sensitive than the Targus, not deal breaker sensitive but depending on what application you are using, it could mean the difference between smooth writing and less than smooth writing. (your hand weight, writing pressure and writing style make a difference too). It's about a half an inch longer than the Targus, which gives it some nice pen like feel in  your hand.This feels more like a pen than the Targus does, and while that has to do with the fact that it actually is an ink pen as well, it's also to do with construction of the item.On tests using Penultimate, Upad, Paperdesk, Note Taker HD, and Neu.notes I found the boxwave to perform very well and objectively better than the targus. However, I think at this point that all "rubber" tipped styli will perform similarly and it might come down to which device feels the best in your hand. As with ink pens, how the item feels is just as important and can play a role in quality of writing as how it actually writes. In this case, both the ink pen and the stylus function work well and do their job properly. I am overall pleased with this but I am reserving jumping jacks for a few weeks of use to see how it performs after some wear.In comparison to the pogo, there is no comparison. This to the pogo is like a ferrari to a yugo. The pogo being the yugo. I would not mind if the boxwave came in a slimmer barrel and had aluminum anodized colors, but I will likely never go back to a foam tip.Saying that though, I have to say as before, your writing style will dictate which type of stylus is right for you. If given the chance, get one of each and see what works better or try them out in the store. Had I done that with the foamies, I would have stayed away, but I can see that they would work for some people.I think the price I paid for this stylus is good, but I would not pay more since I really do believe now that the rubber tip is going to be pretty much the same. Unless you pay more for aesthetics do not pay more because you believe the tips will be different, they won't be. Griffin, Targus and Boxwave rubber tipped styli are identical even down to the silver metal band that holds the tip to the barrel. Identical.I would, and probably will buy another Boxwave stylus.Pros:Good weightVery nice construction and materialsQuality feel over other brands, doesn't feel like a generic stick, actually feels like thought went into it.Ink is refillable with standard store bought refills. Included ink works well but is clearly genericMetal barrel with metal ink head. Dual O-rings on ink end prevent debris from entering barrel and keep cap tightCons:None really. Only wish the cap could be fit over the stylus when using the ink pen, but that would create a design issueWill update if I find any issue during use.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B000KK1MAC', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B000KK1MAC', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B000P7LHDW</h2>    <p class="price"> $B000P7LHDW</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

The battery pack itself is the perfect size, very slim and just the right length and width to fit perfectly in the front pocket of my jeans to not be bulky and unbearable. If my phone is completely dead it will bring it up to about 80% but this is only a matter of which battery is bigger. This little battery pack holds a very good amount (1860mAh rated) for its size.The additional USB output port is a nice feature too to charge another phone, bluetooth earpiece or iPod even. The attached USB cable works perfect on my phone and isn't loose by any means so once it is in and connected, it stays that way.The indicator lights and power on/off button seem to get the job done, no complaints there really, and the charger that comes with this battery back is a generic Motorola charger that works well and charges the pack up in a decent amount of time.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008RZYN8A" id="B008RZYN8A-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-31:</strong> My boyfriend lent me his charger and it was so wonderful because I work and go to school fulltime so I dont always have time to charge my phone or a place to charge it so this was a great solution.

However, in my case, it only took thinking ahead a bit. On a recent trip to NY after making calls, pulling up maps, checking Yelp reviews, etc my phone went dead in record time (and of course in the middle of a call). Having charged my Motorola battery pack the previous night, I was quickly able to connect again to the world. The built in cord connected phone and battery pack in just seconds. The phone was a little more cumbersome to use with the pack attached, but it was certainly preferable to no phone at all. Interestingly, the pack proved to increase the amount of time available by a multiple of 3 compared to my phone's stock battery. Back at the hotel I left the 2 devices connected and plugged in only the battery pack to the wall outlet. I was able to charge both devices at once even while periodically using the phone. Besides the phone, I've since used the pack to power / charge my Kindle Fire when it went dead while out and about. For me, the key has been getting in the habit of charging up the pack daily as I do my phone. With a not supplied mini USB to regular USB connection cord, I can also charge the pack from my laptop. Since this was cheaper than a 2nd phone battery, lasts longer than my regular phone battery  and can be used for more than just phone battery backup, buying the pack made more sense.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008RZYN8A" id="B008RZYN8A-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-09:</strong> It charges my phone like it is supposed to, I don't know what else I should say about this product.

The problems with it are as follows.  The entire side of the unit is your answer and hang up button.  If it starts to slip out of your ear and you push it back in,  you hang up on your call.  I got my wife one also and she hung up on someone three times, it is difficult to avoid.  The volume control is unique others had an issue with it hanging up their calls and I can see that happing since you have to gently glide your finger up and down the side to control the volume,  a little too much pressure and goodbye.  To charge the unit or turn it off you must return it to the stone holder, the USB charge is on that device only, if you forget the base at home you cannot charge it while on the road or turn it off.  The other problem I have with it taking it out of the stone base is supposed to turn it on and activate it, I had to place it back in the base and remove it three times to get it to turn on.  This has not been an uncommon problem for me, I called tech support and they told me to exchange it.  I would like to see Jabra take  the over all design and lose the stone piece place a usb connector and a real on off switch with a more pronounced answer key.  Not sure how they would design it but the comfort of this headset is better than any I have tried.  I also purchased the Jabra Extreme to try and that is a very good headset, I can write more about it later but the extreme like other headsets begins to hurt your ear after you have been wearing it for an extended time.  Bottom line I don't recommend the Jabra Stone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003WQCB38" id="B003WQCB38-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-02-06:</strong> I purchased the Jabra Stone with the hope that I could enjoy a modern piece of equipment but after buying it, I regret having done so. This item is far from user friendly and pretty much uncomfortable to wear. for one thing it keeps slipping from the ear which makes it hard to listen during conversation especially if you wear Glasses. Not a crisp clear sound like they claim.  what is worse is that every time I went to push it back to continue my conversation, I would accidentally disconnect the caller. This is embarrassing when making a deal over the phone with my customers.  Battery life is also very bad, I think it was 30 mins before I heard the warning beep between charges.  The only feature I enjoy is that the unit is concealed and looks very high tech. Also the base to carry it on charges the unit which is convenient. The most important aspects of this unit, Not So Good.  It has not been a month since I purchased my Unit and regrettably I had an unfortunate incindent because as I mentioned it does not sit securely in the ear. I was watching my hands and when I went to remove my glasses to wipe the lens, inadvertently the Stone made a free fall into the sink....Yikes!  Bottomline, I would not recommend this to anyone. I wish I can get my money back....What a waste.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003WQCB38" id="B003WQCB38-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-07-23:</strong> Initially, I was thrilled with my Jabra Stone (bought one for my wife as well) but the thrill diminished with time as I continually had trouble keeping it from sliding out of my ear when in use.

It works fine for Netflix, Evernote, the kind of stuff I use.  If you want to play Halo or graphics heavy games, you might want to get the horsepower in the Samsung Note 3 instead.  But you're saving $400 here-- you can buy a PS4 or Xbox One with what you're saving, if you really want to Halo...- I was worried as this is a &#34;Chinese Knock off&#34; delivered from China, but it feels just like a Samsung Note / Galaxy.- Shipping was free / includedCONS- The pen that comes with it-- just buy another pen if you want to use a pen.  Even better, just use your finger.- Ships from China... it took 2 weeks to arrive.- As the manufacturer is from China and the warranty is 30 days... you're kind of screwed if you break this thing.

This is a true U9000 with the correct rams,rom,and pixels. I'm only getting 2g service via T-Mobile. I might try At&t; next month, The day i got the phone i was leaving out of town 4 hrs later via amtrak train so yano service would be buggy. Before i left home i upload all my apps from play store via WiFi and everything ran fast and smooth. I also sent a few test picture text and that work fast and fine. so far the phone is working great, 1 or 2 minor problems with the Air Command pen, Sometimes when you pull it out it do not always activate the air command window but after re inserting and releasing it will appear, Its also alil hard to pull it out as if its a tight space. The eye sight gestures works sorta of flimsy meaning if your eyes turn away it don't always stop a video right away as if its a delay sometimes. And also same with the hand turning the page/screen gestures it works a little buggy as well. But these few minor things is not a big problem considering this phone is less than 250.00, I got complements about the sharpness of my picture the back side camera take great pics really clear, sharp and nice, and my family had a Galaxy S4 and my pics was better than his pics The front camera takes good pics also depending on the lighting its not as sharp as the back, But trust me both cams take good pics and videos. Sound quality is great and loud.Im doing this review about a week after getting this phone. I will spend the next few days checking it out more. So far its really a 5 Star phone. I will edit my review later this weekend.*******************Updating 3/25/14******************************My only issue with this phone is battery life. I'm so sad about the charging time and life time. This would be a good phone for the price if it last long enough or charge faster.

I will but it.***********************Updating 4/11/14**********************************************************Phone Still working great, Today i went in a radio shack and tried out a Note 3 outta box and it fit perfectly.. and if that fit that means mostly all note 3 cases fit, Everything lines up the same as the S-Note 3 and this phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00G4TRU54', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00G4TRU54', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B0092T8UAC</h2>    <p class="price"> $B0092T8UAC</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

If you were to mess up a quick use of tape will clear up any dust particles.Most bubbles do go away after a day but not all will and that is due to dust being caught, again use tape to remove from screen protector (not on your device).I highly recommend this company and their protectors but will caution that their matte protectors tend to diminish screen quality compared to a screenless device or a clear screen protector.

You'll then have to make adjustments and wiggle around the skin so all the holes and phone buttons line up exactly. It takes a few minutes to get it all right. After that, the volume buttons and on/off toggle are easy to push and everything is as it should be.The skin wraps around part of the front of the phone as well, giving it some additional protection if placed facedown. I like the Thunderbolt flap. It protects the port from dust and other hazards.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009YME330" id="B009YME330-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-03:</strong> Great Fit.

I really liked the way the look seemed to compliment the iPhone with the black border and clear back on my white (Stupid company) iPhone so I went ahead and ordered it.I'll be honest, my expectations were low and I thought I'd get some cheap case that would hold up for a few weeks before starting to discolor or deform.NOPE!I'm extremely impressed with the overall build quality and feel of this case, it punches way above it's price point.The materials feel very high grade and have not shown any signs of discoloration since I've started using it.  Impact protection, which is something they mention on this design, seems good as neither the case nor my phone have taken damage from couple of 'Out of Pocket Experiences' that occurred with the case.All ports and buttons are easily accessible, button coverings for power and volume buttons are firm but perfectly functional while all ports on the bottom fit even my equipment mounts.Overall, this is a great low cost case that you won't feel that you skimped on while using it.I would consider this as a case for a personal phone, that is how impressed I am with the build quality and overall feel of the case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EP507EA" id="B00EP507EA-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-19:</strong> At first when I was putting the case I was thinking of the really bad reviews how it was scratching up the phone, there were already marks on it and stuff... thats exactly what happened ...

It has protected my phone for more than a few drops, including one from about 4ft to concrete. It's raised enough on the front to protect the screen if it lays or lands face down, and feels very comfortable in hand. The bad part is, dust/ dirt/ whatever gets under the back clear plastic and the phone rubbing against the plastic scratches up the back of the phone quite a bit. Maybe it'll help to put a picture in the back, but the point of the 5C is the color.

It's not as armored as Spigen's tough armor products, but it strikes a nice compromise between showing off the 5C and providing decent drop protection.

It fits my iPhone 5c snugly, and I have easy access to the important features on the bottom of the phone, and the power & volume buttons work smoothly and without having to apply a ridiculous amount of pressure. I also have easy access to the silence button just above the volume controlsThe phone w/case fits in my back and front jeans pockets, which is important to me.I've dropped it twice, once on carpet and once on hardwood floor. It survived, but I don't know if the case had anything to do with it or not. The falls weren't from much height, and the landings were pretty soft.The rubber bumper provides a 2 or 3mm step that should protect the screen if the phone lands face down. Unfortunately, this is one of those things that you don't know until it happens. I have a ZAGG screen protector on it, which helps protect the screen from scratches, etc., but probably not falls.The screen protector that came with the phone didn't seem adequate to me, but others might find it to be perfectly suitable.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EP507EA" id="B00EP507EA-review39" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-14:</strong> I bought this to replace a Luvvitt mistake I made earlier.  This case is perfect!  It does not add much bulk to the phone and feels like it will offer very good drop protection.  The buttons function easily & accurately.  Many complaints I read before I purchased reference the clear back not being clear enough.  Once I pulled the masking off both the inside & outside, the back was crystal clear.  The masking had no visible edge to pull.  I had to pick & scrape at the corner to get it off.  I would guess that complaints regarding the back were due to the masking not being removed.  Time will tell how well the back stays scratch free.  Honestly, it is not that important to me.

I had a bumper case on my original 5c which boasted the same kind of lip feature that keeps the glass face from touching the surface that it's laid on, but one drop and my screen shattered. i went looking for a more protective case but products like otterbox completely cancel out the ability to carry a slim phone by adding a ton of bulk. this case is the perfect mix of protection but still keeps it relatively slim. the material is also worth mentioning. i like the shock absorbing cushion and &#34;grippiness&#34; of a silicone type case but hate that it doesn't slide into my pocket easily and is hard to wash off. this material is the perfect mix of soft silicone but also polished smooth surface so it never gets caught on my hair or stuck in my pocket and wipes down easily. and ESPECIALLY for the price! totally worth every penny! and YAY for the clear case to show off the fun colors! well done spigen!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00EP507EA', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00EP507EA', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B0083XTSAO</h2>    <p class="price"> $B0083XTSAO</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

It is well made, holds the phone securely, and is comfortable. It can be difficult to insert or remove the phone as the vinyl window likes to stick to the screen. My naked S3 fits perfectly once I get it in there, but I cannot get it in there when it is wearing its TPU case. It seems like there would be enough room, but the smooth, glossy frame of the case sticks to the window and will only slide about three-quarters of the way in. The biggest design problem with the armband is that it covers the power and volume buttons. Power isn't a big deal as you can use the home button, but the volume buttons are difficult to locate and use. There is also no built-in cord management (I tuck the excess between my arm and the band).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0083XTSAO" id="B0083XTSAO-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-12:</strong> This product not only got stuck and peeled my expensive Zagat screen off, it also pulled my power button out.This is a terrible product that destroys the phone.

I had to use the pictures off the site to figure out how it should sit on the air vent, but once it is put together, you just have to figure out the best position for your specific vehicle. This does move around a bit along the air vent as the clamps simply slide onto the vent bar, but that works ok for me. It clamps my S4 well in any of the cases I use, and removing the phone is super easy with a release button positioned on the side. All in all, it works ok for the money. I would recommend if you just need a simple mount to use in portrait every now and then. I rarely use the swivel feature, but it is a snap in-and-out feature positioned directly on the back that lies on the air vent.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CH8PCWO" id="B00CH8PCWO-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-27:</strong> It's okay.

However, I'm pleased with it. Considering the low price, even if it doesn't last long, it's a decent deal. Interestingly, the charger I received looks slightly different than what's pictured. The main difference is that the LED light on mine is long and narrow, rather than a single LED point as shown in the photo. Also, the LED on mine is neon blue when no battery is inserted and a bright pink when charging. Kind of cool looking for a cheap device.Anyway, it's light, compact, cheap, and works. It is not fast, however. I noted that it seems to take a completely discharged battery about 5-6 hours to fully charge in this device.Overall, if it lasts even 6 months, I'll be fairly pleased (considering the low price). I may get another one as a backup.I would note, however, that an OEM Blackberry external charger can be bought on Amazon for roughly two to three times the price of this one (but would likely be faster and more durable).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001MEV8LI" id="B001MEV8LI-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-09-12:</strong> the battery charger may be good, and it's nice that it can charge the phone directly or just a battery externally.  buy a spare battery and charge it with this.  the light indicates when it is charged.I just realized that my reviews are the closest thing to my immortality.  this stuff is already outdated but my words will live on in amazon forever.  nobody will be using this device in 10 years hopefully.  maybe they will have fuel cells, or body powered devices, or brain implant so you can just stop using blackberry/iphone or maybe I'll have a personal assistant who carries my blackberry, phone, watch or whatever so I don't need to bother.

It's been a solid performer for charging my smartphone and bluetooth headset. It sits solidly in my car charger port and doesn't pull out easily if knocked into. I really like that because there is nothing worse than having a lose connection with a car charger and even though you think it is charging, it is not in far enough. But this is lacking an LED light to let you know that it is sending power. That is a curse and a blessing to me. In this case, it is not too bad because the charger sits so snugly. But with other car chargers I've had, it's nice to know if you've knocked it lose. BUT the LED light can be a distraction if it is too bright. So I really don't miss it on this one.I've charged two devices at once using my USB cables and had no trouble at all. But I haven't plugged anything really tough into it.

Still looking.- Battery not changeable (not a big deal, since we have a portable battery pack charger to keep it going for days)- No micro sd card slot (not a big deal with the 32gb internal space)Other:- Button layout was a slight learning curve.  It's not a con, but it's not a pro either, just be aware that the layout of the hardware buttons is something to get used to.  I will say though, once you accommodate yourself to it, it's pretty easy to work with since the phone is large.  There also hasn't been any accidental volume changes or powering on the device, which is a plus.  I accidentally hit the power and volume keys on my Galaxy SIII all the time.Since this is my wife's phone, I haven't used it as a daily driver, but the battery lasts all day (usually around 20% left by 6 pm), when her old Galaxy SIII would die by 2 pm.  She uses it heavily for Facebook messaging and talks about 2 hours a day on it for her business.I would recommend this device to anyone who wants a fast device with a large screen.  Movies from netflix look amazing on it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00G9FV91O" id="B00G9FV91O-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-28:</strong> I love this phone:-The battery never seems to run out (except once with constant gps, phone calls and pandora...)-Knock on feature!-No side buttons to bumpI have other reasons as well but those are my favorite features!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00G9FV91O" id="B00G9FV91O-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-26:</strong> I love the phone, but the reason I'm giving 3 star is because this is my second phone, the first I had to return. Because the reception was good or should say too good. It was so fast that it would not even let me type anything. It would go right in to another screen by just touching just a bit the screen. 4 G Lite was good, well too good. The description says that the audio is suppose to be very good. Well the phone does have what it look like two speakers, but the sound come out of only one, and very low. Since I got them I tried to update the software and was looking for anything that would help with the sound but nothing has change, I fixed it by buying a Bluetooth, that allow me to listen to music and talk in the phone.Also this one takes too long to access internet, while the first one was very good with internet this one is too slow. I wish I could change it again, but I'm afraid it will be the same. Will think about it.The HD screen is GREAT, love it. My wife has the S3, not even close to my phone HD screen. She want one like my phone but we are afraid it would be like mine. I'm hoping they can fix this issues.If anything changes, I will update this review. Because I really like the phone, just hate to wait for it to connect to internet when I,m paying good money for data.JC</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00G9FV91O" id="B00G9FV91O-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-26:</strong> Pro's:Excellent Battery LifeBeautiful ScreenVirtually Bezel-less DisplayVery CustomizableFastCon's:Stock Browser Doesn't Have Text ReflowSingle Speaker is weak (coming from an HTC One w/Dual Front Facing Speakers)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00G9FV91O" id="B00G9FV91O-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-29:</strong> My wife absolutely loves this phone from Sprint. Replaced a Samsung Galaxy S2 with it. Only issue was that the phone was not activated directly in the mail as it claimed. We had to take the phone to a Sprint store to complete activation.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00G9FV91O" id="B00G9FV91O-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-27:</strong> For some reason the double tap feature always makes me think of Harry Potter tapping twice on the Marauders Map and saying Mischief Managed. Corniness aside I absolutely love this phone. I really wanted the Samsung Galaxy S4 but it was sold out so I &#34;settled&#34; for this phone. Sometimes settling is a good thing.Like a lot of reviewers I thought the back power and volume buttons would be annoying but I love their placement. They're unobtrusive and never get in the way. I love the double tap feature and find myself tapping everything now and getting annoyed when it doesn't work. This double tap feature is so important to me now that I'm not sure I want a phone that doesn't have it.I didn't know that the phone did not have a removable battery or an SD card slot when I took it home but that has actually not bothered me at all. The 32 GB is plenty because all my music is in the cloud anyway and Dropbox automatically backups all my photos. It may be that in a few years when the battery has a problem I'll care more about it. Battery life right now is amazing and the phone charges really quickly. Yes GPS does suck power but I just keep it on the charger when using GPS. The phone is really responsive however it has frozen and rebooted a few times when I did something too fast.The other day out of the blue the screen brightness on the Kindle app kept changing from dim to bright so I powered the phone down and restarted it. When the phone restarted it looked just like it did when I first took it out of the box. It had the default Sprint apps displayed and all my carefully arranged apps had disappeared from the screens. I still had all my apps installed but they were no longer displayed. That was a very frustrating experience as it took a while to get everything back the way it had been. I did take the opportunity to acquaint myself with the Home Screen option in Settings where you can backup app/widget layouts and themes (Home backup & restore). If I had used this setting after first setting up my phone 3 months ago I would have saved myself a lot of aggravation.The size of the phone is perfect. I have very long fingers and smaller phones always fell out of my hands multiple times a day. This phone feels perfect in my hands and I can hold it and Swype with one hand. The biggest plus is that I have not dropped the phone once in the three months I've had it.I switched from Virgin Mobile and it was a very quick process for Tech Support to switch my number over to Sprint. The cell tower upgrade issues have been a huge pain but I finally get LTE continuously wherever I go now.The camera takes great pictures and is very easy and quick to use. The flash work well and I've taken some great pictures in the dark. The screen is beautiful. I like having a background picture on my text messages. The remote app is super useful as our main TV remote has buttons that don't respond any longer. I especially like the idea of changing the channel when my husband is hogging the remote during March Madness.TIP: For folks who hate losing their text messages when switching phones, the SMS Backup & Restore app is awesome for moving those text messages from your old phone to the new phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00G9FV91O', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00G9FV91O', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00GRS1NO6</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00GRS1NO6</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

My only issue is that the "open" corner has a small crack in it from one of the times I've dropped it.

Unlike other cases, this design doesn't cover up the buttons.  In fact, the top and bottom has minimal protection since there is no plastic there.  While the lack of plastic in these areas make access to buttons, ports, and mic easier, it leaves those areas exposed to damage.The plastic itself is very soft and comfortable to hold unlike the harder feeling PVC type cases.  However, this case doesn't have the ribbed sides that my other cases have to assist with the grip.  It's been several weeks and the case has stayed clean and white.While I'm using this on a black phone, a white phone would be a match made in heaven.  The black phone with this white cover doesn't look too bad either.Recommended if you carry a purse to protect the phone. Otherwise, you're risking the phone to potential damage that you would otherwise be protected using a "wrap-around" case.This case is made in Korea.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006IRPV9E" id="B006IRPV9E-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-15:</strong> It's a hard plastic, not as rubbery as the original one that came with the phone, but it's white and so much easier to find in my purse! the other one was gray...I also tried the other one with the stand, but it was too wide to hold with one hand.

Simple case, rubberized texture, fit the phone.  The back cover has very thin notches to keep it in place, that way it doesn't disrupt the phone sliding open for using the QWERTY keypad.After 6 days, and very little of the phone, the very thin notches on the back cover snapped, so the back portion no longer stays on the phone.  I understand it's hard to design a case to fit a slider phone with moving parts, but it's a shame it snapped so quickly.

The one that came with my phone works perfectly, but I wanted another charger for my desk at work. I ordered one from AT&T;, but they don't send the same charger that comes WITH the phone (moon logic), and the one they DO sell causes my touch screen to complete freak out when I try to use the phone while plugged in. So does this model here -Samsung Captivate Wall Charger- the charger seems to work fine when plugged into a computer, but plug it into a wall and you can't use your phone *at all* while it's charging because the touch screen will register your fingers everywhere.I finally tried this charger -Samsung Travel Charger- and it works great, so I'm very pleased and relieved. The only drawback is that this is ONLY a wall charger - there's no detachable USB cord to hook into a computer. That's fine for work, because I wouldn't be hooking my phone up there anyway, but I do wish I could find a good wall charger that had full functionality. Still, I'm pleased with this charger and will probably order another one.~ Ana Mardoll</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002M4NMWU" id="B002M4NMWU-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-06:</strong> Would highly recommend it.

I'd been tempted by the New Trents and a couple of others. Then recently, saw these Ankers and made the plunge after seeing the specs, reading the reviews, and seeing how involved the company was in providing suppport. I not only bought this item, but I also bought 2 x Astro 10,000mAh models. I've only had these 3 days, and have spent the majority of time testing the 5,600mAh model. I will compare more in future updates.First, I understood at purchase that the manufacturer stated a 30% loss due to various conversions. This means I can expect 3,920mAh of juice in real world use.I own a Galaxy Nexus phone. The phone is a battery hog. It comes with a stock 1,850mAh phone battery. With the Astro 5600, I should be able to charge my phone 2.12 times. Here are my initial test results.After depleting my phone battery to 0% and it shut off on its own:90% Charge after 1:20 (1 hour 20 minutes)100% Charge after 1:48Out of 4 bars, I had 2 left. But when I unplugged charger from phone, it jumped to 3 bars. Phone was left off until 90% charge. Then I kept screen off.After a second discharge to 1% and not letting phone shut off, but with screen off:100% Charge after 1:461 bar out of 4 remaining.After 3rd discharge to 10%, with screen off:38% Charge (Total of 20% actual charge) before Anker shut off.LED light still worked at least several hours after Anker stopped charging. I didn't see it stop since I went to bed.After a full discharge of the Anker 5600, it took about 6:50 to fully charge the battery back up using provided charger.The Anker 5600 performed exactly as I expected, capacity wise. It fully charges my Galaxy Nexus in under 2 hours.Compared to its bigger sibling, this device is near 1/3rd the size of the bigger model and yet has more than twice the capacity. It is the choice for charging mobility. I would not carry the big Astro 10,000 in my pocket! I could carry this one, but it is fat and does stick out in my slacks. I wish this were slimmer and wider.The Anker Astro 5600 is an all around winner. I'm more excited about this purchase than even the 10,000mAh version. The two of those I also purchased will be going to my kids and wife as they will not need it for discreet portability. They have a different purpose and I'll review them later.PROS:-Performs as stated-Charges phone fast for an external battery-Small in size-Holds a big charge for its size-Plastic, but seems durable-LED indicators seem accurate-Manufacturer warranty and support seems great (haven't used yet)CONS:-Fat, would be nice if half as thin-Takes almost 7 hours to fully recharge-Can only charge 1 device at a time-Finger print magnetNEUTRAL:-LED light can be handy, but not the best flashlight-Haven't had long enough to know if light turning on is an issue-Long term durability and life of battery unknown as of this review-Looks nice (subjective)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-25:</strong> Great device!!!

Based on my first one which I have the product is great. I keep it charged and when going on trips or even out for a long day I take it so that I can boost my phone battery when it gets low. It is strong enough to recharge both mine and my wife batteries and still have a little bit left.  The only problem with the second one is the little baggy that usually has all the cords was empty. We got only the cord to charge up the battery but nothing to charge the phones. Because my family member was leaving we did not have time to return and get another as she needed it for her trip home on long flights. I gave her a spare charge cord for her phone and it worked out for her but I am still a bit irritated we did not get the cords we were supposed to and yes while we could have gotten it replaced it would have meant not having it for the main purpose which was her return flight home.  All in all a good product and if the need came up I would buy again but not if I was on a time crunch just in case I had to return for missing parts.UPDATE - Seems when I ordered my second Astro 5600 I used the old link and description and did not realize the additional cords were no longer included due to the large variety of possible devices this can be used for. My fault totally but Anker stepped up and apologized and made things right when they really did not have to. As I said before the battery itself is great and if I had another need I would not hesitate to buy this again.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-03:</strong> I've been using my phone on international flights for reading books, listening to music, etc. I use this to charge it back up when it runs down.

I have been using it at work around lunch time when the battery level drops to 84%. I am using this portable charger with my Samsung Epic 4G Touch (Samsung Galaxy S II). I call it "The Mighty Mouse Charger" because it is small, very portable but it is powerful at 5600mAH. The price is nice. I showed it to people they thought it cost more than the $49 I paid for it.This portable charger charges at the same rate as the AC charger that comes with the phone. I can take this charger everywhere I go, it can be placed in a pants pocket with a lot of room to spare. The Samsung Epic 4G Touch has a battery life of 12 to 13 for medium use. I am a heavy user, I use the internet, Netflix, play games/music. Netflix alone can drain your phone battery pretty fast if you watch a more for one hour. I am still testing it out. You have to charge it for four to five hours the first time you get it. After that it should last 3 to 4 days before you have to charge it again.This Anker Power Bank charger really comes in handy. I highly recommend it. Oh I had the  New Trent iCruiser IMP1000 11000mAh External Battery Pack. It is 11,00mAh but it was too bulky too carry around without a backpack.

I have an iPhone 5 with a battery capacity of 1440 mAh and it successfully charged my battery about 3 times.I decided to keep a log of how many times I charged my iPhone 5 on ONE FULL charge of the Anker 5600 mAh battery.Start: 5:48PM, 6% batteryEnd: 7:27PM, 100%, 3 bars remaining (out of 4)Start: 2:23PM, 34% batteryEnd: 3:44PM, 100%, 2 bars remainingStart: 9:50AM, 15% batteryEnd: 11:58AM, 100%, 2 bars remainingStart: 9:50PM, 1% batteryEnd: 10:13PM, 22%, 0 bars remainingSo you can see that it did as advertised and charge my iPhone 5 a little more than 3 times. I was using my iPhone 5 a little bit while it was charging, so that may compensate for not starting at 0% every single time. It took about 1.5 hours to fully charge my iPhone 5 when the battery pack was fully charged. It then took about 2 hours to fully charge my iPhone 5 when the battery pack was less than half charged.It was a little weird in the sense that even though it showed 2 bars remaining, it only charged my iPhone 5 about 21% before it died. Therefore, the battery status indicator isn't the most reliable.Overall, this portable battery pack is excellent. It's not too big. It looks sleek and it even has a handy LED light (although it's not that bright). It also comes with a bunch of charging tips, including an non-lightning iPod/iPhone/iPad tip. This is one of the more reliable and highly rated battery packs. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a cost-efficient battery pack.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-24:</strong> So I purchased this product. I received it on time, as well as it being at a great price. The first day of having it, it was perfect. I charged it once and used it. However, when I went to charge it a second time, I plugged the cord in,and I went to bed. So when I woke up the next morning, to my surprise it wasn't charged. I started messing around with the cord and noticed it will only charge if the cord is bent down, and not all the way in. I thought it was just a cheap cord and tried it on multiple other cords and the same thing happened. If I have the cord plugged all the way in, and having it straight in the hole, it won't charge. Also I tried to bend the cord upwards, and it won't charge either. I do not know if the part where you plug it into, is defective or what, but I wish I didn't have to do this. I love the flashlight feature, and it holds about 3 charges. I would have easily given the product 5 stars but because I have to charge it this way, 1 star is due. I feel that having to charge it this way is totally unsafe. I noticed the product comes with a 18-month warranty. So if I have to do this everyday with the product, I am greatly debating about getting a replacement. I just wish I didn't have to deal with any hassle of the product not working right.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-24:</strong> This is such a handy item for when I'm away and when my gizmo runds out of juice-it does the job and is good looking too, with the cool blue lights.:-)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review21" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-17:</strong> Got this from reading the reviews from other people and decided to give it a try.

The easy attachments for the different phone adapters are good. It has kept the phone charged when I'm out and about all day so I don't have to worry about a dead phone.So far no complaints.

Thank you.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review33" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-22:</strong> I live on my Droid X2 phone.  Charge it overnight and keep it on charger in the car and, when I remember, around the house (I am retired, so no workplace to charge it at).Constant use for phone, text, email and internet - - the Droid doesn't last long when not on the charger despite power saving apps.  So, I have taken to carrying a rechargeable battery pack.My first one was a Radio Shack Enercell.  It was a weak contender.  Fully charged, it could only raise the phone battery 20% (e.g., 50% to 70%). I lived with it, until it died after 8 months (I will have to take that up with Radio Shack, later).Today, I received this unit - - ordered after I read the positive reviews.It came well charged, three out of four bars.  I charged it for three hours, until all four bars lit solid and plugged it into my Droid which was at 40%.  An hour or so later, the Droid was fully charged and, yet, the Anker still showed its four bars.  Of course, I knew that it must have used some power to resuscitate the Droid.However, I immediately plugged it in to my wife's LG Cosmo which was down to its three out of four bars and was due for a charging.  To make this second event even more challenging, I turned on the flashlight function while the phone was charging.Then, I began writing this review.While the phone continues to charge, let me tell you a bit about the included cables and adapters.  There are two cables, a 6 inch and a 24 inch (measurements are nominal) and seven adapters.  The adapters include the male micro that is needed to charge the Anker and, coincidently, the Droid X2.  The other adapters would be useful in charging a plethora of devices. I recognized a male mini adapter, an older Motorola adapter, the adapter that fits my Garmin, a circular input adapter plus others that I did not recognize.The cables and adapters are all white and I assume this is a marketing strategy to match some of the intended devices' original wires.  Weird, as the device itself is an attractive shiny Black. I would prefer black cables and adapters, but that does not detract from the unit.I already entered an Amazon order for black cables that do not require adapters.  I selected both 6 inch and 12 inch lengths, which I feel are optimal for my intended mode of use.  I already have numerous examples of any other length(s) I might need on a frequent basis.The supplied cables and adapters, however, will be kept close at hand for those inevitable occasions when family,friends or strangers need an electronic boost for devices other than those using the micro connection. I think I will be the hero quite often! Maybe, at some point in time, I will need them for an oddball device of my own (but, not for my Kindle as it uses the same micro connector).Just under an hour since I started charging the LG (with the flashlight consuming power, as well) and two things happened virtually at the same time:The LG showed fully chargedThe Anker display dropped to only three barsThe flashlight remained bright throughout.I am thrilled with this initial performance.  Extrapolating from these results, I estimate that I could get AT LEAST two complete charges for my Droid (as a retired teacher of mathematics, I love making these sorts of imputed calculations) which would last me 24+ hours of use between tethered charges (in the real world) that would be at least two days assuming the phone was not used in any way while I sleep.Alternatively, I could use the phone normally and as a night clock for a day and a half on a camping trip or during a power failure.Physically, the unit is compact and not unattractive (not that I care).  It seems well built and seems durable.Its only shortcomings, as far as I can see is the horrible insert that serves as an instruction sheet. Good thing that its use is intuitively obvious and relatively trivial (old math explanation for something that you don't want to explain in a proof).Also,there are two variations of this unit on the market with different capacities and designs.  You should investigate all of them and pick the one that seems to meet your projected needs.Five Stars and worth them!!!AFTER THREE MONTHS:WOW!  Continues to amaze, I am never without power.  What more can I say?Had a technical question and customer service provided, not only an answer, but great support.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review34" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-15:</strong> liked it so much, i bought two. bought the first one last summer for myself and picked up another for my wife a couple of weeks ago. this is really such a handy charger. i have an evo 4g LTE from sprint. i travel frequently and tend to watch a lot of movies and shows on my phone. with the charger connected, i am able to squeeze bw 7-8 hours of playtime when the charger is fully powered. would have given it five stars for its storage capacity, size, and weight. it gets 4 stars because the off switch is not very responsive and usually requires several attempts to power off the unit and flashlight which inadvertently gets turned on each time you try to hit the power button.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review35" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-22:</strong> The first one I got was a dud. the company was nice to replace it, and the new one works great.As a warning, if your phone is low on power, you may have to turn it off in order to get it to charge.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review36" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-26:</strong> Nice charger.

Performs as advertised and comes with a nice selection of cables/adapters that cover all my gadgets. Feels nice in hand with rounded edges and a high quality finish. The integrated flashlight is not especially bright but serves the intended purpose. Appears to be well constructed - time will tell. The 18 month warranty is longer than most competitors. I chose this specific model as it represents a nice balance of size/weight and capacity. I will probably snag another for the spouse.UPDATE 01/05/2013: After a few uses my unit began spontaneously disconnecting from various devices after 20-30 sec. Attempted the usual remediations including charging (twice), validating connections, consulting the manufactures web site. As other Amazon reviewers have reported similar symptoms I opted to return and purchase a competing product with similar specifications. Lowering star rating from 5 to 3 reflecting my recent experience while acknowledging it could have been a sample defect.UPDATE 02/05/2013: A Laptopmate Customer Support representative contacted me via email and offered to send a replacement unit. That unit has worked well for ~10 days paired with an iPhone 5. I can recharge the phone 2-3 times which permits all day operation under heavy use. While I still need to carry a Lightning to USB Cable (Anker does not supply a Lightning tip) I do not have to lug along a charger or worry about finding an outlet in an unfamiliar location. Nice! I still prefer operational nuances and the accessories including with a remarkably similar competing unit but the Anker variant now ranks a close second.

I got this Anker (and an extra lightning cable) to use primarily as an iPhone charger, but it's so versatile that I can use it for just about anything I carry with me: Kindle, camera, bluetooth headphone, iPad, whatever.  The battery holds about 2 1/2 full iPhone 5 charges, with a minimum efficiency rate of 70%.  The new iPad takes a lot more juice than an iPhone, so you won't get a full charge out of the Astro.  (I can't say how much because I don't use it for my IPad -- at least, I haven't yet.)  Other devices will take varying amounts of juice, depending on the size of their battery.  But everything than can charge with a USB cable will be able to draw power from this Anker external battery.The battery itself is 3 3/4" long by 1 1/2" wide by 3/4" thick.  It has blue lighted dots on the top to show you how much power remains, a useful feature if you want to charge a device but don't want to use up everything you have.  It comes with a USB charging cord (but no wall outlet plug -- you supply that yourself if you want to charge it more quickly); adaptors for micro-USB, mini-USB, and traditional -- not lightning -- Apple connections; and a soft mesh pouch for holding everything.  If you want to charge an iPhone 5 or, say, a camera with a proprietary connector, you have to supply your own USB cables.  The battery has an LED flashlight on one end that provides a focused, close-up beam; in my opinion, this is strictly an emergency light for dimly illuminating a small area -- a nice feature but nothing exciting.  Make sure that you charge the battery in the "in" connection, and plug in your to-be-charged devices in the "out" port.  If you aren't paying attention, the difference is easy to overlook.This battery feels solid and looks well-made.  I'm glad that the lack of battery cases for the iPhone 5 made me turn to Anker.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review47" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-02:</strong> This is my second purchase from Anker.Both times the product received exceeded my expectations.The styling of the external battery is really nice.It will come in very handy for those times when no power is around and heavy use of my mobile is expected.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review48" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-30:</strong> This takes long to charge up.

Ill be traveling soon and was debating whether to purchase a large battery for my phone and get a larger back cover, to get a case with an inbuilt extended battery, or this external battery. I decided to get this battery because its the largest one! 5600mah!! thats triple my battery size! and i can use it to charge many devices such as my phone iPad, and iPod, or anything else i may need. REMEMBER THAT FOR APPLE PRODUCTS YOU NEED TO USE YOUR OWN CABLE. i have a samsung galaxy s2 which is a very light and thin device, so this extended battery is definitely thicker and heavier than my phone, but something i can easily fit in my pockets (i wear skinny jeans!) and carry around without a hassle.Pros:-has a pretty powerful led flashlight that will run 250 hours until the battery dies or until you recharge it-comes with a long cable and a short one that u can use. (the original long cable i received was defective; HOWEVER, i contacted customer service and they were VERY helpful and sent me a long cable for free, which arrived just 3 days later. They were quick to respond and very courteous.)-you can charge many different devices because it comes with many different heads that you can attach to the cable-has blue light indicators that tell you how much charge is left-very simple to operateCons:-It has none!! for a 5600 mah battery, its very portable!i would definitely recommend this over any other extended battery. for the price your getting the most juice possible!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review58" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-17:</strong> works awesome lasts long in stand by. i used it on my friends because their battery died. they were shocked with the results. they loved it . it charges most phones</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review59" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-23:</strong> This external battery has saved my butt several times while on long road trips (on motorcycle).

Read the description again: it clearly says compatible with the full line of Apple products including iPhone, iPad, and iPods. BUT, it doesn't come with the Apple connector??? WTF? So, of course, I go back and read the description, and yes, AT THE VERY BOTTOM of the description, it does say that the Apple connector is not included. OMG, seriously?? C'mon Anker. I've been so happy with your higher capacity batteries, but you really need to not mislead people with your description of your product. A real bummer.EDIT 10/28/11: OK, I'm softening my stance on this because I like Anker products. As their customer service has noted, you can still just use your own iPod cable attached to the Powerpack to charge. I still think the title of this product is misleading, or that the fact that no Apple plug is not included be put in the title. Also, another suggestion would be that a small pouch or case be included to hold the power pack and all the various adapters you would bring with you.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review61" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-05:</strong> I need this jaja, this external battery let my use my phone all the day because have so much battery.

But now, I wanted something smaller and more portable battery for travel.  I first tried a Maxboost Defender Air iPhone case, but the Air ended up causing noticeable signal loss in weak coverage areas and had to be returned.Next i tried this Anker Astro 5600mAh.  The first Anker I received had a charging problem....I had it plugged in an entire work-day, and it still only showed 1-bar of charge (out of 4).  I charged it all night long (18+ hours total?), and it still only reached 3-bars.  After contacting Anker via e-mail, they quickly offered to ship a replacement.  The replacement Anker Astro works great so far.  Solid construction, predictable charging times, and it is delivering the expected battery life I was looking for.  So I'm giving it 5-stars based on this second unit, and the responsive customer service I received from Anker.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review64" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-12:</strong> Very nice size with excellent features.

This is b/c of internal electronics that consumes 30%. On an empty S4, a charged pack is sufficient for a charge and a half.  You cannot charge this pack and the phone at the same time. The multi prongs for charging are of low quality - they are loose, you'll have to &#34;play&#34; the cable to have a good connection. Buy/use a dedicated charging cable (about $2). That being said, it fit the purpose. Small enough to carry on a plane or on the go.

It's a lifesaver when traveling.  If you're going on a trip, buy this.To the reviewers who are complaining that this battery will not charge a 1400mAh battery exactly four times (1400 * 4 = 5600), energy does not transfer from one point to another with 100% efficiency, at least not at room temperature. When Anker claims the capacity of this battery is 5600mAh they are saying that it will output that much power, not that it will completely charge four 1400mAh batteries.This battery can charge your phone and be charged at the same time but it takes about as long as charging one and then the other. Essentially, if you plug the Anker battery into the charger and your phone into the Anker battery, your phone will charge first and the Anker battery will charge when your phone's battery is full. It would be faster to charge them both separately but if you have one charger and two cables it's a good option.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review72" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-04:</strong> I got this external battery mainly to recharge my Samsung Galaxy S3 on the fly while it's on my belt.I use my phone a lot, watching and taking video. The latter really sucks down the battery. But with this external backup, I can have it in my pocket and connect it to my phone while it's on my belt. Perfect setup.Initially the unit I received was defective. It would randomly make the phone think it was being plugged in and unplugged many times a minute (the phone would make the "power connected" sound). It would still charge, but something clearly wasn't right. Thinking it might be the provided cable and adapter, I tried the USB cable I use for the phone to connect to my PC. It did the same thing, so it had to be the unit.I contacted Anker support. They were prompt, polite, and responsive. They suggested trying a different cable, which I had already done and told them so in my email, but it's not a big deal that they missed that. When I told them I already had, they offered a refund or a replacement. I chose replacement. I had the new unit within a couple days, and it worked as expected. I shipped back the old unit with a call tag supplied by Anker, so there was no cost to me at all.So, here are the Pros and ConsPros:- Lots of power! I can charge my S3 at least two full times.- Compact. Fits in my pocket easily.Cons:- Still sometimes acts as if the phone is being plugged in and unplugged when it's just sitting still on my desk and charging the phone. But it's very seldom. If it gets worse, well, they have an 18 month warranty.- There's no way to disable the flashlight. I don't need it, but did purchase it knowing it was there. The problem is that sometimes the flashlight will get turned on while it's in my pocket and I don't know it. This is the main reason I didn't give it 5 stars.My unit is different than the one pictured here while I'm typing this review. Not sure what's up with that.Overall, I'd recommend it.Update 10-29-13: The replacement device started acting up recently. It was doing the same thing as the one I was originally shipped. My Galaxy S3 would sometimes start making noise as if it were being unplugged and plugged back in repeatedly, approximately 30 times in a couple minutes. It wasn't happening as often as the original, but more often than i'm comfortable with. The battery pack doesn't seem to be holding a charge well either, since it's only been 3+ months, I thought that odd. At one point, after being fully charged overnight, and after being used for only 30 mins or so, there was only one bar remaining. Other times after being fully charged, and not being used, it would be missing a bar the next morning. Something wasn't right with it.So I contacted Anker again. They were very polite and are offering me a full refund. I've decided to accept it and will be purchasing a different brand. I really wanted this to work, but I don't feel I can trust the device to last.I've reduced my rating to 3 stars. The device was well-built, but for me, it had problems. Anker's customer service was excellent, which is worth the 3 stars to me. I may try them again in the future.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review73" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-15:</strong> I bought this one for my so for Christmas because he was so impressed with my Anker Astro3.

I've tried on my Samsung 3, an iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS and iPad 2, and it only charges consistently if you keep pressing the button. Otherwise, most of the time, charging stops...period. On most attempts, it will only start charging the device after you press the button but stop after about 10 seconds. I've drained/fully charged and tried my own cables to no avail. I'm giving this product 3 stars ONLY because I see the vendor has been very responsive to customers and offer an 18 month warranty...however, I'm a stiggler for first time quality products that work out of the box, so I'm choosing to go with another brand.** For those that are countering negative users reviews on this product, look at the pattern of what's being said. I've seen other users with this same issue. I've seen people scrutinize others for negative reviews on this product for various reasons including complaints about no Apple adapter. What's odd is that MINE CAME WITH an Apple adaptor..! I didn't expect one, but what's also odd is the product description says (direct quote) "2. Many Apple devices must detect a custom USB pin design before they will properly charge. The Anker power wire is custom designed to ensure compatibility between Anker Astro and your Apple device. Using your own wire may result in slow or even no charge. Please use the Anker power wire provided". So their own product description eludes to an included adapter!I tend to be suspicious of overly zealous "users" who counter any negative reviews. I would suspect they are affiliates of the product maker and not real Amazon customers...paid to counter any negative reviews on the product. Go by what real people who have purchased the product say.UPDATED: I have to give this seller credit. They did everything they could to make this right. They even called me and sent me a new one for free. The new one arrived, and it works. You can't beat that kind of customer service.

These use a proprietary charging cable and are notorious for being hard to charge if you don't have access to your typical US 120V outlet.  I've been playing around with it for about a week and have tried to distill my comments down to a few paragraphs.First, you need to charge the heck out of this thing when you get it.  Mine appeared to be fully charged when I got it (3 of 4 blue lights were on) but when I plugged the Nook into it, the charge went away almost immediately with no effect on the Nook.  Andre Frederick wrote a review that said to charge the Anker for at least 5 - 6 hours before first use and he is absolutely right.  I'd go one step further and recommend that you let it bake overnight.After a few experiments with my Nook Color, I found that this scenario worked best for me:* I charged the Anker completely.* Starting with a *completely* discharged Nook Color (it wouldn't even turn on), I connected the Nook to the Anker with the Nook's proprietary cable.  You must use the Nook Color's proprietary cable and since the newer Nook Tablet is a variation of the Nook Color, I'm betting you have to use the proprietary cable for the Nook Tablet as well.  Then I hit the button on the Anker to start charging.* It took about 4 minutes for the Nook's cable indicator to turn orange, showing that the Nook is charging.  Not sure why it takes that long to get to the charging state but I don't really care.* About 8 minutes later, the Nook woke up and booted itself (normal behavior).  A couple of minutes after that, I turned WiFi and BluTooth off and did a hard shutdown so the Nook wouldn't be using power at the same time I was trying to supply power.* About 2.5 hours later the Anker went from 4 blue lights to 3.  I powered on the Nook and noted that it appeared to be about 40 to 50% charged.  I turned the Nook back off.* About 1.5 hours later the Anker went from 3 blue lights to 2.  I powered on the Nook, ran an app and found that it was 56% charged.  I can go for hours at that level so I decided to move on.* I unplugged the Nook and plugged in my iPod Touch, which still had enough battery to start up, but the battery icon showed that thin red "you're out of power" thing so it was nearly dead.  An hour and 15 minutes later it was fully charged and the Anker still had some mojo.* I plugged the Anker into my ancient Moto RAZR which had around 50% battery and let it cook.  After about 40 minutes it was topped up completely.* Having run out of devices to play with, I plugged the Anker back into my Nook Color.  I had played about 10 hands of Words With Friends on the Nook while the Anker was busy with the iPod and the Moto.  After about a half an hour, the final blue light on the Anker started flashing vigorously so I disconnected the Nook.  The Nook battery showed at 51%.  I think that's pretty decent, especially given the bargain price of this item.The bottom line for me:Charging less-hungry devices seems to be a breeze for the Anker.  I suspect iPad users will be as pleased with the results as I was with my iPod Touch (I will try it on an iPad and post an update).Charging a Nook Color (or presumably Nook Tablet) will tax the Anker, but it will keep the Nook usable for far longer than the internal battery.  And the Anker will actually charge the thing.  There are many "solutions" out there that won't charge a Nook Color/Tablet at all.For me, this is a handy device and a reasonably priced travel accessory.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review81" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-29:</strong> the reason that i m gave 3 stars is that the plug for iphone / ipad doesnt work anymore after 8 months of usage and raised to 4 star for the good customer service.it works well with my other iphone charger.the capacity is still the same as 8 months ago so i m pretty happy about the battery it self.i use this product twice a week and it works well everytime i use it.i liked the fact that it comes with multiple plugs but apparently one is not working anymore.Update Nov 6th 2013Anker customer service contacted me after reading my comments.and they sent me a new iphone plug for the charger, hope that it lasts longer than the previous one.tkx for the excellent customer service!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review82" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-24:</strong> Based on my first review, saying that not all the indicator lights were working, the company contacted me. They immediately had me return the item and replaced it. I've had several follow-up emails from them. This is the kind of company I want to give my business to.The second Power Bank Pack seems to work just fine. I'm sure it will take me awhile to fully determine the quality of the product, but as I have already mentioned, the company takes quality seriously. I'm very impressed and would definitely order from them again.I like the indicator lights showing the amount of power left. And, I like the flashlight feature. In a power failure this product should come in quite handy. I keep it in my purse and can use it to charge my iPhone, iPad, Kindle, etc. It has a USB connector. It doesn't include the lightening connector, but I just use the cord that came with my iPhone, so no problem.What I don't like: The power button is on the side of the item and easily turns on in a pocket, purse or laptop case. That turns the flashlight on & discharges the unit. Then it has no power and is useless. I have other similar products that have the power buttons on the end and they aren't turned on as easily.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review83" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-09:</strong> I bought this external backup battery to replace another one that I had gotten (a couple of years before) that had stopped charging my phone.I bought the first one because it could be charged via Solar panel OR USB connection.This Anker Astro 5600mAh can only be charged via USB but it does come with FOUR different connector tips which makes it versatile.It also comes with two cable lengths---the shorter one is 8-3/4" from tip to tip (not just the length of the cable) and the otheris about 30", again adding versatility to this product.I didn't realize when I placed my order that it has a flashlight...another bonus feature!Now I've discovered that my older battery DOES work and that the cable was faulty.But, rather than returning this Anker battery, I'll keep both because of the provision of the different tips.It does feel good in the hand and I think it'll be more powerful than my old external battery.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review84" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-05:</strong> Delivered on time with a partial charge, in case you needed it.

Phone battery level was at 30% and took about two and a half hours to recharge to 100%. I got two full phone charges before having to recharge the battery pack.  I'm giving it 4 stars only because I haven't had much time to try it out.Added information:  Now that I've had a few months to use this product I wanted to add that it has worked great.  It does take a few hours to fully recharge when it's drained but that's no big deal.  I have now given this product 5 stars but the biggest reason for that was for the great customer service from Anker.  I bent the mini USB adapter while it was charging my phone.  I went on their web site to buy some extra adapters and could not find them listed, so I contacted their customer service via email.  They are sending me a free replacement because "they value me as a customer".  I was shocked and even made it clear that I would purchase the adapter.  The free replacement is on the way.  How can I not recommend with customer service like that?</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review86" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-30:</strong> I needed to replace my Dell laptop battery last year and in my research and review process I finallybought an Anker replacement battery for my laptop.

Which tends to happen about everyday.  It seems VERY well made and appears to have a ton of power storing ability.  However, you can't charge your phone, while its plugged in.  To me this is very bad, because my plan was to have my wife keep it charging beside the bed, and just plug her phone into it.  But since that doesn't work, we have to have yet another freakin wire.  So now, we have an iphone charger cord, ipad charger cord, and now this battery charger cord.  It also did not come with an iphone 5 lightning charge cord, but thats not a big deal, since it has a usb slot to plug into to power your devices.If you don't think the "not charging your phone while charging it" is a problem, i would say go for it! because it seems like an incredibly well built device.UPDATE:  After posting my review, i was immediately contacted by Anker who offered to replace my charger with one of their other models.

I have been using it at work around lunch time when the battery level drops to 84%. I am using this portable charger with my Samsung Epic 4G Touch (Samsung Galaxy S II). I call it &#34;The Mighty Mouse Charger&#34; because it is small, very portable but it is powerful at 5600mAH. The price is nice. I showed it to people they thought it cost more than the $49 I paid for it.This portable charger charges at the same rate as the AC charger that comes with the phone. I can take this charger everywhere I go, it can be placed in a pants pocket with a lot of room to spare. The Samsung Epic 4G Touch has a battery life of 12 to 13 for medium use. I am a heavy user, I use the internet, Netflix, play games/music. Netflix alone can drain your phone battery pretty fast if you watch a more for one hour. I am still testing it out. You have to charge it for four to five hours the first time you get it. After that it should last 3 to 4 days before you have to charge it again.This Anker Power Bank charger really comes in handy. I highly recommend it. Oh I had the New Trent iCruiser IMP1000 11000mAh External Battery Pack. It is 11,00mAh but it was too bulky too carry around without a backpack. I use to carry it in a hard drive case that had a belt loop.

My only suggestion is to keep an eye on your device while it charges. You do not want to let your devices overcharge with an external battery pack like this as it is known to cause damage to the battery if you overcharge often for long periods of time.

The downside of this charger is that the cords and various attachments one must muck around with every time you need to charge it (must be plugged into PC to charge it), then a different adapter to plug into your cell phone to charge that.  The cord and adapters all come with charger, but are a pain, and if you separate these small items from the charger the charger itself is of no use.March 22, 2013; After using this charger for awhile I am surprised at how good it works.  The backup charges it gives are very good and makes carrying the small device and cord very worthwhile. I also occasionally use the charger to give my iPad an extra charge, something I hadn't bought it for but is a nice dual use of the charger.

I dont know why, must be something software related. But before, I could get through the day and still have 50% battery left. Now, I have to recharge it at like 5pm, otherwise it will die. So, I decided to get a portable charger, so it didnt die when I was out and about.ALSO, I am going to study abroad in a week. So, I wanted a portable charger to take with me.Good decision! This charger especially. It is such a great value for the money! I was torn between this one, and the model above it, but decided that the smaller size would fit my travels better. And since I only have one iphone I need to charge twice a day max, I wouldnt run into capacity problems anyway.PROS:-charges my iphone 2-3 times-has a nifty flashlight-very portable-sleekCONS:-sometimes the light indicators seem off. Like, it will be at 2/4 lights for a while, then drop to 1/4, then immediately die.-no other cons, really...NOTE: you do have to fully use the charge and fully recharge it a few times to get its maximum capacity. I used this as my sole charger for a week to get it drained and refilled quickly. Once you do that, it'll be fine.Overall, wonderful charger. Also, the friendly emails from Anker quickly thanking me for my purchase was a nice touch. Very great communication, Anker. That seems to be a thing lost these days in commercialism.

It will charge them both to over 50% power or one of them to 100% power with battery to spare.  The 4 blue lights reveal the charge level it holds.  The flashlight is prevented from accidental turn on as it requires a press-and-hold function.  This is a compact item with a LOT of battery back up power and better than the smaller lipstick types that give 20% power to your devices.  It comes with a USB-to-micro cable and a small pouch.

This thing did help me in some dire situations. The LED indicator is pretty nice.But at the same time, my Galaxy Nexus broke (the screen went green, then off, then never on again) when I was charging from this. It was always hot. I notice with my other devices since then (HTC One, Nexus 5), they also get hot sometimes too when I am using it. I am not sure what the cause is. But I would be careful and not use this every day, because it might be hurtful for your battery.I wonder if the next generation version has fixed this problem? If someone can alert me if they have, I would gladly upgrade.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review123" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-23:</strong> I purchased the battery for my Droid Razr, a bigger battery suck there never has been!  I charged it up from my computer, and it seemed to take a charge just fine.  The LED flashlight was bright and worked well.  However, when it was set to charge my phone, it only charged for 10 minutes and stopped, then only for 30 seconds at a time after that.Anker was great at getting back to me and replacing the battery at absolutely no charge.  I had the new one within days of the problem.  And the new one seems to be working great.  It occasionally will shut off after an initial period of charging, but one press of the button and it charges consistently after that.  I've never had another problem.  One charge has been enough to almost fully charge my phone twice.So, you will eventually get one that works, and their customer service is good.  In my opinion, it shouldn't have happened at all, but in this day and age, that seems to be the way.  Simply replace a part of product that doesn't work or hasn't been adequately tested.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review124" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-03:</strong> Excellent, this is one of the best portable bathery that i ever try, its very practical and charge my phone (Galaxy S3) very fast</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review125" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-29:</strong> Bought this to keep my phone alive on long day trips.

This is a terrific gadget.  It works extremely well.  I have bought three others that are another brand and look like it (they look similar and like they were made in the same factory, but one of those was DOA. That brand was PowerGen).This brand (Anker) has been a flawless experience so far.  These charge well, recharge devices really well (remember to turn on the power button when you plug in something you want to charge.)  There is a lot of power packed in here for this size.  It's compact, but solid and heavy for its size (as are all batteries).  The flashlight is an unasked for pleasantly useful extra. When I travel, I keep this by the bedside all the time now, as the flashlight works great and is really easy to use.I give this 5 stars because it does what it's suppose to and does it really well.

She wants to use her Vizio Android tablet extensively on the five to six hour flight.  I knew that using it on such an extended trip would suck the battery dry in her tablet before we landed so I looked for a backup.  The Anker Astro external battery pack and charger looked like the answer.We have not had a chance to put the battery pack to the test on that trip, but I will comment on first impressions and preliminary experience.  The battery pack arrived already charged up and I tried it out on several devices.  It completely charged up my iPod quickly and it worked just as we hoped with the Vizio tablet.  The Anker Astro was capable of administering a charge over and above providing power to the tablet while it was in operation.  And that is what we wanted from the `external battery'.I am not sure how many times a fully charged Anker Astro would re-charge a tablet battery, but that is not how it will be used.  We want the Anker Astro to maintain the charge in a Vizio tablet and to extend the time the device can be used.I have not tried to completely charge the battery in my iPad2 with the Anker Astro, but I did connect it long enough to see that it was working.  I am sure it is capable of doing the job with that power hungry device as well.The Anker Astro is relatively small, very well made and feels quite substantial.  It will easily fit in a purse or pocket. The blue indicator lights work perfectly to show the remaining capacity of the battery pack.  It operates with one control button.  It has a single USB out-port and an in-port that connects to the provide AC wall charger with the special cable--also included. The flashlight is a nice touch too.  The unit appears to be a quality product.There is a whole bunch of adapters in the box that should fit almost every phone or tablet on the planet.Although we have yet to make that trip to Hawaii the Anker Astro will be going along with us and I am confident it will keep my wife's Vizio tablet powered up on the flight.  Heck, it might even have some juice left over that I can use with my iPad2.WE MADE THAT TRIP TO HAWAIIThe charger worked perfectly and my wife used it to power her Vizio tablet for at least an hour toward the end of our flight to Honolulu.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review133" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-24:</strong> I use this model the most out of all of my other Anker products.

In the end I had my wife order this because the reviews are great and the customer service (if ever needed) appears to be outstanding. I'm the kind of person who believes in 'you get what you pay for', and despite the cost of this battery not being too exorbitant (nor cheap!) I am willing to shell out a few more dollars on the customer service aspect alone.The battery arrived with about a 1/2 charge, so I went ahead and plugged it into my iPhone 5 to juice it up. I was below 20% on my phone battery and the Anker 5600 gave me a complete charge. So I needed to charge something else to drain this thing, so I grabbed my iPad 2 which had about 88% charge left in it and plugged it in. Surely the iPad would use up the remaining charge left in this external battery. It didn't! So with 1 blue LED still left on the Anker external I plugged it into my wife's Samsung Galaxy 10" note. The tablet had less than 50% battery life so this would finally drain the external battery we purchased and allow me to give it a charge.The first charging cycle only charged the battery about 2/3 to 3/4 full. 3 of the 4 LED indicator lights on it were on with the third light flashing. The battery would not charge beyond this point, but I wasn't concerned. So I set about discharging the Anker Astro 5600 mAh external battery once again. Charged my iPhone (again), the Samsung Note (to 100%) and was able to get nearly a full charge on my son's iPhone 4. And this is with a battery at 2/3 - 3/4 full! So I'm on my 3rd charging cycle now and it still won't take a full charge, but each time I do charge it I am gaining a little more power from it -in terms of charges-. Like most everything else I've read about this particular battery, it's phenomenal and I can't wait to put it to the real test in two weeks when our family goes on holiday to San Diego for Comic Con. After that test I will update this review of how it fared with my power-abusive ways against all things electronic. So far, Anker I love it.**UPDATEI've had this for well over a month now and it's fantastic. I've discharged and recharged it multiple times now and have finally been able to get it to take a full charge. Which, I'm happy to say, will completely charge my iPhone 5 2 full times (100% battery drain to full charge) and partially again (between 24% to 38%) on a 3rd attempt. It's great because I can charge my phone anytime I need to without having to find an electrical outlet. It's a beautifully designed product with the functionality to match. I'm very happy with this! Up from 4/5 to 5/5 stars for the Anker Astro 5600 mAh external battery.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review146" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-20:</strong> this Astro 5600mAh Portable Power Bank Pack External Battery is very good I am using it to recharge my Iphone it works great.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review147" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-27:</strong> The first day I got this item and charged it to a full charge.

The charger did a great job and quickly charged all their phones without any problems. I still even had a bar of battery life left to probably charge another phone ~%50. It's small and easily fits into any regular pocket or clutch purse. A big plus about this charger over other options is that it's recharged via a micro USB port. So I just use the included micro usb cable and bought a micro USB-Apple convert plug (neXplug brand) and I'm good to go for charging almost any smartphone and with minimal wires and tangle!

I figure it might extend the usefulness until I get a new phone in a few months -- and then work with the new phone, as well as other devices today.It will charge my GNex twice to full capacity, and also works great with a Nexus 7 tablet. The weight is very reasonable, hardly noticeable in my backpack. I also like the idea of the &#34;flashlight&#34; LED ... hardly a major selling point, but a minor nice to have accessory when traveling.The main limitation is that it does not come with the AC wall outlet transformer part; you have to either use one you already have, or  plug the (very short) included cable into some other powered USB outlet (on your computer, car, etc.) That's not a big deal since I have many of those, but I wanted to point it out.I'd happily purchase again, and have showed it off to a few folks as &#34;the latest device I bought that I'm delighted with.&#34; (I'm not sure they're impressed, but no one has shown me anything else better yet!)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review149" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-06:</strong> I used this for 3 weeks last month while I traveled on a plane, bus and car.  I had lots of time just sitting around waiting on a flight or a bus, and I kept my smartphone charged up by connecting it to this charger.  Times when I had an outlet available I charged the anker and other times when I had no access to power, this was my go to.  The BEST thing I love about this charger is the size.  I kept it in my rear pocket, hooked up via a retractable cable to my phone which I kept holstered to my belt, so everything was secured on my person when I was charging my phone.  Sometimes, I talked on the phone while it was charging and it never got in my way.I also own a couple of New Trent battery chargers, and I use those to mainly charge up my PC Tablets while traveling.  Those are really great chargers too, but I have the 9900 and the 11000 mah models that are larger than this anker, but they all serve a purpose.  So, if you're looking for a nice simple charger that will fit easily in your pocket or purse, and you only need it for recharging a cell, then this is worth looking into.UPDATE: JUNE 2013 -  I've been traveling in Europe since May, and have used this charger daily to keep my camera, cell phone and kindle charged. I have 2 so when one is charging I can easily use the other. I definetly recommend buying at least one, but having 2 if you're traveling. My original one was purchased in Mar 2012, and still going strong. Thanks to distributor and amazon for selling these at such a bargain price!UPDATE: OCTOBER 2013  -  I just returned from my European trip, and these chargers were a lifesaver. I would be sightseeing all day recharging my camera's battery and phone battery on just one of these chargers. Then when I returned to my accommodations I would use my 2nd one while I charged the one I used all day. I used it while charging my phone and on the net via WiFi for hours on a layover. All airports don't have convenient charging stations or outlets. This has to be the best item I took along on my trip.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review150" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-05:</strong> This product is worth every dollar you pay.

I'm also using my iPhone simultaneously to record my ride real-time using the MapMyRide app.  Using bluetooth, 3G and 2 web apps at the same time sucks the juice from my iPhone in no time.  So, I purchased a top-tube-mounted XLAB X-Large Rocket Pocket Bag (yep, Amazon, very roomy), stuck the Anker 5600mAh battery pack in it and connected it to my iPhone with the short cable (provided with the battery pack).  The Anker will also recharge my headset with the Anker-provided cable.  Now, I can ride for hours and my only concern is the cost of my ATT data plan, which is extortionate.  By the way, in addition to using a wall plug, I can keep the Anker charged by plugging it into the USB port on my MacBookPro.  Two additional notes:  (1) when it arrived, the Anker had a charge sufficient to illuminate 3 of the LED lights.  After a full charge, all 4 lights will glow when you press the button.  (2) A number of reviewers have expressed disappointment that a wall plug adapter is not included and downgraded the product accordingly, unfairly in my opinion.  Although a wall plug adapter is not explicitly excluded in the contents, perhaps the vendor could make that point a bit more clearly.  That said, it's not necessary to purchase the Anker wall plug adapter.  Use the one that came with your iPhone, if you have one.  It's universal.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review155" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-16:</strong> These things are magical.  I have a two hour train commute so if I have no phone battery it's not a good thing.  I carry this in my bag and it's good for just over 2 full 0-100% charges to my iphone 5.

One day I used it to charge my phone to full from 50% - twice - and in between that it charged a colleague's iPhone from about zero to 70%. After those three charging events, this charger still had juice left!--------------------------------------Original review follows:I just got my first smartphone without a user-swappable battery. Sometimes I'm away from a charging outlet for several hours during a day, and even the freshest phone batteries tend to wilt under my phone use habits. I carried a fresh battery and often swapped batteries by the end of the day.I bought this as backup for my new phone, for when I'm out and about. In its little drawstring bag, with the longer included cord and the tips, it weighs in on my kitchen scale at 5.8 ounces. I've used this to charge my phone fully, here at home as a test, and it did so, and still showed it had lots of charge left. Much easier to use than the whole hassle of opening the phone back and swapping out batteries. And you don't have to power the phone down/up to start using it. It also came with a tip I can use with my iPods, a plus when traveling.I also bought aNew Trent, 10W 5V/2A Dual Port high-speed USB AC wall chargerwhich works well to charge this battery pack from a wall outlet, which I prefer to relying on USB charging.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review157" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-11:</strong> This is a great gadget for those times when there is no outlet around to charge a cell phone!

I was so satisfied with it that I've now purchased two of the 5600 mAh chargers. They are intelligently designed, straight-forward, compact, no-nonsense devices, very reasonably priced, and the built-in flashlight is a logical and useful bonus.No more feeling like I must ration use of my phone, or avoid using its GPS, etc., for fear of running out of battery.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review163" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-23:</strong> This item was originally purchased too use when I am out on the town or away from a location where I could charge my phone.

So far, it works perfectly.  I mainly purchased this because I no longer drive and my Droid 3 is sort of my electronic Swiss Army knife of devices.  I walk an hour to work each way and even with battery saver, by the end of a full shift, I'm nearly out of battery power.  It charges my Droid 3 as fast if not faster than the original Motorola wall charger.  It also works with my Plantronics bluetooth earpiece.  I have an old Sony Reader which I will try with it, but I don't use it much anymore.It came with 3 bars still available and is charging my Droid as I type.  It works well with the included cables (micro-USB) and the generic micro-USB cable as well.  I plan to use it while at work with the Astro in my back pocket charging the phone in the front.  I will also be able to test it in a few weeks with my sister's Blackberry, a Nokia Windows phone of her husband's, and my Mother's iPad mini.  I'll update when I get a chance to test them out.For now, I am very pleased with the product and its workmanship which is very high-quality.  I can see from other feedback that Anker makes customer service a very high priority.  All I can say is I'm impressed both by the product and by a company that evidently really cares about their customers.  A lot of the bigger fish out there could take a lesson from Anker.6/27/13 Update:  After more than a month of usage, I have to say this still is working perfectly.  I have been regularly charging my Motorola Droid 3, Plantronics Bluetooth, and Galaxy Tab 2 7.0.  The only issue I've noted is that when I get down to 2 bars, it will be near the end of its ability to charge.  This just implies that the bars are more exponential rather than linear in nature.  Regardless it still keeps me in charge most of the week before I need to recharge the Anker itself.  I do wish the micro-USB adapter included would seat more securely, but that seems to be more a product of the design of the micro-USB size than anything else.  The cable connection used on the Tab 2 and iDevices now makes a lot of sense.  That connection won't jimmy loose while moving.1/13/2014 Update: Am using this nearly everyday and after 6+ months, it is still holding a full charge. I can use it for charging my phone all week and only recharge it at that time.  This is the best portable charger I have ever used.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review168" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-02:</strong> I am very pleased with this product so far. I have used it to fully charge my iphone 4s two consecutive times, without recharging the the astro in between. I have not tried for three charges, but two should be all I ever need from this device. It is super easy to use, and I was pleasantly surprised with the various adapters that came included with the Astro. I mainly just wanted something to throw in my carry on for business trips, but I can see myself using the astro even more with the various adapters. The LED light on the bottom is a nice little perk. It is very compact as advertised, but feels well made and durable. I would highly recommend this product over other bigger clunkier devices.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review169" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-02:</strong> Works week when it works.

It takes a while to charge, but keeps a charge for months if you don't use it often.  It charges my devices really fast. About twice as fast as using a wall charger.

I wear carpenter jeans, this battery stays in my front left pocket and I wind the cord up and stick it in my leg pocket so it's out of the way of everything else. This battery has proven useful so many times for me. If my phone is running dead all i got to do is connect it to this battery and it charges it up completely. It has enough juice to power it up 3 or 4 times on a single charge. It even has a built in flashlight, how cool is that? My only complaint about this though is it takes FOREVER for it to charge the battery itself up. But it's a big battery and holds a lot so I suppose it needs to take a while to charge up. But it just takes so long that it's kind of frustrating. I can plug it up when it's completely dead and sleep for 8hrs and it still won't be completely charged.  But it's an Excellent battery nonetheless.

When I carry this backup in a soft camera bag pocket, the power button gets inadvertently activated and the flashlight eventually drains the cell. I'm tired of finding this backup nearly depleted when I need it. I was pleasantly surprised to be contacted by the seller with an offer to replace my Astro with an updated version that has a 5-second time delay on the flashlight mode to help prevent the power drain I described. The replacement came quickly and I was provided a return shipping label to send back the first Astro 5600. I'm impressed with this exceptional support and service and have upgraded my rating. The time delay should address my problem. I also think that the power switch requires a firmer press to engage.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review176" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-12:</strong> I am very impressed with this product, not only it last for a long time and it saved me from running out of batteries multiple times on a single charge.

I have a Droid Charge with a 3600mAh extended battery (double the standard battery) this external battery gives me second full charge with a "rescue reserve" (I presume it would give me 3 full charges on standard equipment). I was extremely thankful to have this device in my pocket.Pros:On one occasion I had drained my battery with phone calls before boarding a flight, I used this device to charge my phone while watching downloaded movies and it managed to recharge my phone a bit while doing that. When I landed at my connection I missed my flight and was thankful I could leave my phone plugged into this device while making phone calls. I'm sure I looked a bit odd with my phone plugged into my jeans pocket but I was able to make calls so I could make a new flight, charge my phone and still have enough juice for a full evening at my destination.Recently, when flying over night. I had used my phone all day and drained it. I plugged my phone into this device and I had a full charge when landing in the morning. This was critical as I needed my phones GPS for navigation and I could not find the port for my car charger in the rental car.After a full day of work use, my battery was drained. While at a business dinner I turned my phone off, plugged it in and placed both devices in my pocket. After dinner I had a 60% charge which was enough to make the phone useful for an evening out.Cons:It seems that you can be plugged into the device and it will be off. You have to tap the button on the front to turn it on. Two taps turns on the light. If you accidentally tap the button while it is in your pocket it can either turn on the light or turn off the charging feature. I presume this was to make the flight attendants happy so you can turn the device off. It's a battery. An off button on a battery doesn't help anyone.On one occasion I had left the device plus my phone alone for an hour hoping for a charge. Nothing happened because the device was off. That's very very annoying.I am reasonably happy with this purchase. For the price and the amp hours this is a *very* good deal. Small annoyances aside, it is a good buy and just the right size for travelling.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review178" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-14:</strong> In ordering this, I wasn't sure how many mAH that I would need so I error-ed on the side of caution and got one that was way higher than I thought that I needed.  At this point, I am happy with the device, it does what it says which you can't ask for more!  The light is handy when plugging in devices in the dark (which works very well for me as I work at night).  The only weak point that I see that is also a pro is the interchangeable heads to charge multiple devices.  I feel like there should be a different way to secure the head into the cord other than using friction to hold it in place.  Other than that, I am really happy with this product and I would recommend it!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005K7192G" id="B005K7192G-review179" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-04:</strong> This battery could approximately provide 2 recharges for my Nexus 4, and currently no problems encountered.

If you want a set of headphones that you can use everyday that sound way better than a set of earbuds get these.I don't usually bother with doing these reviews, but I'd like people to know how good these are, especially for the price.By the way I bought 2...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008CJBGPE" id="B008CJBGPE-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-07:</strong> I have no issues, my son says he can hear great with them, being that he uses them for his nintendo 3Ds.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008CJBGPE" id="B008CJBGPE-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-29:</strong> very good quality liked the build of the headphones but sound was a little off. still gets the job done and works when watching movies</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008CJBGPE" id="B008CJBGPE-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-09:</strong> These  broke after only 2 weeks of receiving for Christmas.

For $5 you get what you pay for but that's not always a bad thing.  Yes, these headphones are cheaply made and "thin" but they sound pretty good and they are impeccable during my workouts, which is primarily why I bought them.PROS:Can't beat the price.Ships fast; ordered them on the 5th and I had them in my mailbox on the 9th.Incredible sound with deep bass. If you have an equalizer app on your phone, you can adjust the bass and treble to suit your taste.Snug fit and very comfortable around the ears; hardly any slippage when leaning forward.Very appealing and misleading (I've been asked by several people if I am wearing Beats).CONS:No noise-canceling capabilities, which sucks when I am on the loud train or in the gym.Sometimes the bass can be overwhelming.Can't use the headphones to talk.Overall, I am very pleased with the product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008CJBGPE" id="B008CJBGPE-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-12:</strong> Sound sucks</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008CJBGPE" id="B008CJBGPE-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-02:</strong> I read some glowing reviews.

The sound on them are awesome. I've owned some cheap varies ones (in this price range) and still was not impressed with the quality. These do not disappoint in that arena. What I did or do have a problem with is the input cable. Mine stopped working about a week into use. I've only had them for roughly 2-3 weeks. They do get everyday use or every other day use. But after they broke within the week, I haven't been able to use them. Its been a mother* bleeper to find a cord to fit these. Other than that, they are awesome.One thing before I finish this. When I got them they are folded like the top right hand picture. I had to put the cable into the jacks and then connect it to my MP3 (standard stuff.) BUT, because you know we love a good but. I went for 2 freaking days with them folded up on my head. Now let me tell you, I'm obviously not the smartest tool in the shed. But I think that an instruction manual for Dummies, like me. Would be beneficial, for that fact alone.To wrap it up, the packaging was just in a oversize plastic envelope, with no padding. (May vary by who you purchase them from IE-seller.) I'm surprised they didn't break. The plastic that snaps the headphones into position is also very cheap and feels like you are going to snap it in half. Be careful if you plan on folding these. It might be more convenient on storage but I don't think they could handle multiple use of it.  They fit snugly on my dumbo ears. It does take my ears a couple of minutes to endure the pain until they conform to having them on. Has sizing to go taller or shorter for a kid. Stretch is iffy, so big heads beware. (No offense, my husband cannot wear these, he has an Adam Sandler big egg shaped head.) Cushion on the top make it comfortable as long as you don't have any funky hair do, as well as the ones around the ears.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008CJBGPE" id="B008CJBGPE-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-14:</strong> The sound isn't anything to jump over, and the plastic snaps when bent even slightly over its limit.

The screen protector is crystal clear and easy to put on. The case is a pretty tough and feels good in my hands ... not to bulky  and fits in my pocket without getting hung up thanks to the hard plastic body. The rubber headphone plug is good and snug when used to keep out anything but earpiece. The bottom cover is a little odd but works none the less at protecting the data and HDMI plugs. Looks pretty well thought out and should defend a bit against water spilling except around the speaker area. Tossed it around with my Evo in it to see how well it took shock... It's still going lol!!! All in all it's a great case and I would recommend it to other Evo 4G users.Would like to see a bit of a rubber coating on the plastic part and that would make it great for those dashboard placers.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0043GWE1A" id="B0043GWE1A-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-25:</strong> I love this case.

After trying 2 screen protectors this is the first one that actually worked and was the easiest to put on.  The case offers protection and is well formed to the phone.  I was worried about reviews on the bottom flap but come on, take your time taking it in and out and you should have no problems.  Great price for the product, cheapest I found in retail was $25 at SAMS.  Only issue is I did not like the packaging, was not original BOX, just items sealed in a baggy which makes me wonder if this was truly "New" but that is my nature.

I has served its purpose well, especially since I just dropped the phone on the pavement yesterday and there isn't even a mark on it.Pros: The case fits perfectly, lining up the openings with the kick stand, rear speaker, rear camera, and flash. it has a tough plastic outer shell with a silicon interior for shock absorption which, as I mentioned, I accidentally put to the test with positive results. It also comes with a screen protector. The case is raised a bit above the screen so if you drop it on the screen side, the raised silicon and plastic will keep the screen from making contact with whatever you dropped it on (unless there is a rock or something sticking up).Cons: The only con I found is that there is no belt clip. For me, I didn't care, I would not clip this phone to my belt anyway, I bump into things way too often. If you are looking for a belt clip, then this is not for you.Summary: All in all, this is a high quality case and one of the best I have used on a smartphone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0043GWE1A" id="B0043GWE1A-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-11-20:</strong> I just got this case a few days ago and was initially disappointed. Apparently I didn't have the case installed properly because once I re-installed it the fit is much better. I installed by inserting the phone towards the bottom of the case, then the left side, lastly I secured the volume rocker side and it fits much better. The rubber still attracts lint and hair but I can live with that I guess. I cut off the headphone and port 'flaps' to avoid them coming undone as I found them to be annoying and not needed. The case is still slippery on the back but I'm hoping it provides good protection as it seems it will. I posted a picture of the case without the port covers if anyone is curious to see what it looks like without them before cutting off their own. I will update after more usage.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0043GWE1A" id="B0043GWE1A-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-13:</strong> I purchased this product to safeguard might evo. When I received the product I was very disappointed in the quality of the case. After about three months of use one quarter of the hard part of the case broke. The hardshell is very flimsy and obviously is very easy to break. The rubber part of the case was not adequate in my opinion to really safeguard the phone. I would definitely look for other cases.

Reading reviews, the OtterBox Commuter series seemed to be the best balance of quality versus price, and I priced them at our local brick & mortar stores.  Local prices were nearly double that of Amazon's, making the wait for the case to be delivered worthwhile too.  Amazon's delivery, even during the busy Christmas season, was amazing with the "free super shipping".  I had the case delivered in 4 days!  (Of course, it does help when UPS/FedEx is on the ball too.)It arrived today, and my husband was sure that it wasn't going to fit right.  It was a breeze to get the screen cover in place and the case onto the phone.  Unlike the phone itself, it also offers protective flaps in the silicone portion for the various holes for inserting things.  The cut outs fit perfectly too.  I love the outer cover--it will keep the silicone portion from attracting every bit of lint & crud possible, as well as presenting a comfortable grasp for picking up and holding the phone.  It's also attractively business-like and not too bulky.The included screen cover definitely makes this a wise purchase--local prices for this alone were over half of Amazon's price for the case & screen cover.I may not be sure about how much I like the HTC EVO 4g yet, but the OtterBox Commuter case is an immediate hit! I definitely recommend this case--you won't be sorry if you get it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0043GWE1A" id="B0043GWE1A-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-25:</strong> I really like the otter box brand and this case is good for the first month about.

My sister-in-law has the Defender series on her iPhone 4 and iPad. I'd never heard of Otterbox cases before. It's a two part case: first you put on the flexible silicone glove and then the hard polycarbonate shell. It's very easy to put the two together and once you get them on - you know your phone is protected. It does not add bulk or weight to the phone. In fact it feels very nice in your hand - very sturdy and something you can easily grip. This case is advertised to protect your phone from bumps basically - unlike the Defender series which apparently you can drive over and still not break it. However the Defender case is bulky and I didn't want that. The Commuter series is perfect for me and I'm sure if I dropped it my phone would survive - even if it landed on the screen side. The case has a raised edge around the front of the phone, so if you were to lay it down on it's face, it would not be touching anything. As for attracting dust - mine has yet to. This case also comes with a basic screen protector. Nothing fancy, just a basica protector which is nice if you don't have one. If you are wanting more protection I suggest the BoxWave HTC Incredible ClearTouch Anti-Glare Screen Protector (Single Pack) ,SGP STEINHEIL HTC Evo 4G Sprint Screen Protector (Anti Fingerprint)orZAGG invisibleSHIELD for HTC Evo 4G (Screen)for maximum protection. I highly recommend this case!! Protect your EVO with the best!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0043GWE1A" id="B0043GWE1A-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-09-16:</strong> I previously had a Seidio Innocase II and it developed a crack so I ordered this case since Seidio wouldn't warranty their crap for more than a month or so.  Anyway, back to the Otterbox Commuter for the HTC EVO.  If the hard plastic part of this case had a rubberized finish it would be a very good case but, it doesn't and this hard plastic is slick and hard to keep a solid grip on.  The silicone inner case is exposed on the top and bottom and it has plenty of grip and makes it hard to get out of your pocket.  So the darn case is hard to hold and hard to get in and out of your pocket at the same time.  I much prefer the rubberized finish of the Seidio but, their warranty sucks and I have heard Otterbox is great about any warranty problems.  Also, the silicone flap that covers the charging jack and HDMI jack is constantly coming undone when you slide it in and out of your shirt pocket or any other pocket so you are constantly having to readjust that flap so that it will again cover the jacks.  I really like how the inner silicone part of this case has the raised volume and power buttons but, at this point I am shopping for another case.  Note:  The holster that came with my Seidio Innocase II will also work with this case.  I much prefer the holster of the Seidio over the Otterbox Defender holsters.  The Seidio is actually spring loaded and the Otterbox relies on flexing plastic to keep your phone secure.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0043GWE1A" id="B0043GWE1A-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-12-26:</strong> OK, the whole reason for me buying a case is to protect the lens on the rear camera that HTC decided to make stick out instead of recessing into the case like every other camera on a mobile phone has ever done. So camera protection was my main focus. And this case does the job , hands down.However, the silicone component involved is extremely thin and cheap. After reading all of the reviews I just assumed everyone was being whinny as per usual.But I have to say it is the only disappointing piece of this product. I figured that since OtterBox was pretty highly spoken of, especially when protection was a concern, that all of its components would be heavy duty. Not this paper thin silicone sleeve that just feels flimsy and cheap. Now the outer shell is fantastic, and I LOVE the way it recesses the camera to give it the best protection. Over-all, I am pleased with this case. But it doesn't live up to the hype I have heard about OtterBox. If it wasn't for the way the camera is protected by the plastic shell I would have passed this product right on by.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0043GWE1A" id="B0043GWE1A-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-26:</strong> This case it amazing!

I was a bit concerned that it would be too bulky, but those concerns were unfounded.  Its sleek profile fits my phone perfectly and it slides in and out of my pocket easily; my previous phone case was silicone and I finally threw it away because it would get hung up inside my pocket and I would miss calls.  The inner case is silicone and gives extra protection in the event you drop the phone--I have not experienced any of the problems of it attracting lint and dirt that I read from a few other reviewers.  I have dropped my phone a couple of times since I have had this case and it has protected it well.  I LOVE the screen protector that came with the case; it is not like other worthless screen protectors I have tried.  The only complaint I have is the silicone piece that protects the charger inlet does not function well and became a hassle.  Like other reviewers, I simply cut it off.  It does not affect the way the case protects the phone.  I highly recommend this case, and I will definitely check out other OtterBox cases for any future phones I  purchase.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0043GWE1A" id="B0043GWE1A-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-11-28:</strong> I've had the EVO since it's release and this is the 3rd case I've owned.  Compared to the last two cases (Body Glove hard case and Seidio Innocase) this is by far the best one yet.  I've owned OtterBox brand cases in the past and loved the protection offered.  The Commuter series is a great way to have protection similar to the Defender series (rubber & hard layers), without all the bulk.  Installing the case and included screen protector is fairly simple.  As with any non-liquid screen protectors, make sure the screen is COMPLETELY free of dust and debris.  Otherwise, you'll have indefinite air-bubbles.  Once the protector is on, then comes the silicone based inner shell.  It forms to the phone pretty well, but I kinda wish it was a BIT more snug in areas where material is thinner.  Once that's on, the outer shell is added.  I found it a bit tricky to put on mainly due to the thin rubber on the left and right sides of the inner shell and the USB/HDMI protective flap.  Once the case is on, it feels quite solid.The reason I didn't give this 5 stars is due to a few things.-If I have to pull the battery out or change the SD card, the whole case has to come off.  One thing I liked about the Seidio case was the case came off quickly.-The protective flap for the USB and HDMI ports pops out all the time.  Usually when the phone is pulled out of a pocket.  If there was a "plug" similar to the HPJ protective flap, then this would probably reduce the likeliness of this occurring.-The inner silicone shell could be a bit more snug.  When I'm taking off or putting on the outer hard shell, I feel like I'm going to tear the thinner areas of the inner shell.-The Kickstand.  With the Body Glove and Seidio case, it was pretty easy to open the kickstand.  Much more difficult with this case.  Also the phone is much more unstable with the kickstand open on it's side.  I feel like any slight movement will cause the phone to fall over when I'm watching a movie or reading a book.Overall though, I'm quite happy with this case :)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0043GWE1A" id="B0043GWE1A-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-03-04:</strong> The quality of the case is up to typical Otterbox standards, that is to say it is well made and fits the phone very well. I love Otterbox cases, but this one has some serious design flaws. If you carry in your pocket, the rubber plugs keep pulling out every time you pull the phone out. But if you carry in a snap-in holster (like the Seidio one), the floppy rubber top edge catches on the clip and you have to use two hands to put it in the holster. So neither carry option is good with this case.For pocket carriers, I would recommend looking to a different case, OR cutting the plugs off this case.For holster carriers, I recommend the Seidio case/holster combo. I ended up purchasing it and it works very well. The Seidio case is also smooth enough that it can slip into a pocket for occasional pocket carry.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0043GWE1A" id="B0043GWE1A-review26" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-09-28:</strong> This is a great replacement for my Body Glove case.  The rubber covers over the headphone jack and the charging socket are a bit annoying, but other than that, this is very nice.  It's a soft rubber inner layer with a hard shell outer layer.

The case has performed well so far, but the plastic screen protector isn't the highest quality.The screen protector scuffed in several places within a few days of use and as a result sometimes creates errors when using the touch screen. I used my phone for 3 months without a screen protector and never had any issues with scratches or scuffing, and this protector scuffed within a week. That said, the screen protector did it's job and the screen has not been damaged - just the screen protector. I will find another brand to use for the replacement screen protector.As for the case itself, it works well. I've dropped my phone once or twice and it is no worse for wear. It fits snugly and isn't too bulky, so you can still carry your phone in your pocket without it being too cumbersome. My only complaint is the rubber inner case doesn't fit well and is beginning to stretch out, as are the flaps which cover the connection points. I've only had the case for a month, so that seems to be a little quick for it to begin showing a lot of wear (especially since I work from home and don't abuse my phones).Overall this is a nice case and works as advertised, but it's not quite 5 stars in my book.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0043GWE1A" id="B0043GWE1A-review36" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-06:</strong> its an otter box, just not the whole solid type otter box, it consists of a rubber sleeve that goes around the phone and then a Hard plastic backing that slips over the rubber.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0043GWE1A" id="B0043GWE1A-review37" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-24:</strong> I bought the OtterBox Commuter-Series Case for HTC EVO.

I decided to try this one out and I am not disappointed.The fit for my arm is great.  It has two slots to accommodate what I would call &#34;small&#34; and &#34;medium&#34; bicep sizes.  So far the velcro strap has been good.  We'll see how it behaves over extended wear.The pros:+ fits the phone with a case (I use a slim case)+ full enclosure of the device; the top has a sort of cover, so I can see how this could be rain-resistant if you went out for a run in the wet+ as above, the two arm sizes will accommodate most people+ navigation through the plastic screen is not obstructedThe only cons I would list:- no access to power button- no access to volume rocker- (not the fault of this armband) as a result of the size of the smartphone, the whole unit is HUGE when wearing around the gym, so it may get in the way of certain movementsAnyhow, these cons could be remedied with a cut out on the corresponding sides of phone enclosure; though I'd rather not do so myself!

I have one for my iPhone 5 and love it. This is essentially the same case for the Nexus5, and it lives up to my expectations. The actual case portion (that holds the phone) is sturdy but VERY thin. (WARNING, it does not protect the screen at all, so falls with the flap open might not end well). The leather feels fantastic inside and out, and the stitching is durable and looks nice. The magnet is strong and holds the cover closed with no problems.BUT. The Nexus 5 has a wireless charging feature, and this case is not compatible with it. I tried several different positions and orientations for the case over the stock google wireless charger, and it just won't connect. This is a huge bummer, and I will have to see over the next few days if I want to return the case.Otherwise this is a 5-star case!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00G6AOCTS" id="B00G6AOCTS-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-14:</strong> It's decent quality. Like others have said once it's in this you can't control the volume, which stinks. It's also a royal pain to get the phone out of the case once it's in. The other issue I run into with this is I use this on my forearm while lifting weights and while I'm not super skinny even with the Velcro as tight as it can go the band will sometimes fall off my arm.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00G6AOCTS" id="B00G6AOCTS-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-30:</strong> The armband works fine, keeping your phone on your arm while working out, but the pouch is very tight, and it is difficult to get the phone inside the pocket if you have any kind of casing on the phone. Once inside the pouch, operating the volume and the on/off buttons is difficult because of the distance from the side of the pouch to the phone. Otherwise, the thing does what it is supposed to do, and it can fit anything from the skinniest arm to a fairly big bicep.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00G6AOCTS" id="B00G6AOCTS-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-01:</strong> I love this little phone wallet.

It holds maybe 4 cards well, and does have a small pocket underneath the card slots for cash.  I wouldn't recommend putting more than a few bills in there, and you still may have to try some origami to fold them up right to prevent the wallet from getting bulky when you close it.  The only thing I would change on it would be to have more of a magnetic-close clasp rather than a strap and loop, but that's a pretty minor thing that I'm more than willing to live with.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00G6AOCTS', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00G6AOCTS', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00JGWTR1Q</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00JGWTR1Q</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

I also used it to charge myHTC One V Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile)with the included micro USB cord.Despite being listed as a product this item charges, my iPad mini's cord was not included.  The mini was quickly charged by this battery (as was the unlisted iPod touch 5th generation), but my own cord was needed. There is no includedApple Lightning to USB Cableincluded with this external battery charger.In addition to those devices which I own and tested with it, the battery can also charge Android tablets and multiple brands of smartphones; per the link description.What I liked about this product:1. It works!2. It's very quick to charge smaller devices like iPhones and smartphones.  Three devices: iPhone 4S, iPad mini, and HTC One V smartphone all charged before starting on the iPad 3, with over half the battery still charged.3. Despite being lower capacity than their other similar products, it worked very well and on multiple devices prior to needing to be recharged.4. It's not much bigger than my iPhone, making it easy to carry with me in my purse, backpack or pocket.5. You can charge (2) products at the same time with the (2) USB 2.0 ports.6. Recharging the battery was quick via my PC's USB port.7. Highly portable.8. Battery seems well made and did not heat up at all during charging or discharging.What I didn't like or would like to see improved upon:1. The directions that come with the product were written by non-native English speaking writers. Some of the directions were confusing because of this, and some points were lost in translation.2. A lightining cable connector should be included with this battery if it is designed to charge i-devices using it like the iPhone 5, iPad mini and iPod touch 5th generation.  Undoubtedly this will be the new Apple standard and adding that connector would be a great addition to this product.3. It is recommended in the directions that you NOT use the USB port on your PC to charge it, but instead use a micro USB charger which is not included (per the instructions). "What?" This again goes to the poor directions.  There is a micro USB cord (used for smartphones and tablets) that fits into the side of the battery where it says 'IN'.  This connects to your PC's USB port and that's the only way to charge it.4. There's NO AC plug-in for this battery to charge it.  You must charge it via a USB port on a laptop or PC.5. No USB 3.0 port on this battery.6. I Included carrying pouch did not fit the item. The pouch was too small.Overall, this is a very good external battery charger for iPhones, iPods and smartphones.  It's OK for tablets and iPads, but will take longer to charge those devices.  It also works well with the iPad mini andApple iPod touch 16GB Black/Silver (5th Generation) NEWEST MODEL, but you must use your own lightning cable as it's not included with this device.I like that I was able to quickly charge the battery and then fully charge my iPhone 4S, iPad mini, HTC One V smartphone and still had 50% of the battery left to charge my iPad 3rd generation.It was super to be able to charge (2) devices at once, and so quickly. This product will be a great item to throw in my bag when I travel, especially for my phones.NOTE: I was contacted by a representative of EasyAcc to review this product. I did not purchase it myself, nor did I receive any payment for this review.7/26/13: UPDATEWe had a power outage today and my iPhone battery was low.  I hooked it up to this external battery and it charged fully in 30 minutes. I then topped off the battery in my iPad 3 which had been on 60%, and fully charged an iPod Touch 1st Gen that I keep in my purse for hooking up to the car stereo.  The battery STILL had juice!I'm more and more impressed with this product and increased the review to 5 stars.  It works well, stays cool, simple to use, and works as intended.I also like that as the battery is depleted, I see the 4 blue (illuminated) bars go down to show battery capacity.  The lighted bars are only on briefly when turning on the device and when connected to the item being charged (as it's charging).8/21/13; UPDATEI continue to love this product!  I now carry it with me either in my car or in my purse for a quick charge of my iPhone 4S.  The battery blinks its blue lights to indicate the iPhone is fully charged and shuts itself off, not continuing to deplete the battery.  I'm getting 4-5 full charges off one fully charged battery, and the charges are very quick!Very impressed with this product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006FRD8QU" id="B006FRD8QU-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-17:</strong> For the price it's an amazing purchase.

In fact, I'd never heard of it.  Not having a recognizable brand name shouldn't be a deterrent, but it's working with the unknown that sometimes makes me shy away from trying anything new.  I was very pleasantly surprised with the performance and the fact that the battery pack came with a 30-pin cable for the iPad.  I'm always worried I'll lose mine and receiving another was an unexpected bonus.When I go anywhere I like to take along a battery pack just in case there are what I call plug hogs around (inevitable) or the power goes out.  Carrying along a battery pack is just a bit of extra insurance I like to have.  This 10000mAh battery pack can charge up two devices at once, but I always prefer to see how they can perform when charging up an iPad.  If a battery pack can charge an iPad, no doubt it can charge small devices or things like an iPhone or smartphone.  The EasyAcc performed marvelously and actually, better than I expected it to.  It is a minimalist-like product and only came with two additional cords.  Perfect for someone who doesn't want a lot of extras they don't need.EasyAcc Performance:Start: 58% (4 LEDs)~ 30 minutes .... 70% (4 LEDs)~ 60 minutes .... 88%%~ 90 minutes .... 92%  (3 LEDs)~ 120 minutes .... 97%~ 135 minutes ... 100%LED INDICATORS:1 LED - 5% - 25% charge remaining2 LEDs - 25% - 50%% charge remaining3 LEDs - 50% - 75% charge remaining4 LEDs - 75% - 100% charge remainingAlthough my iPad was not seriously depleted and was 58% charged when I started, it still had a way to go to be fully charged.  Mind you, I didn't sit on it watching it every second as it charged, but was quite surprised at how rapidly this 10000mAh was able to power it up without dumping its own charge at a rapid pace.  At just under 3" x 5 1/3" it's slightly larger than many battery packs, but is quite sleek and easy to hold in my hand.  The edges are tapered and the price, not unlike similar battery packs is quite reasonable.  The most pleasant surprise was receiving a full 30-pin cable for the iPad as opposed to simply receiving a connector.  This is a new battery pack on the market that's definitely worth taking a look at.SPECS:~ Capacity: 10000mAh~ Output:USB I: 5V / 2.1AUSB 2: 5V / 1A~ Weight: 260g (.57 pound)~  Input charging time:  7 - 10 hours~ Life Cycle: >500 Times~ Charging Time: 8 -11 hours~ Input Charging Rate: 1000mA / hour~ Output Charging Rate: 2100mA / hourWHAT'S IN THE BOX:~ 1 EasyAcc External Battery~ 1 30-pin Apple cable~ 1 Micro USB power cable~ 1 Silk-like travel pouch~ 1 Quick start guideSample provided for review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006FRD8QU" id="B006FRD8QU-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-12:</strong> I have used this to charge my phone twice now and it works flawlessly. It's small and slides easily in a pocket (I leave it in my computer bag which I always have with me during the day).  When I know I am going to be somewhere I can't charge, I use it to keep my phone going until I can plug into a proper power charger.  The size is approximately 4"L x 2.5"H x .25"W (4 inches long, by 2 and a half inches wide, thickness is about one quarter inch).  There is a convenient blue light array on the top surface letting you know how much charge remains on the unit (four for full power, three for 3/4 power, etc.)It does not provide a quick charge.  It takes about an hour to charge my Samsung Galaxy S3 and will only charge it once, before needing to be self-charged again.  Again, this unit is a lifesaver.  Normally, I had to "go dark" and let my phone die.  With this, it keeps it going until I can get to the next full charge.Note that the EasyAcc 3000mAh Portable Slim External Battery Pack Charger does NOT come with it's own charging cord - so you'll need one to charge this unit (any "Micro USB" charger will do).  The little cord you see in the picture is the cord that plugs into YOUR PHONE when you want to charge it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006FRD8QU" id="B006FRD8QU-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-30:</strong> I received this battery pack today 5/30/13, and i really like it, especially compared to some of EasyAccs other batteries. This one, much like on mophie battery packs, and the nexus 4, has soft touch around the side, which is either in silver, or orange, depending on which you choose. The yellow, is more like a creamsicle color, just be aware of that when ordering. It arrived fully charged and with a micro-USB cord, as well as an apple 30 pin cord. Generic lightning cables for the iphone 5, ipad mini can be had on amazon for about $2 with free shipping. This battery pack does seem a little large for 10,000mAh, compared to the anker astro 3e and the ravpower 10400mAh dynamo on the go. That being said, it is entirely possible that this has more capacity than 10000mAh and i will test its charging capabilities, here they are.4 lights on- charge ipad mini (4400mah) from 7% to 100%, 2 lights are left.2 lights on, nexus 4 (2100mah) from 28% to 100%2  light on nexus 4 from 34% to 100% 1 light left.1 light on nexus 4 from 32% to 67% and it is dead.The total charge used by these devices was the following4092mah for the iPad mini1512mah for 1st nexus charge1386mah for second nexus charge735mah for third nexus chargeTotal charge = 7725mAh= 77.2% efficiency which is pretty good, considering about 20% of energy is lost in voltage conversion.These devices were charged while on so actual capacity may be about 5-600mAh larger.DISCLAIMER- I received this product in exchange for an HONEST review from the manufacturer.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006FRD8QU" id="B006FRD8QU-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-02:</strong> Ive been looking for an external charger to give me peace of mind in case I'm away from the power outlet. I use my phone heavily, play ingress (which requires a constant gps connection), navigation, bluetooth to stream pandora to my car, constant 4g connectivity, gaming, push emails/social network notifications, video watching, gaming, and of course texting. As you can probably tell, i dont really use my phone for calling anymore! Anyways, I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 which already has a large 3100mAh battery, which can get me through the day if i dont use my phone very heavily or if im connected to a wifi network. However, when i spend all day at college, go on roadtrips, or travel, I definitely need more power! with this easy acc external battery charger i have no worries that my phone will die on me within a day.PRO:-It is still Pocketable!! it fits in my front pockets and back pockets just fine. I am a guy, and i wear slim fitted jeans and have no problems. However, women will most likely have to keep this in a purse.-you can charge 2 devices at a time! it has 2 Charging slots. one rated at 2A and one rated at 1A-I like the silver accent around the side of the device.-Comes with a micro usb cable as well as the standard apple connector. (Note: it isnt the new lightning connector)CON:-It is definitely heavier than my note 2. This shouldnt come as a huge surprise because it is a large battery.-Again, this shouldnt come as a surprise, but the charger does take time to charge using the 2A charger that came with my Note 2.-If the output exceeds 3.1A, then this external charger will automatically shut off to protect itself.As you could tell, 2/3 Cons aren't really cons, but just points to note when carrying around any large battery. it will be heavy and it will take some time to charge it.For those of you wondering about the size of this item, its about the size of my Galaxy note 2 dimension wise.Hope this review helps!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006FRD8QU" id="B006FRD8QU-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-30:</strong> I bought this for playing Ingress with and it has not let me down!

So if I'm out and about, I always have to make sure I have it fully charged. And airports? I have to find a power plug and those are at a premium these days.So to find a compact power bank that not only charges my phone and Kindle but also my tablet, is a huge plus. The EasyAcc is a nice, sleek design. It has two USB ports to charge two devices at a time. It comes with two USB cables, one micro USB and one 30-pin iPad cable. Or you can always use your own USB cables.What surprised me is that although both ports are 5V, only the second port charges my tablet. But I'm happy anyway. Other devices charge with speed and the battery holds a good amount of power.A nice middle range unit good for a travel bag or briefcase but maybe a little big for a pocketbook.I was provided a unit for evaluation and an honest review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006FRD8QU" id="B006FRD8QU-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-18:</strong> I ordered  this to replace one which did not charge my iPad.

I can charge it up and 2 weeks later its still fully charged.Pros: Holds a charge really well.Charges several devices on a single chargeCan charge 2 devices at once.Uses the common micro-usb cableCons: A little bulkyTakes a while to charge</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006FRD8QU" id="B006FRD8QU-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-08:</strong> EasyAcc makes two 10000mAh Power Banks that are the essence of power and convenience. First the battery pack is about one-half a pound (8 ounces) and measures (3/4" X 3" X 5-1/2"). The button on the side shows you how much battery life you have with four bright blue LED lights. Each one represents 25% battery life. My battery came fully charged, but when empty, will take from seven to ten hours to fully charge.It's a good idea to let your battery go down to about 10%-15%, but no lower. This keeps the battery life lasting and it already claims to recharge over 500 times! You charge through a micro USB port to a regular USB that can be charge through your computer or through a wall outlet if you use an Apple adapter type device. I found this to be a faster charge.There are also two included cables. One is for charging from your Power Bank to your Apple device (30-pin insert) and a micro USB which is also the cable you use for charging. That's it. Two cables to do all of that instead of an entire package of misfit accessories.There are two out USB ports on the top side. It's nice to have the voltage capability easily readable. One USB output is 5V-1A and the other is a 5V-2A. The 5V-2A is for charging larger devices like your iPad, Tablet, etc. And the other USB port is for charging just about anything else. The difference is significant in charging time.The instructions (and the top of the Amazon page) show you what devices can be charged. It's virtually unlimited. Just some geek info: "mAh" means `Milli-ampere hour'. It's the rating of the battery. It means your battery is of a 10000 mAh rating.I have an iPhone 4S and it will charge five full times easily. It charged my iPad mini and my iPhone 4S together in about (8.0) hours from a starting point of 15% full. I would suggest charging one device at a time to be sure of a full charge in a faster time. If overnight, use them both.The battery is a very high quality "Li-Polymer". Some great features you need to know are that there is an extensive security system set up. You can never over-charging, over-current, over-discharge or have short circuit when using this Power Bank properly. This is a Power Bank/Battery at the top of its game.

Now I have reduced it to 1, because after one use, it will not charge.  I plugged it into the solar charger that is pimped with it, and it would not charge.  The indicator light blinks, but it will not charge at all.  I then plugged it in using the mini USB charger I used when I first received it.  Did the same thing.  Light blinks, but no charge.  Tried another mini USB charger, same result.  Now, I'm very disturbed that Amazon won't take it back because I've had it longer than 30 days, so now I have to deal with a company that operates out of China.  I just had to write them (EasyAcc) on their website, and I am waiting for their reply. I wanted to have battery backup for a camping trip this weekend.  Now I have to go without.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!ORIGINAL REVIEW: I charged this when I first got it 2.5 months ago.  It has been sitting in it's case, that I bought along with it and the solar charger, ever since.I decided to finally pull it out and see what I could get out of it.  I turned it on, and all 4 four bars lit up, showing it was still charge enough to show 4 bars.  I first plugged my powered off Kindle Fire HD 7 inch to it.  My Kindle was down to 7%, and fully charged to 100% after about 5 hours.  The EasyAcc was down to 2 bars of power left in it.  The Kindle battery is approximately 4000mAh, so if the EasyAcc used around 5000mAh to charge it, that's seem pretty good to me.Next I plugged my HTC One S, which is 1650mAh.  Note:  I was down to 10% and charged it while the phone was still powered on. It took a couple hours to charge back to 100%, with the phone on.  The EasyAcc was down to 1 power bar lit.Two days later, I plugged my phone into it again, and charge it from 12% to 100%, while powered on.  Still 1 power bar lit on the EasyAcc.After 2 more days, I plugged my phone into it again at 7%, while power on.  After about 20 minutes, I noticed the last power bar left on the EasyAcc, was flashing, telling me that it was about to run out of power.  It finally shut down after getting my phone up to 28%.I'm not a techie, but I'd estimate that my phone battery charged for a total of 3300mAh, off the EasAcc that was down to approximately 5000mAh.  Also, remember my phone was also on, and I did unplug it a couple times to answer calls during the charging process, and then plugged it back in.  I'm thinking if I use it just for my HTC phone, I should be able to get between 5 and 6 charges out of it.I'm very happy with how my 10000mAh EasyAcc Power Bank Pack performed, especially after sitting for 2.5 months in between the first charge, and actually using it.  I will be hooking it up to the EasyAcc Solar Charger to see how well it charges so I can gauge how it will perform on my camping trips to charge my phone and camera batteries.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006FRD8QU" id="B006FRD8QU-review23" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-25:</strong> i have a samsung galaxy sii (s2) and am able to charge it fully from a near dead battery 4-6 times with this portable power case!  the lengthy reviews for this item with video reviews tell you everything else you need to know about this!  worked great for me over a period of a week at church camp in the woods without power!!

It can charge your smartphones about 5 to 6 times on a single charge. It includes a standard microUSB cable to charge the power bank from any wall outlet USB charger like the one that comes with your IOS devices or Kindles, or to your PC USB port, and a 30-pin USB cable for older Apple devices. I particularly like that it charges with a microUSB cable as I often misplace or mix up an AC adapter with other gadgets' adapters. I can use any microUSB charger in the house.It can charge two devices at once from it 2 USB ports provided the total doesn't exceed 3.2A. Life cycle is about 500 times.Cons:- although it will charge 2 devices at once, it will not charge two 2.1 devices at once. The charger gets overloaded and auto shut-off to prevent damage.Sample item provided by the distributor for evaluation review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006FRD8QU" id="B006FRD8QU-review26" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-29:</strong> This charger pack holds a full charge well and the price is great. capacity of 1000h/37WhInput 5V 1500mAOutput 5V 1000-2000 mANote you will need to either own an output 5.0V-2.0A (example what you use charge a nexus 7 or IPad but with a micro usb tip instead...)Or you can buy a charger on amazon for $10 free shipAlso the device will not come fully charged so make sure you fully charge it before use so that the battery registers a full max charge cap.The size of the charger is about the same size if you were to stack 4 or 5 regular sized Hershey bars with an additional rectangle chocolate piece added on to the width of the unit lol I'm eating chocolate as I'm writing this.Anyways I got this for only $27.99 if you bought two of these it would run you at half the price of a 20000mAh charger pack that is selling for $100 bucks on amazon and so far ive only seen one on the market that seems legit. So take this price 27.99 2 = 20000 mAh  for the price of about $56 can not be beat! Its a decent sized unit if you bought two of these but you have to consider today's technology and the power consumption. Anyways as of this reviews date this is the best deal I could find with a trusted brand in the amazon market (I'm sure better will come out in the future). EasyAcc is selling a charger that holds 12000 mAh for $40 (2000mAh more) and other brands sell 13500mAh to 15500mAh charger packs for $50-$70 etc. So you do the math :)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006FRD8QU" id="B006FRD8QU-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-22:</strong> size is as described, it's heavy as other reviewers have noted, but it's fine for my use.  Used it for charging various ipods, iphone, etc, during long bus rides & airflights.  Lights are handy as a charging indicator & what's left indicator.  Stays on while charging, auto turn off when done charging.  Based on other reviews & as described, I bought a 2.1mAh wall charger.  Came with cables as described.  Handy device, and good add-on to my carry on when flying or other travel.  Would be a much better item if it came with the EasyAcc customized bag pouch case which is sold/offered separately.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006FRD8QU" id="B006FRD8QU-review28" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-01:</strong> By way of disclosure, I received a complimentary copy of this unit for evaluation.  I rarely agree to review items I receive for free, but this was something I really needed for travel especially on my weekender boat.  This is quite a functional unit.  It is slightly larger in footprint than an iPhone 5.  It has LEDs to indicate its state of charge.  It recharged my dead iPhone 5 and had lots of juice left over.  The unit also shuts down when it is done charging your accessory, which is very nice.  It has two USB outputs, so this battery can power two devices at once.  I have iPhones, an iPad, and lots of photography gear that this unit will power and charge, so I will find lots of uses for it.  There is really nothing not to like here.  Construction, fit and finish all seem very solid.  Recommended.

This does work, but there are better choices.1. I have a more powerful Powergen 8400mAh battery pack that is much more compact than this unit, which is important to me because I keep it in my briefcase. Both units are about the same weight, but the Powergen dimensions are 3 3/4" x 2 1/4" x 3/4" versus 4 1/2 " x 2 3/4" x 1/2 " for this product.2. Like many power banks, the Powergen has a built in flashlight that I use all the time when I travel. This unit does not.Bottom line: This unit does work, but I prefer a more compact power bank and one that has a flashlight. Nonetheless I gave it four stars because the negatives for me may not concern other people, and this product does do what it says.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006FRD8QU" id="B006FRD8QU-review32" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-22:</strong> this has save me lots of time.i just charge everything from my backpack and not tethered to an outlet.i charged 4 phones in one day walking all over NYC.it works so well that my friends who's phone was being charged with it went out and ordered their own when we got back.thank you.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006FRD8QU" id="B006FRD8QU-review33" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-11:</strong> I have three power packs and they all feature a 4 bar LED display to indicate the level of power charge that they currently hold, this is no exception. It however only comes with two leads, one is the recharge lead with a USB and the other for I phones etc. So if you want to charge any other device you need to have your own cable which is not that big a deal. However it won't recharge from a computer so you need a separate charger which they say can be bought separately, luckily I already have one so no big deal for me, but may be an issue for some users.It needs to be fully charged before you use it and there is no information about how many times it will take and hold a charge as these are always degenerative. I have been using for a number of weeks now and it is fine, it takes longer to charge than a mains plug but that is to be expected with an output of around DC 5V/1.0A.Others have commented that the charge port is a bit tiny and needs to be correctly connected or it will not charge so do check, the LED lights come in to tell you how charged it is so not a big issue either. The User manual is very basic and pretty bad on the translation, it actually made me laugh and it is in English and German, but it gets the message across as at the end of the day it does actually work. You can get these with LED torches/flashlights too which are much better for festivals etc, but as a work a day power pack this is really very handy. I received a pack for review purposes. It is light weight, nice to look at easy to use and works, so I would give it the thumbs up - recommended.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006FRD8QU" id="B006FRD8QU-review34" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-08:</strong> I have been using this for nearly a year and I have nothing to complain. It works just as stated. It does't disappoint nor does it out perform. It can charge my iPhone 5 almost 4 times from 5% to 95%. The best part is it has two output ports so that your friend can charge his device while yours is plugged in.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B006FRD8QU', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B006FRD8QU', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li>
