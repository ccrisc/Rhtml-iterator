I came home and looked on Amazon and realized I coudl get a better case for cheaper. I ordered this case in clear and purple and a glitter case. I took back my Verizon one immediately and am so happy with my decision. Now, a few months later, I have ordered the pink and black, so I have a case for every mood.This case is awesome. It adds viritually no bulk to your phone, so you still get the sleek, thin feel of it. The side of the case have a grippy texture, making it easy to hold and feels good in your hand. The sides do not come over the front of the case much, but it is raised slightly, so offers some protection if your phone is dropped. It's thin, so it's not the most protective case out there, but I love it for keeping my phone nice and thin, I realize I can't have everything. They come on and off really easy, just takes a few seconds. For the price it's worth getting them in a few colors. Thie pink is cute on this one, looks just like the pictures.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0062V4KG6" id="B0062V4KG6-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-15:</strong> Pros-Very light weight-Non-bulky-Great Color-Raised edge around screen-minimal shock protection-great scratch protection-great grip-perfect cut-outs-easy to put on-just-right fitCons-No shock protection from flat-face fall</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0062V4KG6" id="B0062V4KG6-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-05:</strong> This case is durable, allows functionality of all buttons and ports, and is easy to remove/put on.

It is rather long and sticks out of the socket by almost an inch, it also lacks a light diode indicator. The end result is that the fit is not snug enough and there's not way to tell if it charging or not without looking at the phone, so I always have to double check to make sure it charges.

I had another usb charger that came up with my bluetooth device which was not working with my phone. This one does. They look exactly same, but it must have to do with proper wiring which this thing does. Hoping I can also charge my tablet with it if I ever order a usb charger for my iconia a500. I dont care about it as of now, so I will leave at it that. In all, a good product and hoping it satisfies my needs for a long time coming.

I've only had it a couple of days, but my favorite feature so far is displaying notifications.  It's very easy to just look at my wrist when I get a calendar notification which is proving to be quite handy if not essential. Camera works okay, it's fun to be able to have different watch faces, replies to texts are pretty useful. All in all, definitely fun if not essential.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JBJ3HHO" id="B00JBJ3HHO-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-06:</strong> I got it about 3 weeks ago and decided I was going to write my review after I had a while to learn it. First things first was my gear 2 was labeled as New, the security tags were off making it an Open Box (not a positive thing for Ideal Xpert), but I ignored that. The UI is pretty simple, was not difficult to pair with my Note 3 and made it easy to get some of the application notifications from my note 3 to the watch (ex: facebook, hangouts, CNN). My major issue is it is NOT waterproof, no matter what they say. I did the research before hand and saw people putting it in a tub of water for about 5 to 10 minutes, saw that there were no issues. So it being 111 degrees in Vegas, I went to the pool. Wore my Gear 2 with me, took a few pictures of my friend's dog splashing in the pool water then the screen turned off. Seeing that the battery had about 30% left anyway, I thought the battery was dead, so I plugged it in the charger. I left it alone to charge until it got to 100%, then turned on my Gear 2. The touch screen was not responding, and the date was stuck at December 31st and was stuck charging somehow. So I called amazon about it and thanks to not buying it from the amazon.com retailer, I could only get a refund not a exchange of the product (which was what I wanted originally, but now waiting for the moto 360) Amazon refused to help me contact the seller for an exchange, and insisted I would get a refund and go with them (adding the 8.1% tax to the cart). The supervisor was rude, not even willing to help, and had I probably contacted someone else on amazon's customer service, they would have been glad to help me.So instead of buying a smartwatch from amazon, I have decided to send it back, and wait until the release of the moto 360, not only is it cheaper, but seeing as Samsung actually failed on this smartwatch makes me not want to get a watch from them. I will stick with my note 3 and my note pro, but as far as a smartwatch, I am going to go with Motorola.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JBJ3HHO" id="B00JBJ3HHO-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-01:</strong> First off I've been using the Samsung Gear since last December.

Compared to that one and features of others I decided to finally shove my money at this one with all the features it has. At first I had a little buyers remorse...I just bought a 300 dollar watch just cause it added a camera feature that was 2mp! Hmm was that really smart. Well after getting it and downloading the samsung app I was pretty impressed with every feature of the watch, after tweeking some features in the app settings I was blown away by all it could do! Can make phone calls, text, add to schedule/calander, and more with out ever taking your phone out of your pocket! Now the 200 dolor one does that too, so is the camera/ 720 hd video feature worth the extra 100? After using it a ton I will say it was way worth it...it is by far the best 2mp camera I've ever used! My phone has a 2mp front camera and doesn't even come close to the quality the watch does! Even when cropping the quality is still there! Can even take pictures with a voice command!

Reading the reviews of the Samsung Gear Manager (which can only be seen within the Samsung App Store) I was worried about it not pairing, but it paired just fine for me on the first try.  Very nice screen, seems nice and customizable while still being locked down into only what they've provided (you sure don't have the 1000+ faces like pebble, but what they do give you is nice and functional and customizable.  Camera is fairly decent in good light.  Notifications so far are working well.It's pretty compact, and for its size it weighs a good amount without feeling heavy.  Not a huge fan of the strap, but it can be replaced.  As far as size, it's smaller than a larger Casio watch (the kind with a compass built in).  A little larger than a Pebble, but also clearly of higher quality.  Screen is nice and bright and the interface is simple and easy to get used to.  The charging cradle is nice too, it's tiny, very light weight and just snaps onto the back.  You plug into it with a standard micro-usb.I got mine at a Sprint store that happened to have them in stock.  Overall I'd say if you can afford it, you'll like it.  I can't attest to the health/fitness abilities of it, just not really my sort of thing.  I was looking for a watch with good notifications and functionality and I think this'll suit my needs.In my opinion, if you're undecided between this and the Neo on the basis of weight alone, go for this one, you won't notice the difference and the camera is nice to have for Evernote, translations, etc...If this watch was two hundred dollars it'd be a no-brainer.  For three hundred, it's a bit of a stretch, but there are worse ways to spend your hard-earned money.Update: Unplugged it from the charger this morning.  After looking at it quite a lot, 80+ email alerts, using s-voice to send a few texts and a factory reset (on purpose, swapped it to my new G5) it's at 88% battery life about 12 hours later.  Which I think is pretty good!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JBJ3HHO" id="B00JBJ3HHO-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-22:</strong> I received my new Gear 2 last Saturday morning via USPS, three days after ordering from a third party seller. I decided to order from a third party seller earlier in the week due to the fact that Amazon was still &#34;Temporarily out of stock&#34; on this item with no updates in over a week on when they'd get their stock and start shipping to customers. I had originally ordered from Amazon around a week prior and they still hadn't shipped or updated me at all, so I cancelled the order afterwards because I had no information on when Amazon would have the Gear 2 in stock. Being a Prime customer, it was upsetting that I had to &#34;resort&#34; to purchasing from a third party seller since usually shipping times are much longer. I expected better service and more specific communication from Amazon, especially since the demand for this product was so extensive. Luckily though, it seems that I made a lucky choice of third party seller to buy from because they shipped same-day and the product was packed safely and securely and arrived in about 3 days.Something important to note is that some sellers are currently selling the Gear 2 for around $320. People avoid these prices, believing they are overpriced, not realizing that Amazon applies sales tax in most states only for items purchased from Amazon directly,  which would have made the total cost rise to around $320 at checkout. In this case, there was pretty much no downside purchasing from a third party seller considering there was no estimate for when Amazon would receive their stock, so I decided to make my move and purchased from a seemingly reliable seller. It's also important to note that customers purchasing from third party sellers are exempt from sales tax if the customer resides outside of the seller's state. So, the Gear 2 was around the same price no matter where I purchased from.Anyways, after having used the Gear 2 for a few days, my thoughts and views are overall positive. Something I found odd was, being in the Computer Science field and having done extensive online research before purchasing, I quickly realized that my views and experience with the Gear 2 hardly matched what negative comments were being spread by the media in news articles, reviews, and opinions and commentaries throughout the past week. The media's stories focused on the belief that the Gear 2 added no benefit and didn't provide any increased functionality due to the fact that it didn't offer anything &#34;special&#34; and didn't provide any extra functionality that couldn't be found on a typical smartphone. Various news articles blatantly state that buying a Gear 2 was a huge waste money.I took these articles like a grain of salt. I saw the arguments mostly as opinions than anything else, I wanted to test it for myself and make up my own mind, and that's exactly what I did.At first use, it was really easy to notice the key benefit of the Gear 2, the fact that it's an incredible time saver. Smartphones are not very when you're on the go, because they aren't generally something you can just glance at without diverting your attention entirely towards it temporarily. If this is at work, smartphone use negatively affects your productivity. If this is while driving, smartphones are unsafe and illegal because they take attention completely off the road.For me, increase in time efficiency is the most important and obvious benefit offered by using the Gear 2. Unlike others, I don't care that the Gear 2 replicates smartphone functionality because of the aforementioned benefit. That doesn't make it any less of a useful device. What makes the Gear 2 useful is the fact that information that would have taken me 20 to 30 seconds to access on my smartphone can be accessed in just a couple seconds on the Gear 2 with a simple tilt of the wrist, swipe and tap. The Gear 2 clearly me saves time and effort, and it's shown me that it's an extremely handy device that has incredible potential.Anyways...enough of me defending the Gear 2, that's not the purpose of reviews.I've gotten in the habit of wearing the Gear 2 almost 24/7. I even keep it on while going to bed since it has so many uses. Just as a series of examples, right before bed, the Gear 2 allows me to: start tracking my sleep time, to set alarms for next morning just by speaking, check my appointments and calendar for tomorrow as well as the weather forecast, and replace the need to track down the TV remote control when I want to watch a late-night show right before bed.Looking back, I can see that the Gear 2 has helped keep me on track, focused, and organized since I started using it. You've got to push yourself to improve though, you can't expect improvement otherwise. However, the Gear 2 seems like a Swiss Army knife in the form of a tech gadget. There are just so many features and so much beneficial functionality included just via the default Samsung apps, and these apps completely fulfilled my expectations and personally justify the expense.Now, for the negative remark of my review, and as to why I took off a star.Although Samsung provides excellent built-in apps, I'm sure there is a huge potential for development of even better, more beneficial apps. The possibilities are endless for user-developed apps. Unfortunately however, the major downside right now is that user-submitted apps are pretty much non-existent in the Gear 2 market. The reason for this is that the Tizen OS, which the Gear 2 runs on, has still been left largely unembraced and unsurpassed by most mobile app devs. This whole situation is upsetting since the lack of apps for the Gear 2 takes away from the device's potential and its ability for users to customize the app to fit their needs most closely. I honestly didn't expect the app store to literally have less than total 15 apps in the entire market, none of which are really any good at all. That's not the quality that I expected from Samsung. It seems like Samsung dropped the ball by not succeeding in stimulating the early adoption of Tizen by developers.Although I feel the lack of apps is a mistake on Samsung's part that could maybe have been avoided by better planning, being knowledgeable about the Tizen situation I'm also sympathetic because it makes sense to me why there are almost no apps developed. The Gear 2 line of devices are essentially Samsung's first mainstream products to make use of their Tizen OS. Not many people have experience with how the OS works yet and people are just starting to become more acquainted with development for Tizen. In time, I don't have much doubt that developers will embrace Tizen, because where there's money to be made, they will come.However, as someone who purchased a Gear 2 so early on, it's unfortunate that people like me need to wait, who knows how long, in order for the atmosphere to improve for Tizen.Although it's not a deal breaker for me, for others who consider the current lack of user-made apps a much greater issue, I can see why they wouldn't be able to justify the expense until they start to see a community thriving around Gear 2 development.Some further negatives that I feel are noteworthy for prospective buyers:- The Gear 2 frame that covers the front face of the watch is aluminum, but the bottom half of the watch is actually a black plastic cover. Based on a description, I had expected that the entire watch exterior would be made of aluminum and I was disappointed when I saw the plastic bottom as it is more easily damaged.- The Gear 2 expects to be firmly and statically strapped to your wrist, otherwise while operating the touchscreen by swiping fingers, you'll make the watch perform loops around your wrist, which starts getting annoying pretty quickly.- The IR sensor's location being in the front-middle is slightly awkward to aim at the TV. It's something about having to tilt my wrist and tap on the screen with the other hand that just feels uncomfortable. It takes getting used to. In Samsung's defense I can't really think of a better place to put it to make it universally compatible with however a person enjoys wearing their watch. Same with the camera.- Flicking left and right can sometimes be noticeably laggy. I expected better performance from the 1.0ghz dual core processor/512MB RAM and didn't expect to see basic swiping animations lag so noticeably. I suppose I'm so used to my smartphone operating seamlessly without any slow-downs or lag, that I was not used to the slower animations on the Gear 2 hardware. Note that although there is noticeable lag, it barely impacts usability in any way at all.As a final note, nothing is ever 100% perfect, and there's always room for improvement.For the current state I'm very satisfied with the progress Samsung has made with its Gear smartwatch line of products. The Gear 2 is well worth the money and I highly recommend it due to its elegant aesthetics, faster hardware, and software which offers useful features with an easy to follow and very functional user interface.I'll continue to update my review if there's anything important to mention in the future that people should know, either positive or negative. Thanks for taking the time to read my thoughts, I welcome any questions or comments based on what I said.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JBJ3HHO" id="B00JBJ3HHO-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-05:</strong> I love the watch because I don't always want to be tied to my phone.

Let's get down to the nitty gritty:Pros:* Lovely screen. 320 x 320 resolution on a 1.63 inch display means 277 PPI, the highest resolution on a smartwatch so far. sAMOLED technology means it's very bright with great saturation and contrast.* Very fast and smooth. A dual-core 1GHz Samsung Exynos 3250 processor and 512MB of RAM means you can scroll and run apps without any lag. It has the fastest processor of any smartwatch so far.* Good fit. The face is not too big or clunky, so even with my tiny wrists it goes on and stays on fine. It only weighs 68g(2.4oz), so you will not notice it much. By comparison, the Neo weighs 55g, the original Pebble 38g, the Pebble Steel 56g, and the Sony SmartWatch 2 is a whopping 122.5g. As for the dimensions of the watch face: Sony - 42 x 41 x 9mm, Pebble Steel - 46 x 34 x 10.5mm, Pebble - 52 x 36 x 11.5mm, Gear 2 Neo - 43 x 37 x 9.5mm, Gear 2 - 47 x 37 x 9.5mm.* Good functionality. The main thing is you can use the watch for actual phone calls, not just a reminder to pick up your phone. Meaning there is a speaker and microphone on the watch for you to be Dick Tracy. I was going to buy the Sony Smartwatch 2, but found out it can't make/receive calls.-The watch has a heart rate monitor and pedometer built in, so you can use the S Health app on your phone to record and keep track of your heart rate, or how many steps you've taken that day or segment.-Another functionality that I like is I can control both my TV and cable box in one. I can control the power of both, change the volume of the TV, and change the channel of the cable box. I can also change the source input, and get info on the programming from the cable box. It has an IR blaster, and uses its own WatchON app. Pretty nifty.-There is also an email for you to check and delete your emails(but can't compose or reply), check and send text messages, check notifications from many apps on your phone, check the weather, has the Feedly app for health/fitness people.* 4GB of memory(2.9GB free) means you can store music and media to play. So not only can you stream the music from your phone, but you can also store them directly and play your videos and movies straight from the watch!* Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity to your Samsung phone, and also to your Bluetooth headset. It connected to my Note 3 right away and without any hiccups. And you can still connect and use your Bluetooth headset to make private calls if you don't want to use the watch's speaker.* Gorilla Glass 3 screen means it more scratch-resistant than other smartwatches. But why even risk it, just get a pack of screen protectors for $6.* Interchangeable straps - you can change the strap with any 22mm watch strap in the world. Awesome!* Apps from Banjo, BMW, CNN , Conde Nast, Expedia, eBay, Evernote, Feedly, Garmin, Glympse, GM , iControl, Line, Path, Paypal, Runtastic, Volkswagen, Weather Channel and Under Armour will come to the Gear 2 and Gear 2 Neo. Apps on the original Galaxy Gear will probably be ported over to the new version. Source: Pocket-Lint.com* IP67 dust and water-resistant. Don't take the ratings word for word though. In real-life, this ratings means: 1- you can wear it in the rain. 2- you can wear it while rinsing your hands. 3- You can wear it while exercising and have your sweat all over it. Basically, water can splash on it. But DON'T submerge it in water and expect it to 100%. This rating is about water pressure - it is SUPPOSED to last up to 3 feet in water. But if you submerge it and enough water pressure gets to it, it will malfunction. IT IS NOT WATERPROOF.Cons:* Call quality could be better. It isn't as good as on a phone, because it has to project the sound externally, the same as when you route your phone call to the external speaker. The volume could be louder, so using it outdoors or in a noisy environment is not ideal. It is mainly for when you are at home or in your car.* 2MP camera. Common, really? This is no more than a gimmick. First of all, it is really awkward to position it to take the photos in the first place. You can't hold it like you can a regular camera, or even your phone. You have to do it Dick Tracy style, which is not as cool as it sounds. It's really hard to see what you are shooting and to frame your shot right. And then when you see your photos..the quality is barely passable. Let's just say if you want to take photos, just use your phone. You might think it's really cool that's it's always there and you can just take a photo quicker and better than pulling out your phone. Maybe you're right, for when you see a UFO and you just have to shoot it as quickly as possible. Otherwise, USE YOUR PHONE.* I am a heavy gadget user. Although Samsung says the watch can last up to 6 days, for me constantly checking my notifications, using the WatchON app, fooling around with the watch, from 10am to 2am it went from 100% to 30%. Your battery usage will vary, and when I just use it to check my notifications when they pop up, make an occasional call with the watch itself, use it sometimes for the fitness and music apps, then it really does last about 3 days. I just wish it can really last a week as I know it might be a problem later, especially on my travels. Which brings me up to the next con:* The charger cradle is tiny and proprietary. It attaches to the back of the watch for when you want to charge it, and the included micro-USB charger connects to the cradle. It is a small piece of plastic which I fear will be far too easy to lose.* Finally, it can only connect to your Samsung phones(because of Tizen, and its proprietary connection method). The Pebble and Sony Smart Watch can connect to any Anroid, and the Pebble can connect to the iPhone too.Conclusion:This might be the biggest issue for me with this Galaxy Gear 2 line. So this is what happened: Samsung wanted to have a smartwatch before the end of 2013 to get a leg up on the competition. The success of the Pebble smartwatch told Samsung that it needs to be an innovator, not a follower. The launch date of the Note 3 was the perfect opportunity. However, at that time, the Android Wear platform/coding had not existed yet, so Samsung had to take the regular Android coding - which is NOT made for a smartwatch platform - and make all the changes on their own to fit with the original Galaxy Gear smartwatch. They quickly came to realized that is was a much harder task than they had thought, so what happened with the original Galaxy Gear was a rush job that although had a lot of potential, turn out to be something everyone hated. The most egregious shortcoming was that it would only last up to 3-4 hours, which is totally unacceptable. So in reality, version 2 was what the original Gear was supposed to be had Samsung not overestimated their skills, or had more time to develop the original Gear. But since they realized regular Android would not make a good platform for watches(the battery length issue), they switched to their very own Tizen platform instead, as during this development the Android Wear platform was not yet ready, and Samsung did not want to wait(they will have at least HTC, LG, and Motorola to contend with). Now, the biggest issue with Tizen is that it is an unproven platform, and that it is not Android. Several smartphones were supposed to have already been perfected in the Tizen platform, and so far only one has came out, and was quickly buried. So, there are simply not enough developers out there to progress this platform outside of Samsung. So for all we know, this could be another Nokia Symbian OS situation(Maemo and Meego, anyone?) where this Tizen platform is already obsolescent, and might be obsolete once Android Wear comes out and everyone else jumps on board and leaves Tizen in the dust. So although there is huge potential for this watch, we simply just don't know, and to support $200-300 to a soon-to-be defunct possibility is a lot for many consumers to bear.So should you buy this Galaxy Gear 2 line? I say if you don't already have one, and are itching to have such a cool gadget to complement your phone(like me), then I would recommend the Neo version over this more expensive brother. The ONLY 2 differences are that the Neo lacks the camera, and has a rubber band, instead of a metal one. But the $100 difference is more than enough to justify these 2 omissions. The 8-13MP camera in your phone will take much much better photos, trust me. And although the metal band does look cooler and more luxurious and sophisticated, the money you would save can go towards buying new bands, as they are interchangeable with any 22mm strap out there.Otherwise, if you are on the fence, I would say stifle your itches and urges, and wait for the LG and HTC watches that will be out in about 2 months from now. If I have learned one thing from their phones, LG and HTC will make beautiful and very functional smartwatches.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JBJ3HHO" id="B00JBJ3HHO-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-04:</strong> Great hardware!

Great utility to accompany my cell phone. Can't wait until Tizen OS is fully functional and shows me how much more this device can do. Only drawback would be that for fitness tracking, nutrition intake would be better if they were to collaborate with my fitness pal. They do not yet at this time, therefore I have Barcode scan on fitness pal and have to transfer to S health. Best Smart watch to date can't wait for glitches in programming but also sent Spanish version. Was angry but found out that didn't make a difference other than looking up free instruction book download on Samsung site.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JBJ3HHO" id="B00JBJ3HHO-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-17:</strong> This has been the best investment I have made in a while. I absolutely love this thing. It has made my life so much easier. From speaking reminders, to taking phone calls with hands full, to texting on the go. Love the step counter, yeah it's not 100% accurate, but it really helps give me an idea. The heart rate is great, yes you have to be still, take it easy and wait, but I have had this happen to me at the doctor's office, or at the machine that measures your blood pressure at the pharmacy. You need to be still to find out your heart rate and blood pressure, it's common sense. It is also really accurate. The camera is great. It takes really good pictures. I was at an event with celebrities that would not allow me to snap pictures with my phone, guess what I did. Yeah, they were far and it wasn't HD quality, but I still was able to have pictures for memories. Love the sleep tracker. The first thing I do when I wake up is see how i slept. It has helped me plan better to get better sleep. I connected it with bluetooth earphones and listen to music without my phone. Love the color and style.My friends are absolutely jealous. Especially the iPhone people, since Apple still has not figured out a smartwatch yet. Apple is on their downhill slope people, they are they next Blackberry. Samsung is just getting started.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JBJ3HHO" id="B00JBJ3HHO-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-15:</strong> This samsung gear 2 is perfect, it has a good design, it looks like pretty good and I recommend it for everybody, it is very usefull</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JBJ3HHO" id="B00JBJ3HHO-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-21:</strong> Got my Gold/brown version loaded a Rolex watchface with watch styler app looks like a several thousand dollar watch many expensive watch faces are available for free Tag Heuer, Dolce& Gabbana, Citezen, and lotsa of customized watch faces as well, you literally could have a different watch face every day for a month.The camera is surprisingly pretty good (had a common problem with first watch blurry focus, amazon replaced great service amazon) The watch is a camera, a speaker phone, a message center (texts,emails, notifications), game player, music payer, voice recorder, fitness tracker, remote control oh yeah schedule tracker, weather reporting and it tells time too.S-voice also allows you to ask some basic general knowledge question like tallest buildings, age of famous people, who is prime minister of UK stuff like that its actually pretty cool having all that info on your wrist. as well as allowing voice control of opening apps responding to calls and or messages, emails.The screen is by far the best one on a smart watch you can place your own pictures as the homescreen backround meening your watch can be as unique as you are.So glad they made it IP67 certified no longer have to worry about washing my hands or taking a shower with my watch on.App store is growing lots of useful stuff showing up on regular basis, calender apps, calculator apps, games like Pacman, Tetris, photo viewer, messenging app with keyboard (fleksy)Samsung is getting better with this newish wearables segment others have some catching up to do.Battery life is good 2-4 days depending on how much you play with watch</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JBJ3HHO" id="B00JBJ3HHO-review21" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-14:</strong> Basically i am an Iphone or windows guy. I hardly owned any android phones.I waited for a smart watch for windows phone but couldn't get any. So i switched to Samsung s5 to own a smart watch. S5 didn't appeal but Gear 2 did. Initially i ordered Gear 2 Neo thinking Camera is the only difference.But quickly realized the metal face makes a difference. Neo 2 is all plastic where Gear 2 is metal on face. So i bought Gear 2.Pros:Light weightclear displayScreen unlocks whenever i lift phone.Always ON pedometer.Apps may be build with awards and encouragement to use it in full potential.Unlocks phone if near to it.notifications. Though not a big deal for me.Bluetooth speaker phone. This makes a difference when you not carrying phone and u need to answer a call. As watch always on you , you can easily answer.If stolen or lost, you can try to ring it through watch.most times the phone is stolen and stays near you without knowing the thief. o this may help.Cons:Strap is small for me. I am a overweight guy but the strap could be little longer.battery runs for 2 days. I preferred it little longer. 5 days will be ideal.charging adapter. It should have built in port for charging. Or a wireless charging would be great.Pricy though not very expensive.Apps. Not much at this time.Not universal. If it is fine with HTC then i would have bought HTC M8. I believe this is a strategy as it can be easily compatible with any other android phone. Once S5 is old well they will open this for other phones.Charging is not quick. As the battery is small i believe it should take 30 min. But its more then an hour.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JBJ3HHO" id="B00JBJ3HHO-review22" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-11:</strong> I like how cool it is and I recommend it.

I tried the Pebble first and sent it back within a week.  I just did not work on my SamSung Galaxy Note 3.  The Gear 2 is great.  It does everything that I want it to.  It just works.  If you have a SamSung Smart phone this is the smart watch for you.  It cost a little more than the Pebble but believe me, it is worth every extra penny you might spend.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JBJ3HHO" id="B00JBJ3HHO-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-11:</strong> I have an AT&T; Gear 2 and have used it for 3 days now; it's coupled to a Note 3.I'd like to preface this long-winded review by stating my negative rating is based on the fact that I bought this device for its health-tracking benefits.  I don't find most of the Gear's general smartwatch functionality particularly useful for me as it would for most people.  If you don't care about the health tracking benefits, this is a very fine device.  4 or 5 starsThe bad -There are virtually no apps available for the phone.  Fitness oriented apps like Strava and Runtasitc were supposed to ship with this device but there are literally no third party apps that come with this watch.  The Samsung app store is also devoid of anything useful.The heart rate sensor is utterly useless.  I've owned a Mio Alpha wrist-based heart rate monitor for over 8 months and wrote a fairly critical two-star review because it would (about 25% of the time and only under vigorous activity) provide erroneous feedback. Note that the Mio cost $200 for the HRM feature ONLY... because that's all the Mio Alpha does - track your heart rate.  So dropping $100 more to have pedometer functionality along with a much more intuitive and feature-filled watch was very attractive to me.  Despite the Mio's shortcomings, it's still leaps and bounds more accurate than the Gear.  To give you an idea of how inaccurate the Gear is, it's not uncommon for the Gear to report a RESTING heart rate of 170+ which for me would be the absolute max output under the most intensive training.  When it's reporting 170 it should really be 55-60 max.  When I took it trail running it was all over the place.  When my heart rate was actually at 120 it would report 50... or sometimes 180.  It's all over the place.  The readings were off even if I had the strap on so tight it would be uncomfortable to wear for extended periods.  I've done a comparison where I would wear the Mio Alpha on my right wrist and the Gear on my left... the numbers were often within 2-3 beats but every now and then the Gear would shoot into the stratosphere at 160-180 while my Alpha was sitting in the 55-65 range where it should be.  The accuracy is so dismal that I'd be inclined to believe that Samsung may recall the units (if hardware related) to save their reputation rather than have all these utterly useless "health monitoring" devices floating around. Hopefully the problem is firmware/software related and an update will fix it. For now the heart rate function is useless to me.  My friend tried the watch and also had the same erroneous readings so I'm sure it's not my wrist being "odd" shaped or have blood flow/skin issues.  There is always a chance my HR monitor may be defective but I'm leaning towards a firmware or software issue that can hopefully be fixed.The watch does not offer continuous heart rate monitoring.  Of course this depends heavily on a properly functioning heart rate monitor which this device does not offer.  But for a device you wear all day the Gear should have an option for continuous heart rate monitoring as it will provide much more accurate caloric burn numbers when combined with pedometer data. I would have thought Samsung would have combined the two data points to provide a vastly more accurate daily caloric expenditure. Especially for active individuals that participate in sports or high intensity training.  This higher level of accuracy would put their product in its own league when compared to pedometer-only devices like the Fitbit and Nike Fuel band.  Hopefully a developer provides something soon. I'd definitely buy it.  To get continuous monitoring (not logging) you could technically go into EXERCISE and choose WALKING and just have it on all day (which I have done for the last three days to check the accuracy of the HR monitor) but then you'll have logs of walking sessions when you're clearly not walking all day and night.  It's also annoying to have in this exercise mode because even if you choose to have the clock screen show when you lift your arm, it will always default to the exercise program if it's currently running. Finally, the data is useless if not used in conjunction with and compared with pedometer data.  Samsung missed a big opportunity here.One thing I was looking forward to was the automatic unlocking feature of the Gear.  Basically when you're within a few feet of your phone (and wearing the Gear), the phone will automatically unlock without the need to enter a password.  Unfortunately you are forced to use the pattern lock to even use this feature.  From a security standpoint, pattern lock doesn't cut it for me. You don't even have the option for pin security - just the extremely low security pattern lock.  There should be an option to keep password lock in place and still offer the same proximity unlocking feature. This feature is more for kids, not professionals that rely on a secure device.The watch is a pain to silence if you are a light sleeper and charge your watch bedside.  There is a nice shortcut where you can double tap with two fingers any screen (while on) and you can adjust the volume/vibrate and brightness. However, you cannot put your watch on silent with this shortcut.  It's either volume 1 or vibrate.  No silence with NO vibrate.  So either I have to hear the phone beeping or vibrating on my nightstand or I have to go through this exercise - press menu key, swipe to settings, press settings, swipe to sound, press sound, press sound mode, then finally press mute.  I have to do that every time I go to sleep. The odd thing is when I wake up I just double tap the screen with two fingers and press the up button to vibrate and I'm set.  It just doesn't work the other way around.There is no ambient light sensor.  I would have given up that gimmicky IR blaster in favor of an ambient light sensor.  When transitioning from bright sunlight to indoors (and vice versa) it would be nice to have it auto dim or auto bright. Also at night it's too bright in darker rooms or when driving.  And when you do something as simple as turn your steering wheel when driving, the sensor activates the screen (as if you were lifting it to look at it but really you're just driving).  The screen going on and off all night while driving can be annoying even at the lowest brightness setting.  There needs to be a feature to quickly turn on and off the wake watch when lifting wrist option.I use a headset (wired) on my phone and I love that I can answer phone calls without pulling my phone from my pocket.  But for some strange odd unknown reason when I swipe to answer on the Gear, instead of my phone's headset being activated the speakerphone on the WATCH is activated.  I have to press another button on the watch to get it to transfer to my headset.  There should obviously be an option to have it answer directly to the phones bluetooth headset OR wired headset by default.And a few nice things about the watch -I never thought notifications on my watch would be something I'd want but it's definitely grown on me. Not having to pull the phone out of my pocket and unlock it to view what's most likely not a text or email that needs immediate attention is a big plus. Notifications however do not work consistently for Gmail and Go SMS. They work most of the time but not all the time. I have no idea why that is. There is a setting that the watch won't notify you if you are currently on your phone using it but when the screen is off and it's in my pocket it still won't notify my watch on occasion.  Notification for gmail (when it works) shows the name of sender on the initial notification and when you click on it the entire email can be read.  Notification for Go SMS will show the name and text when you click on it but if you receive two or more it will only show that 2 or more messages have been received and there is no way to read them off the watch. Didn't try it with the native messaging or email app as I don't use them.  I'm sure it probably has more functionality and may be more reliable in receiving notifications.The watch band seems durable and is fairly comfortable.  Not quite as comfortable as the Mio Alpha when on but it's easier to take on and off.  The band clasp is simple to use; the watch quickly comes on and off your wrist and no need to readjust once you get the right fit.  The fit and finish is nice to me but this is all very subjective.Even with my fairly heavy use the battery was consistently at 45-50% by the time I retired it to the nightstand at about 9 p.m.  That's 14 hours of use to a half full battery.  Not bad at all and definitely within the 2-3 days of "average" use purported by Samsung.  I should note that I have my brightness setting on a "3" all the time and I haven't taken the watch out on a daytime bike ride or run which would require a much brighter screen setting.The vibration module is strong enough that you don't really ever need to use sound notifications on the watch... at least for me.  That was a big plus for me because it's very common that I won't feel my phone vibrating away in my pocket when I receive a text or phone call so I'm required to have the ringer and notification volume on all the time.  Now I can live in complete silence and not annoy everyone around me yet still receive all my calls, texts and emails.The Gear's speaker is fairly loud and clear...  But I can't see myself ever using it.The "find my device"  feature is great at finding your phone after forgetting where you left it.  It uses your default phone ring tone as the locator sound; as an added bonus it works great in getting out of meetings or mundane conversations with coworkers... a couple sly presses of the watch screen and voila - phone rings and you abruptly say "Sorry that's my wife and I'm late to our anniversary dinner!!".The camera surprisingly takes decent pictures. Haven't tried anything in low light yet but those taken with plenty of light are very acceptable.  I'm sure it will come in handy when my phone's battery is too low to take pictures. Unfortunately the artificial shutter sound and beep is so loud (and impossible to turn off) that incognito snapshots are a no go. At least until someone comes out with an app to silence it.  It would come in handy at presentations and meetings where taking pics isn't disallowed per se but obnoxious and generally frowned upon.  Video quality is also decent but I don't see myself using it often if at all.Oddly the watch doesn't have a calculator. Back in my younger more nerdy days I absolutely loved my old Casio with full functioning calculator. Luckily there are third party options that cost only a buck or so. The one I found is a bit hard to use as the buttons are tiny but it works great when I need to run fast and dirty calcs while I'm working on my note 3.  No more switching back and forth from the phone's calculator or pulling out the pen and going through all those steps to get the tiny calc to pull up on the screen.Summary -The Gear 2 with its purported health/mobility/exercise features, particularly having a (reliable) built-in heart rate monitor and a more accurate pedometer than what my phone offers, pushed me into the "buy" category as I'm a pretty hardcore fitness freak.  Unfortunately the huge selling point that pushed me to buy the Gear doesn't even function as it should.  I'm hoping Samsung comes out with an update so their Fitness app can actually work with the phone/watch.  But most importantly, they need to fix the accuracy problem with their HR monitor.  For me, the fitness/health tracking aspects (alone) are what made me take the $300 plunge and therefore weighs very heavily on my paltry 2-star rating.  If they can get the HR monitor to work at least as good as the Mio's I'd give it 4 stars.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JBJ3HHO" id="B00JBJ3HHO-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-30:</strong> Honestly I think the watch is ugly but I changed the band with a stainless steel one and it looks a lot better. I like that there are a lot of features but honestly I don't use most. The notifications are by far the most useful to me.  I like using a custom watch face to match my mood or attire. Oh, the heart rate monitor is unreliable. I have a Note 3, so pairing wasn't a problem. The build quality is good, but the price is a little steep. A charge will last me a solid two days with moderate use, but I think I may be able to push it for maybe three days.

I decided to try a metallic case since the color on the others faded so quickly. I have had this case for a week and so far the color has remained true (I purchased the green). It is exactly the same as what is in the picture. The case is slim but still adds more bulk than I prefer. On the plus side, it has a soft padding on the inside which will help to prevent the phone from getting scratched by the case. It is very easy to take the case on and off. My biggest problem with the case is that some of my chargers can't be used with the case on. The opening is not wide enough for some chargers and I have to remove the bottom of the case in order to use the charger. This is very annoying and I would not purchase this case again.

This charger includes a coiled cable that is permanently attached - perfect!The build quality is very good. The charger feels substantial, with no rattling or poorly-fitting seams. It also looks quite nice - matte black finish that has more styling and visual interest than the typical power adapter. There's an indicator ring at the end that lights up (blue) to confirm it is working. The blue light is soft and is not horribly distracting at night. However, I would have preferred a single pinpoint indicator light rather than a ring.It fits securely into the power outlet without having to force it in or struggle to take it out. It did not jar loose when going over rough spots in the road.The attached cable is coiled and can stretch quite a distance. In its coiled state it extends about 20 inches; fully stretched out is about double that distance. I had no problems having the cord reach a tablet in the back seat from the center console power plug.The coiled cable cannot be detached from the power adapter, but since it is coiled, it does not get in the way if I leave the adapter plugged into the power outlet. There's also a conventional USB outlet at the end of the power adapter so you can use your own cable, or connect 2 devices at the same time.Zero problems with this, and I absolutely love the design. Highly recommend.[Sample provided for review]</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EJ4CE84" id="B00EJ4CE84-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-13:</strong> The Steepower Micro USB Car Power Adapter is one of those perfect on-the-go car chargers for most people.  Any device that uses a micro USB cord such as a Smartphone, MP 3 player, Kindle, or a digital camera can readily be charged.  I especially like the built-in cable.  No need to carry one along with you ... simply take the charger out of the glove box and you're good to go.Another interesting thing is the fact that the micro USB spring cable, a full six feet in length, can uncoil and be used in the backseat of your vehicle.  It's one of those plug and play type devices that make life so much easier.  It's also very convenient in that you can charge two devices at once.  One built in USB cable, the other you'll have to bring along.The basic specs are on the side of the unit.  The spring clips nicely secured the Steepower Micro USB Car Power Adapter into my lighter socket.  Once inserted into the socket there was about 1 1/2" sticking out.  The adapter works well, is very handy, especially when you're on-the-go and your phone or other small device needs a charge.WHAT'S IN THE BOX:&#9658;  USB Car Charger with a coiled Micro USB Cable&#9658;  Quick start guideSPECS:&#9827;  Input:  10 - 16V DC&#9827;  Micro connector output:  5VDC, 1A&#9827;  USB port output:  5VDC, 1AFEATURES:&#9658;  Charges Many Micro USB Devices&#9658;  Simultaneously charges a second device using the additional USB Port&#9658;  Works in any vehicle that has a lighter socket or accessory outlet&#9658;  Compact one piece design with coiled cable&#9658;  Micro USB coiled cable can expand up to 6 feet&#9658;  Illuminating blue LED light to indicate that the charger has power (on the interface around the additional USB port)Sample provided for review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EJ4CE84" id="B00EJ4CE84-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-01:</strong> I was provided a Steepower 12W / 2.1A Dual-Port Car Charger with Built-in Micro USB Coiled Cord for testing and review and was asked only to give my honest review, so this is what I found.What You Should Know Before You Buy:&#9830; "Dual-Port" for this cable means one built-in Micro USB cable and one normal USB port, not two actual ports.&#9830; Had no problem charging two phones at once, including an iPhone 5.&#9830; Had no problem charging an iPad.&#9830; Each port has a maximum of 1 Amp output.&#9830; Has a built-in cord with a Micro USB plug, so no extra cable needed for Micro USB devices.Detailed Review:&#9830; Look - The product came in a hanging display box with product information on the package. Inside the box was the Car Charger and a small instruction manual (which is mostly warranty information).  It is a standard looking car charger with a coiled cable with a Micro USB plug and a standard USB port for charging other devices.  It has an illuminated blue ring on the front of the charger.  It looks good with a nice, solid build.&#9830; Use and Performance - I went on a road trip this weekend with the family and replaced my usual dual port AmazonBasics car charger with the Steepower for the trip.  I used it the entire weekend to charge my iPhone 5 from the USB port and to charge my wife's Micro USB port phone with the included coiled cord.  It worked perfectly for both with consistent and fast charging results.  I also tried plugging in our iPad 2 and it also charged just fine.  The coiled up cable is convenient when you need it and stays out of the way when you don't.  Everything worked great.Conclusion:Overall, the Steepower 12W / 2.1A Dual-Port Car Charger performed perfectly during my road trip.  It had no problem charging two phones at once and was also able to charge our iPad.  The coiled cord made it compact for car use.  The performance is great and it is built very well. If you need a Micro USB car charger with an extra USB port for an additional device, this one is worth a look.

I've used several good ones, but the Steepower dual-port charger is one of the most innovative ones. It has a fixed cable with a micro-USB plug, plus a USB port for another cable (not included). The fixed cable is coiled, the first coiled cable that I've seen on a car charger, and a very nice touch that keeps the cable short but stretches to allow using a cellphone without first unplugging the cable. Each of the two ports provides up to one ampere, which is adequate to charge cellphones and tablets.I tested the charger with my Kindle Fire HD 7" and my wife's iPhone 4. Both were about 50% charged when we left the house, and both were turned on. After a 45-minute drive, making a couple of calls with the iPhone and playing music from the Kindle Fire, both devices had recharged considerably even while being used.This is a nice charger. It's solidly made and fit snugly but smoothly in the 12V outlet in the dashboard of my car. I was impressed with it enough that it's the power adapter that I'll keep in the car now.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EJ4CE84" id="B00EJ4CE84-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-01:</strong> TheSteepower 12W / 2.1A Dual-Port Car Chargeris ideal for the road warriors out there. This charger features one (1) USB charging port and one (1) USB coil cable featuring a Micro-B charger allowing you to charge up to 2 (two) devices simultaneously.This charger appears of great quality and functions as it should.  Individually, the coil cable and the separate USB charging port can provide up to 1A of power each.  It's important to note the total maximum output is 2.1A.  The charger features a dim blue circle indication light to let you know it is functioning properly.  I find this light useful and the dull nature of the light helps to keep it from being too bright during nighttime driving.The included and attached USB Micro-B cable is about 22" long and can stretch up to 6' in length.  This is perfect for reaching the back seat to keep the kids games and gadgets powered during long car rides.  It's also perfect to know you do not need to go looking for a spare cable to use with this charger and that it is always attached and available.Over that last couple days of use, I have found the charger to work great with my Android phone, and have had no issues charging my Asus Nexus 7 at the same time.  I have really grown to appreciate the permanently attached charging cable.  The spare USB charging port allows me to charge my MP4 Player or GPS at the same time making it really versatile.Overall, I think theSteepower 12W / 2.1A Dual-Port Car Chargeris a great charger, perfect for those who own devices that charge via Micro-B (most Amazon Kindle and Kindle Fire devices, most Android Devices, and so on).  The additional USB charging port leaves room to share with passengers or whenever you need to charge two devices at once.  This product is priced right and is a really good buy.Disclosure: I received a sample product from the manufacturer for the purposes of providing this review.

How wrong I was.Specs first: this charger has a fairly wide operating range of 10 to 16 volts DC for input and outputs 5 volts at 1 amp on the aux port and the cable (that is 1000 milliamps per the markings on the body). This easily charges my Samsung Galaxy Note II, which I connect to the cable and my friend's iPhone 4S (or her iPad when she brings it along) via the aux USB port. Each port outputs the 1000 mA, unlike some chargers that will split the output giving each device 500 mA. The micro USB end flawlessly inserts into my phone, which is something my previous charger did not. Indeed, the previous charger's micro USB plug has slightly distorted the phone's power port from poor tolerances.Right out of the box the first thing I looked for was the weak link in every other changer I've owned: the nut that holds the spring loaded tip and fuse assembly in place. On others the nut covers the entire barrel of the portion that plugs into the lighter socket and typically has coarse threads that will inevitably back off. When that happens the fuse, tip and spring will fly in different directions and this has happened more than once. Not so this. That assembly is housed in a separate assembly that is screwed into the body. It's practically impossible to come loose on its own, but still makes it relatively easy to change the fuse if ever you need to do that.The body of the device is solid and hefty. More importantly, it inserts and removes easily from my lighter socket, and the housing on the end for the second USB port is solid. In fact, the port is well designed and made because some ports - even on computers and other devices - require a little fumbling (and sometimes cursing) to insert the cable connector. This one does not exhibit that problem.Finally the cable, probably the most important part of this charger, isheavy-duty. In the past some of my chargers actually picked up my ignition system firing because of cheap cables and the fact that my car has a lot of radio frequency activity from the bluetooth connection to an FM retransmitter. This cable is ultra quiet and does not pick up external signals. If there is one complaint it's the cable is a tad too stiff. I have to exert a little more pull to extend it, but in the overall scheme of things that is a very minor complaint.Bottom line: this charger is a keeper and I am betting that it will long outlast the others that I have used - most of which fall apart of fail in some way after four to six months. This one is truly the Rolls-Royce of chargers.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EJ4CE84" id="B00EJ4CE84-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-22:</strong> Great product.

The USB port can charge your device at 1 amp while is great for any non-tablet device. This car charger gives a max output of 2 amps. The coiled cable is great so the cable does not get knotted. The lightning end is small so it will work with most cases. The lightning cable is Apple Certified/MFi Certified meaning that it will not give any errors when you go to charge your device. This is very important.I highly recommend this car charger.I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00EJ4CE84', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00EJ4CE84', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B008M5FR4Y</h2>    <p class="price"> $B008M5FR4Y</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

I purchased it on January 18, 2013 so I've had it about six weeks.First, the good news:The silicone part fits well.  Its purpose seems to be as a cushion for the hard case (which makes sense).  If you intend to use the hard case to completely enclose the phone and to holster it onto your belt (or what have you) it will provide adequate protection for you.  I've used it for this purpose a time or two and for this reason I gave it two stars.and then the bad news:If you intend to have the case only on the back of the phone so you can use the phone, this item will not provide the protection you need.  It is solid, however, the corners of the case do not wrap far enough around the phone to hold it in place.  It slides off - not completely - but enough so I don't have confidence it would protect the phone in the event of even a minor fall.  Also, if you intend to pull the phone out of the holster quickly enough to answer a call you will be disappointed.  It is an extremely tight fit.All in all, I would look elsewhere.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008M5FR4Y" id="B008M5FR4Y-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-22:</strong> this was not very expense  cover for my phone and love it,  love it love love love it love it</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008M5FR4Y" id="B008M5FR4Y-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-22:</strong> Although it looks great when on the phone the case keeps coming off.

It all fits snugly into the holster with belt clip. All of the side buttons work with the gel case on and there are handy hole covers that appear to be fairly well made and thought out.The kick stand works to lay the phone on its side to watch video's, movies etc...The belt clip on the holster also pulls out into a kickstand held in place by a rigid wire.I can not figure out why they put a kickstand on the holster though because the phone will only fit into the holster one way with the screen facing the felt backing. I am not sure why you would want to use a kickstand to see the back of the phone.Overall, I believe this is a good item and well worth the money. One note is that with a little persuading, like getting into a car, the holster will release from the belt clip. It will snap right back on but the first time it happened to me, I though I might have broken the holster.I have not done any real drop tests, so I can not speak to the protection factor for the phone. But with the gel case and the hard plastic cover, it is definately better than the phone by itself.

When I opened it up (I'm an electrical engineer... I had to open it, didn't I?) I found a decent circuit board, average components and the worst soldering job ever. What failed? The wires that were soldered to the back of the steel plug blades were cold soldered and came apart. Plus the blades were held in place with a friction fit which also failed, leaving exposed metal in the socket when the plug came apart. Construction is so bad that I estimate that the electrical integrity is likely just as bad and may actually harm delicate electronics like cell phones.

Here's what you get!</p>    <div class="features"><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008ER2U3Q" id="B008ER2U3Q-review1" style="display: block;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-24:</strong> Do you ever get tired of buying cases for your iphone 4s just to be disappointed case after case? I bought this case based on the product descriptions, the videos I saw online (company's website and on youtube) and high star ratings from reviewers here on Amazon.com. It seems like a reliable case, smaller than the Otterbox Defender(which I have on my 4S right now), less bulky and it looks cool. I am all for the cool factor (second only to protection and reliability). But much to my disappointment, this product did not meet half of my expectations. Here are the reasons why:1) I expected it to be life proof. It is not. I am a runner and I use my phone apps and music while running. To run with this case, you have to purchase the belt clip (MSRP $29.99), not included with the case. I think for $79.99, it should come with a case, shouldn't it? The Otterbox Defender, while bulky and also expensive, comes with a belt clip. So you probably are saying, "stop being frugal and just buy the belt clip." I was doing just that when I read the reviews for the belt clip. It seems that there are complaints about the clip scratching the case itself, some pin not engaging all the time, etc.I also listen to music on my 4S while driving(connected to a AUX via headphone jack). I find this a little cumbersome with this case because it has that screw cap on the headphone jack & you have to unscrew that cap every time you need to access the headphone jack. Now, why is this a problem? Because you always have to know where you keep the cap. Mind you, it's a small piece, which can easily be lost. You are probably saying, "oh that's your problem and not the case design." Trust me, when you lose that small screw cap, you will be thinking, I wished they designed the case in a way that you don't have to detach anything to access the headphone jack.The charger cover(bottom of the case) is also poorly designed because it gets in the way of the charger cable. I opened it a few times and tried to plug the iphone car charger--it is not as accessible as I wanted it to be. It also looks like it would easily break from the hinge. I am not risking that.If you are a dynamic iphone user like me (meaning you access your phone a lot; be it charging it, using your earphones, etc.), this case will not keep up with you. Don't take my word for it. Try it.2) The buttons are stiff. Try it on your iphone and you will understand what I mean.3) You will later realize after your purchase that this is not worth the $79.99 that you paid for. Again, do not take my word for it; try it.Right now, I am back to my Otterbox Defender case until I find the next best thing. This is my personal experience with the LifeProof case and I understand that not all users are the same. I just want to share with you that this case did not meet my expectations.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008ER2U3Q" id="B008ER2U3Q-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-29:</strong> I really like the concept of this case. Finally, I don't have to worry about dropping my phone in the toilet after one too many shots of Crown. I could use my iPhone as an underwater camera while on vacation. I could take a long bubble bath and watch YouTube videos or text message. It's a wonderful concept.So far, I really appreciate the protection. I have showered/bathed multiple times with my iPhone and have come to discover that this case is the real deal in terms of guarding the iPhone from water damage. I have yet to drop my phone in the snow or confront it with an electric shock, but am incredibly pleased thus far.However, the design of the case (obviously fortified for maximum protection) compromises some aspects of the phone. First off, the ports are harder to access with this case. The headphone port requires an extraneous device in order to connect with headphones. Also, several third-party chargers will not fit in the charging port with the case intact.I've also noticed that the speaker quality is disreputed by this case. While talking on the phone, it's a bit harder to hear the person I'm talking to, and I've realized that it's due to this case.Overall, I love the quality of the case itself. I dislike how difficult it causes other aspects of the phone to be.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008ER2U3Q" id="B008ER2U3Q-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-20:</strong> My sixteen year old son wanted this for his bday we got it for him and it does what it says!

Its a great product for what it really is and really admire the o-ring design and perfect fit and slim design but this is not for the very large majority of people. I was very patient trying to get use to it but ended up returning it:- Speaker is muffled and at least 25% less sound- Microphone is muffled ... had to keep repeating myself and speaking much louder on phone calls- Speaker phone echoes- Phone reception was a little worse causing dropped calls ... don't really know why but this is definitely a true- I had an Otterbox previously which also has a built in screen protector and easy texting from day one and the Lifeproof was not near as sensitive/produced lots of mis-entered typing- Only OEM charger will fit ... had to buy adapters for all my chargers- Overheats much quicker if leave it in sun in Arizona when outdoors- The door design for charger makes it a little tricky (you get use to it) to insert the charger- No silicone on backside so my phone hit the floor 10x as much as it did in any other case as slides around on all surfaces- Design does not feel well in hands in general- Annoying to have to take out the headphone plug to insert headphone jack- Screen protector seems to get marked up easy- ExpensiveDon't know what I was thinking, if its waterproof there are going to be some major downsides for general use. Really surprised how amny of these have sold and are pushed heavily in the big box stores too ... it should be a niche only product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B008ER2U3Q', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B008ER2U3Q', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B009KT0Y7G</h2>    <p class="price"> $B009KT0Y7G</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

The last reason was somewhat cleared, as my brother purchased an extended battery for his Samsung Note. He loves it!Coming from an iPhone 4, knowing the cost of the accessories are usually exuberant, I decided to take the plunge given that the cost was less than $18 for the battery and a new back cover. I purchased it on June 10th 2012. I received it the next day and popped it right in to my phone. From the first moment, I could not be happier. No issues whatsoever. I drained it completely (with ease), per the instructions that came with it, the first day and charged it overnight. I did the same thing the next day. By the third day I noticed that my battery was taking a lot longer to drain. Following the instructions did help and I can tell you that I have trouble draining this battery; I have tried many times and only succeeded four times, including the first two times when I first got it.I consider myself a power-user as I am always on my phone for my emails, personal and work, pictures of my family, YouTube videos (for review of apps or accessories) and Hulu Plus and Netflix at night. I unplug my phone from the charger at 6AM and leave it on all day until 10:30PM when I shut it off and plug it in for the night. Usually it would still have between 4% and 14%.I could not be happier. It has since been my only battery I use and love. I would buy again and will recommend to all my friends who own a Samsung Galaxy S II Epic 4G Touch.As a final note, I did read in one of the reviews for the battery + cover made by Tim (http://www.amazon.com/review/R2CG1LAM5427T8/ref=cm_srch_res_rtr_alt_1) to purchase the Trexcell Black Thermoplastic TPU Cover Case for Sprint Epic Touch 4G Extended Battery, found here (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006X1FZXC/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i01) Great case and it fits like a glove. It needs a little Mod/Hack to the ports, charge and headphone with a Dremel to make it bigger. Other than that, I love it.I hope this helps you.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0069RQMWS" id="B0069RQMWS-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-02:</strong> The battery is twice the capacity of stock, yet seems to last three times longer.

Well, I have now been using it for a few months, and the product is ... decent. The backing doesn't go on and off with quite the right feeling that the stock back does. The bulge on the back is awkward. Having to condition the battery is a serious inconvenience that should be handled by the manufacturer. And what does all this get me in the end?

(We have The US Cellular Galaxy S2 SCH-R760 which is the same physical phone as the Epic Touch 4G SPH-D710)  After following the direction included with the new batteries...and now after a weeks use...I can report that the phones duty-time is amazingly increased with these new batteries compared to the original batteries.  I get a full days heavy use from these phones now without recharging all day long.  The new covers that came with the batteries are also better than I expected them to be.  They are made well and have a silky finish to them.  They snap on just like the original covers and all the surfaces match well.  I can say I am very pleased with the purchase...so far so good.I had to search the internet to find holsters that would be compatible with the now fatter phone.  Not a lot of choices that I could find that allow for the fatter battery cover area.  I ended up ordering the Seidio HLSSEPTAS Spring-Clip Holster which I have not received yet.  In the mean-time to get me by, I took the old slide-in holsters that I bought with the phones and used a dremel tool and cut out the back of the old holster to allow for the new fatter cover area and surprisingly it seems to work well.  I now am not sure I even need the new holsters that I ordered but they have already been shipped.  I might do a review of the holsters when I have had chance to try them out.I read some reviews about bad covers being supplied with the batteries but I assume these were an older design...the ones that come now are in my opinion very good.  I can't speak to the batteries life span as I have only had them for a week but there is no doubt in my mind that the early returns are good!  I will edit this review if I find quality problems down the road.T Johnson  East Winthrop Maine.update Dec 4 2012  I am still very happy with the batteries.  Working just fine since I bought them about 6 months ago.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B0069RQMWS', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B0069RQMWS', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B005B3RFTU</h2>    <p class="price"> $B005B3RFTU</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

I used to hate my horrible battery life with my sensation even after I rooted it. I mean it did improve by rooting, installing custom roms and kernels. But can you really have enough battery life? You always want more and more. I initially tried the stock htc battery for the evo 3d since I heard it works with the sensation but wasnt much of an improvement from the stock htc senstaion battery. Plus as I noticed htc batteries just get hot way too much and way too easily. With the anker battery it doesnt get hot as much. The cooler it stays the longer the battery life. In addition the anker provides more capacity at 1900mAh. Im getting about 30% improvement in battery life and usage from the stock htc senstaion battery now. Since my phone is rooted and I have ARHD 3.6.5 and the 1.4r1 bricked kernel installed I may get more or less battery life than others. My usage battery life for light usage is about 40 hours and about 16 for medium usage. I can get about 8 hours of continuous talk time. The batteries are a incredibly good deal at 2 batteries and a charger for $29. I am very happy with them so far. Have owned them for about 2 months now. If your trying to decide between the anker and the stock htc evo 3d battery for your senstaion then get the anker its way better by far. Much better value. Im tempted to get more just so I always have a spare. You never know when you will need it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005B3RFTU" id="B005B3RFTU-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-28:</strong> This works good for trips, but in reality, it would be cheaper just to buy a battery booster charger pack.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005B3RFTU" id="B005B3RFTU-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-18:</strong> Great purchase. The batteries extended the life of HTC Sensations my wife and I own. The original battery for the HTC Sensation is 1520mAh. My batteries would last me though 4pm-6pm with my normal use. With these new batteries - the phones lasted until bed time. (stock build). Once i switched the phones to CM10 - my batteries now last close to 36 hours without a charge - but that is saying something on quality of the CM10 build.Anyway - you will see a rather good improvement in the battery life with your phone if you buy these.

I was hoping they would last longer, but they are certainly acceptible and a slight improvement over what I had. I would have given 5 stars but the charger is a little difficult to use. The pins should lock in place since it is very hard to get them in position and have they stay that way while you try to get the battery into the spring loaded charger. It would be much easier to work with  if the pins simply could lock in place. But for the price it is certainly acceptible. A big plus is you can use the charger for almost any battery and it has a usb port so for travelling it is all you need no matter how many different phones you have.

Once figured out, the charger did a perfect and pretty fast job.

These batteries are amazing. My phone used to only last about 3-4 hours on heavy WiFi hotspot, WFi, internet radio, and GPS use. Got ridiculously annoying having to keep it charging all the time. These batteries have saved me. With the same heavy use plus some gaming and talk time, I still get around 8 hours usage. If I dont use my wifi, GPS, and games too much, I can pretty much still go to bed and have about 10% battery life left. I bought two of these with the universal charger whose contacts can be adjusted and I'm pretty much set for two days. I would say that the only drawback is that once the battery life does show around 3%, the phone just dies. I'm thinking this is due to the batteries being from a 3rd party. The awesome battery life is worth it though.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005B3RFTU" id="B005B3RFTU-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-04:</strong> Don't know if it was the battery or not, but after I started using these batterys, my camera went dead(hardware not software)have better than stock life, and fit the mytouch 4g slide perfect</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005B3RFTU" id="B005B3RFTU-review21" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-21:</strong> Two Scenarios:Scenario 1:  You own an iphone.  You can't even change the battery.  You're forever in search of the nearest plug to charge it up yet again, hoping against hope you'll have enough plug time to keep the battery going until lunch!Scenario 2:  You own an Android phone and you can easily remove the battery and replace it with a fresh fully charged one.Scenario 2 with Anker batteries and chargers will radically change your life for the better!  I previously owned an HTC Sensation and had two Anker batteries and a charger.  It was awesome!  The batteries were so much better than the stock battery that I ended up just throwing it out.  The Anker batteries would last, depending on use, anywhere form 12 - 40 hours, IF I charged them in the Anker charger.  For some reason charging in their charger made the batteries last far longer than charging through the phone.Now, I own the Samsung Galaxy 3 and two Anker batteries.  I kept the stock battery and keep all three in rotation.  The Galaxy 3 uses a lot more power than the Sensation but I'm getting about 8 hours of heavy use out of the Anker batteries.  I only get about 6-7 out of the stock battery.But here's the magic.  I start the day with three fully charged batteries.  When the first one gets to about 25% - usually around 4:00, I put the second one in and the first one goes back to the charger.  It will be charged long before I'll be able to deplete the other two.  If I'm going to be out all day I'll take all three with me.  But I've never had to use more than two.It's so amazing to know I can use the phone as much as I like, power up all the accessories and background apps, including the GPS - and still never have to worry about finding a plug - until I get home.  When I do get home, I have a cradle that charges one battery while it's in the phone, and it charges one additional battery.  And I have the Anker USB charger for the third battery.  So I can charge all three batteries simultaneous - and still use the phone at the same time.The Anker batteries are 2200mAh compared to the stock battery's 2100mAh.  And they last noticeably longer.  If you get these two and keep the stock battery you could have your phone on non-stop for 24 hours before having to worry about finding a socket.It's Power Heaven!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005B3RFTU" id="B005B3RFTU-review22" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-09:</strong> Still working like a champ. Still get good life from the batteries, but now getting ready to retire the phone and the batteries. The bottom of the rubber is falling off on both batteries. I think a little superglue will fix it, but it doesn't seem like its built to hold up physically like the oem. But the charge life is much better then the original battery. I would probably say atleast 1.5-2 hours longer than the original. Also depends on what you use your phone for. I can last a full day before charging at night. Recommend that you charge often with the original Anker charger to keep the cycle counts consistent. Noticed the charge lasts longer that way versus connecting the phone to an AC to micro usb. I think the trickle charge makes the difference.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005B3RFTU" id="B005B3RFTU-review23" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-27:</strong> Decent batteries, It does increase the battery life for my htc sensation by a couple hours on a normal day with low usage. Under heavy usage like playing a game constantly, or watching a movie (stuff that drains the stock battery in aprox 2hrs) i'd say it adds a good 20 mins. That could be the difference in finishing the movie or game. I don't really like the charger cause it takes forever and a half (about 4 hrs) to charge a battery. Plus it's sensitive to being plugged in via the microusb, doesn't always work. I really wish atleast one of those annoying prongs was fixed in place. After the second use, I noticed that all the rubber/plastic on the battery between each lead was broken. I've seen friends chargers that are a heck of a lot easier to put the battery in, and they don't damage the batteries, and they charge fast. I give it 4 stars despite the charger because the batteries do extend life, and it's nice to have a couple backups.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005B3RFTU" id="B005B3RFTU-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-27:</strong> now it is 3 week that i'm using this battery. at first time i thought that it is horrible battery because of hot reboots and percentage drop, but after 3-4 full cycle everything disappeared. this battery perform better than OEM, but missing temp sensor. also you can see on photos  with average usage it has 79% after 18 hours</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005B3RFTU" id="B005B3RFTU-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-12:</strong> great backup batteries and the ideal charger.

It's great to get this, especially since it comes with a charger, so you never run out of power. These batteries also run cooler, too, which keeps the phone much cooler overall, it seems the processor doesn't have to pull from a hot battery, so it keeps it cool too, somehow. Either way, DEFINITELY buy. I use them for my Evo V 4G with virgin mobile, and With a custom ROM, s-off, and rooted.

It is 1900 mAh, which 170 mAh more than the original and trust me it is really noticeably longer life in my Evo 3D.  Before I would only get about 10 hours of life on moderate use, now it is about 16-18 hours.  You get 2 for an awesome price.  If Sanyo Eneloop are the kings of AA/AAA rechargeables (I own A LOT of those, they are that great), these Ankers are right up there.  I did try some cheap 1930 mAh for about $10 for 2 and it didn't work out well.  I also notice Anker making laptop batteries which also have 4+ stars.The charger is so convenient.  I know instructions are bad but you can't mess it up.  Place the battery by sliding the white portion down to fit your battery model and align the two pins.  It doesn't matter if the battery is backwards, as long as you touch the negative and position terminals to the gold pins it will light up and ready to be charge.  It is reverse polarity intelligent.  Red indicates charging and blue is done.  I notice it takes about 3-4 hours so a little bit longer compared when the battery is being charged inside the phone.  Slow charging is good for the battery anyways!  Don't remove the charger from the outlet until it is bright blue, there is a brief phase of pink led color (change from red to blue) that may last about 15 minutes.  I use it to charge my fiancee's batteries, nintendo gameboy advance, and my SimplyVibe speakers.  I only carry this universal charger when we travel.  The usb port works great for simultaneous charging with the phone.  I rarely use the micro USB port to charge it but it works too.To conclude, I'm very satisfied with Anker batteries and the charger.  You can get them on eBay for $18 but those batteries will have 1800 mAh with the charger instead of 1900 mAh.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005B3RFTU" id="B005B3RFTU-review31" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-21:</strong> It's always good to have two batteries for the smart phone that use battery fast.

Well not only is this a great deal, but it's a superb product!  I'm not just, "Meh, it was only $30."  I'm more like, "WTH!?  These were only $30!"  You never realize the handiness of a battery charger as opposed to a phone charger until you've got one!  Especially when it comes with TWO batteries!  No more being tied down because your phone's gonna die.  Just pop in the already charged battery and put your dead on the charger.  Voila.These batteries have a little bit higher of capacity (1900mAh vs 1730mAH) so I was expecting them to last a little longer than my OEM battery, but NOT A LOT LONGER!  I swear these last alllllll day.  Literally a 24 hour period can go by before I have to charge these.I recommend you root your phone so you can recalibrate your battery and phone.  It's a lot easier said than done, I know, especially now with HBOOT 1.50, but it can be done.  I did it and now I'm noticing even more longevity.  Add that with the CPU Tuner app (for rooted phones only) and you're set.Best deal ever.

Turns out, after doing many drains and charge ups, I max out at 12-14 hours with 2.5 max screen on. This review is written passed the 1.1 month mark or so, so I've had plenty of time to test out different roms/kernel combinations and even revert to cold stock. I keep my data and wifi off for 90 percent of the time since I don't really need it. But its ridiculous how much more the battery is lasting compared to stock. Not even 2 hours different.Just when I thought my ocd of constantly checking the battery level would be gone....At the beginning, I was getting 22 hours max with moderate use 30 hours with no use at all just to test the run down. I don't believe its my phone thats the problem. My sister has the same phone as I do and she also doesn't use her phone as much but the battery runs down quickly.Maybe I have a faulty battery? Because I've checked XDA and other reviews state they have 2 fulls days on light usage!! I can't even get a day of light usage.On the bright side, the external charger is terrific! :]2 star given-----------------------------EditSo after this review that I made about the batteries, LaptopMate, the seller was very helpful and backed their words and sent me 2 new batteries which arrived in the mail very quickly. I can now say that the new batteries that were sent to me is performing outstandingly. I'm easily pushing out 2-3 of light usage, leaving my 4g and sometimes 2g on the whole time. But of course, your mileage will vary. I rooted and changed roms and kernels around to match my usage and I'm getting the results I got and couldn't be happier. Laptop mate did a great job in the customer service and couldn't recommend them or the batteries more. As of this edit, the external charger pins is starting the sink into their boxes...which I hope will not be a problem in the future.5 star given</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005B3RFTU" id="B005B3RFTU-review36" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-11-12:</strong> Both batteries work great.

I was worried I might only be able to charge them using the supplied charger but that's not the case. I can charge these just fine inside my phone with the regular charger that comes with the phone.The battery life on these is roughly 4+ more hours than the factory battery.Probably for 2 main reasons.1) These batteries have more physical capacity than the standard ones that come with the phone.2) These batteries don't get as hot as the standard ones under use. A hot battery drains faster and loses max capacity faster than a cold battery, so that helps these stay alive longer.I bought the 2 pack because I wanted to give one to my friend with the same phone as a gift. She loves the battery as well.Now I keep the standard battery in my backpack as an emergency backup but I never need it.I keep my 4G and WIFI connections ON 24/7 and I do a moderate amount of web browsing, gaming, phone calls and texting on my phone and this battery lasts all day and still has about 30% when I get in bed. EXCELLENT battery.As a bonus, the charger that comes with it is great, it can charge all kinds of cell phone batteries and can be adjusted to fit them. The light turns red when you stick your battery in and starts to transition to purple when it's near complete. Then it turns bright blue when it's done charging and has a built in overcharge prevention system.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B005B3RFTU', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B005B3RFTU', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B0082DP778</h2>    <p class="price"> $B0082DP778</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

Besides the standard phone calls and texting, you can take still photos and videos, watch YouTube videos, download books, play games, read your e-mail, surf the internet, use Google maps, check Facebook, listen to music, use a calculator, check the news and weather, and much more.  The phone has a 3.5 inch Capactive touch screen, weighs 4.25 ounces, and measures 4 x 5 x 2.47 x 0.39 inches.  The 1520 mAh lithium-ion battery is rated for up to 7.2 hours of talk time and up to 10.5 days of standby time.After what turned out to be a disastrous experience with thePCD Venture Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile), I needed a new cell phone.  I've been very happy with the LG Optimus Elite.  It does everything well - I've had no problems making phone calls, texting, surfing the Internet, buying apps, taking pictures, watching videos, etc.  The sound is nice and crisp and I've had no problems with dropped calls.  The keyboard is a bit tiny and I take full advantage of the Voice Import voice recognition software that allows me not only to dictate text messages but surf the Internet, send e-mail, and more.  The camera/camcorder takes nice pictures.  The GPS is a nice bonus - I use a handheld GPS to do geocaching but it's nice having the GPS on the phone if I decide at the last moment to look for a geocache and I don't have my GPS with me.  The phone uses the Sprint 3G network and I've been pleased with how easy it is to use the internet on my phone - no matter where I am.  The battery lasts a long time - much longer than other cell phones I've had.The LG Optimus Elite is part of Virgin Mobile's Beyond Talk Plan (meaning I pay a monthly fee rather than topping up every three months) but there is no contract and it is a nice phone and well worth the monthly fee.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0082DP778" id="B0082DP778-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-07:</strong> LG Optimus Elite (Virgin Mobile)this was a gift and the person enjoys the phone and has bought many accessories for it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0082DP778" id="B0082DP778-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-29:</strong> I do not have to much to say, or I just do not want to write to much about noting.

That phone only has 150mb of user space, this one has about a gig (4 GB total, 1 GB user accessible). One less complaint I will be hearing...I am very impressed with this handset. As others have noted it actually has a 1 Ghz Snapdragon type processor, not the 800 mhz listed, along with 512mb of RAM. It is very fast and smooth in operation. Running Android 2.3.7 helps enormously (a huge upgrade from the Froyo previous Optimus Vs were running). Not worried about whether ICS is coming to it, Gingerbread does the job just fine.The wifi receiver seems very fast, and the GPS (a real GPS, BTW) acquired a lock and fix almost immediately.Screen size is 3.5", which doesn't sound like much of an improvement over the 3.2" of the Optimus V until you put them side by side. The Elite's screen is *much* easier to type on. It's the same size as an Iphone (it actually looks alot like one...)I have been toting around a Droid X for a year and a half yolked to Verizon. I am starting to think that the wife just got me beat...I'd highly recommend this one to anyone looking for a decent Android phone and who is trying to avoid the ridiculous costs of a contract with the big carriers. For $150 up front and between $35 and $55 a month you get the full experience.VM is going to make alot of money off of these, I think.EDIT: One week later, and the OE has lost a star. I had to return the first unit because some malfunction was killing the battery FAST. It would die in less than 6 hours. I have been using Androids for a couple of years and know all the tricks, couldn't get the first one to settle in. Took it back and exchanged it for another one, and after some fiddling I have the battery sipping juice. The replacement unit has been acting a bit quirky too (one random reboot, some strange stuff involving the Wifi reciever and call/messaging lags, which toggling Airplane mode seems to fix fine) but I *think* I have it running fine now... And when it's running fine it's still a 5 star phone for the price.I docked it a star because the first one was a lemon and the second one has been acting funny, but seems tight as of now. I can't give something with that record 5 stars. Still, this is an impressive phone for the price tag. I'd still upgrade to it from the OV, it is just that much better a phone. I would say that with the issues I have had, though, someone with little knowledge of the Android OS or inclination to play around with the settings (like my wife) might have a hard time with this phone. It is finicky, but when calibrated right it runs like a champ.Just be ready to send it back or exchange it, because it seems this initial batch obviously has some defective units floating around. Amazon has a great return policy, so I wouldn't worry about it.EDIT 2: A few weeks later and the OE is running like a champ. It is sipping battery after a couple of changes (Airplane mode resets a couple of times, mostly) and running smooth and fast. Wife is getting home with 40% battery after 12 hrs continuous no charging, not bad for a small, thin phone. Now Otterbox just needs to make a case for it...The wife is very happy with it compared to the OV. VM is finally starting to get some really good phones out there.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0082DP778" id="B0082DP778-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-06:</strong> I purchased the phone through amazon on Friday 7/20/12, received it 4 days later and so far so good.  I was able to install a 16gb class 10 mini SD card, added about 50 apps, half of which I still currently use most of the time and I still have about 160 to 199M memory left.  Whatever apps could be saved on the SD card, I did so to save internal memory.  Thinking back, my old phone (also through Virgin Mobile) was a Samsung Intercept and I usually experienced crashes due to lack of internal memory.With my old phone, I deleted as many apps as I could and monkeyed around with it, but it still got bogged down.  Enter...LG Optimus Elite!  In some ways, it does remind me of my old phone, but the screen is obviously larger. Unlike the Intercept, I find myself using styli more often then not.  I also picked up a keyboard that allows me to type in larger blocks of text for notes, etc.  It uses blutooth and I have to remember to go through some steps to use that. I had to order bypassing software in order to run it for my phone though a company overseas.  Well worth it to me though.  Read my other reviews about that story.I found a protector frame (silicone?) for the phone which makes it look more like an I phone.  I also have become efficient in removing the outer and inner frame in order to remove the battery, should it become necessary.  And to think I also bought that other phone which prevents you from doing so.  Speaking of battery, it doesn't last an entire 24 hours even with the GPS turned off, etc.  I do keep a few alarms up as well as a weather updater.The surprise with Virgin Mobile for me was that my monthly rate was going up.  I guess I should have read all the very fine print provided on the website stating which models or release dates pertained to that change.  Turns out, I don't mind so much since I made sure to use only wifi at home and the most minutes I've used are around 200 minutes/month, so I was able to stay with the cheapest plan now offered.  I can also watch a movie streaming over 3G or wifi, no problem.  THAT, my old phone could never do.  Internet searches are now pretty good and I've used it often to compare online prices to store's prices, not to mention, read reviews on amazon.com.All in all, I like this new phone pretty much and I would carry more often, but the added frame makes it a little to heavy to just throw in my pocket.  I certainly wouldn't put it in a pocket without a case or protection of some kind.  After I have had it a year, I'll update the review.  I may not, if the phone is rendered old school like so many have before.6/25/13: 1 year update (11 months actually).  First, that silicone hybrid protector has been a phone saver for me.  I can't tell you how many times my hubby dropped his HTC EVO V 4G out of his front shirt pocket when leaning forward.  Silicone = staying stuck in place.  As for the phone, it's on it's last legs. Good thing that I bought it with the amazon card promo.  That puts it at almost $8.00 per month for me (would have been $11.80/month at full price).Current problems: 1) The charging port is getting loose, 2) I am now not getting notifications of my calls and texts, for the most part (my first hint that I'm getting a call is when VM notifies me of a voice mail message...I did check my prefs to make sure that calls aren't getting sent to VMail), 3) getting a signal is more difficult than ever, 4) I'm able to get home long before my text gets to my intended party (I send an "I'm on my way" message before I take off...15 minutes later, bing!)but I'm already home.  That last one could be Virgin Mobile's doing, not sure how.  I'm now looking at Samsung Galaxys, jelly bean.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0082DP778" id="B0082DP778-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-07:</strong> I got this for my wife because she didn't want to spend the extra money on the HTC 1 V.

While I use my finger much of the time, I don't want to when I'm eating, just put hand lotion on, etc.The amCase (TM) Ultra-sensitive 2-in-1 Capacitive Stylus for Apple iPad, iphone was the second stylus I bought for my Evo 3D. After a disappointing experience with the first stylus I bought, I was hoping for a better experience with a higher priced stylus.I wasn't disappointed in the way the amCase Ultra-sensitive stylus wrote on my capacitive touch screen. The experience was very smooth, very responsive. I have absolutely no complaints regarding the way the stylus works with my Evo 3D.To add even more functionality, the amCase stylus is a regular pen on the other end, making it very useful for moments when you actually have to write on real paper. The pen function writes well, although it isn't the best pen I've every used. That really wasn't quite as important to me as long as it wrote well and gave me the versatility of a combination pen/stylus.It also has a clip on the side that holds the stylus very securely on shirts, purse pocket, etc. I kept it clipped to the POUCH that I bought for my Evo 3D so it was always handy when I wanted it.Where the amCase stylus failed me is in the design. It is comfortable enough to hold and use, but the major flaw in its design lies in the screw mechanism that opens the pen and allows the pen to be refilled. Within a week, this screw came undone and the half with the stylus tip fell off. Of course this couldn't happen in my purse or in my house, but in a store. I didn't notice until I got home and went to put my phone on the charger.I struggled with how to rate this. The stylus and pen work well enough that I can't rate it with one star, although the ease with which the stylus falls apart and is lost is a complete design failure. I can't in good conscience give it more than two stars, and I feel generous in doing that. With an original price point of about $25, this stylus should have a better, more reliable design. As it is, I wouldn't recommend it even at the much lower sale price it is currently sold at.As an alternative, I prefer the styluses below. Neither has a pen function, only a stylus, but they work well, are reasonably priced, and have a much more reliable design.*3M Smart Pen - Grey Clip-On Design - Precision Touch Pen for Mobile Handheld Devices*3 Pack of Universal Touch Screen Stylus Pen (Red + Black + Silver)**UPDATE ADDED 09/10/11**After I posted the review above, I was contacted by AM Express, who said they believed I had received a defective model and asked that I verify my shipping address so they could send a replacement. Within a few days of receiving the replacement, I tucked it in my jeans pocket thinking I'd be using it when I reached my destination but it fell out of my pocket and was lost. I had not used the clip to attach it to my jeans, merely slipped it inside my pocket, so this was not the fault of the design, just bad luck. Unfortunately, I didn't have the second stylus long enough to determine if it was indeed better than the first one I wrote about in my review above.So, I ordered a third amCase stylus. I truly hoped that the first one I received was merely defective and that I would have a better experience with the next one. The third one arrived already broken. I had it shipped to my office, opened it downstairs in the receiving area, and found the problem before I even made it back upstairs to my desk. The end with the silver tip that is attached to the shirt clip was broken and wobbly, making the shirt clip unreliable. When I returned to my desk, I filled out an RMA with Amazon and sent it back the next day for a refund.It was nice of AM Express to send the replacement stylus, although I think their gesture was motivated by their desire to have me replace this review with a positive one and was not necessarily born out of good customer service. I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt, but I've received several emails from them asking that I update my review. So, here it is. I've had three of these styluses and two of them were broken and the third lost within days so I couldn't determine whether it was better or not. Seriously, though, what are the chances that one customer would receive two defective units unless there is a problem with the design or manufacturing of these styluses?</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0056TO3P8" id="B0056TO3P8-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-11-28:</strong> It does register when using on an Android pad but it's more like a pokey finger than a stylus or pen. If you want to keep your pad from having so many finger prints then this will work however if you want to use as a freehand input device for quill or other applications forget it.  It sort of drags with a lot of friction over the surface and is made more cheaply than those throwaway pens you get for free. My advice is wait until vendors put something out which actually works- this doesn't. Not even a little.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0056TO3P8" id="B0056TO3P8-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-08-27:</strong> This stylus works well with my Android tablet. I can draw and scroll as well as push buttons. Most other stylii on the market cannot smoothly and reliably scroll or draw. The pen function also works pretty well.Unfortunately, build quality is mediocre. The parts are not well finished and many customers are reporting that their stylus is falling apart after only light usage.Also, the price keeps jumping around between $4.99 and $11.99. At $4.99, it's worth taking a chance on getting a decently built sample. At $11.99, I'd look elsewhere or wait for a better price.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0056TO3P8" id="B0056TO3P8-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-14:</strong> It Works well with basic use to go from screen to screen and selections.

I can tell that it's shielded, the connectors are constructed well, and it's made from a decent quality wire.  I tested charging with theUSB Power Meterand found that it was capable of delivering 1.81 Amps to the iPad for rapid charging, that is compared to 1.98 Amps with the Apple 3ft cable.  1.81 Amps is consistent with all 6ft cables, even the best, most expensive cables on the market so you won't find better (I've tried.)  The .17 Amps less is a small sacrifice for the added length and still well within rapid charging speed for an iPad.  For iPhone which only draws 1Amp, there is no loss.  You get full power.I have seen some negative reviews and I don't understand why.  This is one of the highest quality 3rd party cables I've ever bought, is well constructed, stands up well to daily use, and works perfectly with my Apple devices.  Perhaps it wasn't as good and the quality improved by the time I bought it or there were some defective ones.

For me, application was easy, getting it on the first try. I followed the directions exactly. The trick is to go nice and slow. Don't apply too much pressure on the top until you have it lined up perfectly around the speaker/sensors etc and aligned on the sides, then hold the top of it down with your finger as you peel the rest. Came off nice and smooth, bubbles disappeared with a few swipes of the included card. No problem.Now, as for the look...it's spot on. Other than the border, you can't even tell there's a screen protector on. Seriously I'm amazed. If you use a case which covers the sides (I use the Seido Active, which is awesome btw), like most do, then it's literally nonexistant. The only thing that would give it away is the texture. Now calm down, it's not that bad, no rough or ripply feel, but it seems to catch your finger easier than the screen. You know how occasionally if you're finger was wet and you dried your hands and tried to use your phone, it can be kind of..."sticky?" As in it's tougher to slide than usual, not actually sticky. Well there's some of that, but not every time, just seems to be a bit more sensitive to it. Hardly a deal breaker though.Only other issue is I guess I used too much pressure when getting rid of some bubbles. In the bottom left corner, closer to the home button than I'd like, there are a few tiny, near transparent scratches that I can't get rid of. They are maybe 2 mm long each and are definitely only noticeable if you look...but I can't stop looking. I'm hoping I'll get over it and forget and life will go on. It's really not that bad, but it does keep me from giving a perfect 5 stars.Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this product. It's biggest advantage IMO is the ability to use a case with it. I liked the Tech and Armor Shield and all of those, but apparently they cover the WHOLE screen, meaning if you try to use a case, it'll pull the edges up. I have to use a case, so this is perfect. I feel like I could conquer the world now with my secure S3. It really is amazing how I can't tell it's on there at all. And a final, added bonus, is I also got 4 instead of the advertised 3, as well as an e-mail explaining this is because they understand it can be tricky to apply, so they gave an extra. Very cool.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008Y179IS" id="B008Y179IS-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-14:</strong> I knew the screen protector did not cover the entire face of the phone when I purchased it. I read the explanation from the seller that the space around the protector will typically get covered by cases. My case does not cover the unprotected areas. I would not purchase this product again but I will continue to use it since I've already purchased it. The screen protector is clear and great for viewing. I thought it was a challenge to get on without bubbles.

The screen protector does not eliminate finger prints or streaking, however it does resist scratches and glares.

I was nervous to try another, but just today I applied this brand to my phone (in the bathroom with hot water running to keep the lint down)and it looks just as good as the realook brand for my original Galaxy S.

I went through a few different brands of screen protectors for my cellular phones. Once I used iSmooth brand, I knew I had overpaid for all past purchases. iSmooth is very easy to apply and very easy to reapply if a placement mistake had been made. They come with tabs to use if there is any dust under the protector and those are very easy to use as well. I have purchased these as gifts and they have been very well received. You usually get what you pay for but these exceeded my expectations. They are very durable and they last a long time. They have only failed me because of user error. Learn from the mistake and apply it correctly and they work very well. I would recommend to anyone with a need for a screen protector.

This is going to catch on everything, my pocket, my fingers/nails, etc. It will lift up more and more every day, it will collect lint, it will lose stickyness further and further into the protector and will come off. I have a company phone account for 250 phones and I apply all the screen protectors, never seen one this bad and that says a lot I think. Very disapointed. There's got to be a better S3 screen protector.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008Y179IS" id="B008Y179IS-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-21:</strong> Decided to add one of these to my GS3 even though its glass is very tough.

I am on my last one now and I will be ordering another package of them.  You can see the scratches it saves your phone.  The curve on the outside of the screen is accounted for and it fits perfectly if you measure correctly.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008Y179IS" id="B008Y179IS-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-25:</strong> I've used a number of screen protectors, and this one is by far the best I've seen.INSTRUCTIONS -------For bubble-free application, you'll need a shower/bathroom, blue painter's tape, and the stuff that comes in this package.1) Start up the shower to get the bathroom super steamy. Ideally, just shower and then perform these steps afterwards. The steam removes dust from the air but shouldn't damage your precious phone.2) Clean the screen completely using the microfiber cloth from the package.3) Remove one screen protector from the package and place it on top of the screen as though you're installing it. (DO NOT remove any of the layers yet.)4) Once you've placed it exactly where you want it to go, carefully place a long strip of blue tape along ONE LONG EDGE of the phone, overlapping one edge of the protector. This should create a kind of hinge with the screen protector. Video: [...]5) Lift up the screen protector from the untaped free edge and gently blow over the screen to remove any traces of dust.6) CAREFULLY peel off the bottom layer of the screen protector (the face that will touch the screen). DO NOT touch the exposed sticky surface.7) Starting at one corner, start to lay the protector down, using the squeegee (included) to flatten it. Do this slowly and methodically by creating a slight bend in the protector and using the squeegee to sweep across where the bend touches the screen.8) Once the protector is fully placed, use the squeegee to push any bubbles toward the edge. If you see any dust, you either need to start again or you need to use some scotch tape to remove the dust.9) Remove the blue tape.10) Remove the top layer of the screen protector. DONE!PROS -------* Customer service is great. The seller communicated quickly and even threw in an extra protector!* The protector fits perfectly on my AT&T; Galaxy S3. It covers the screen with a clearance of about 2-3mm of space from the phone edge. This is desirable because it reduces the amount of grit that'll get under the edges.* No bubbles! Follow the instructions above and you'll see this comes out flawless.* The surface is extremely smooth; it's indistinguishable from naked glass. A lot of people complain about traditional protectors because of the tactile feel, but this is smooth and perfect.* Minimal aberration/darkening. The screen is very bright and you can only see a bit of thin-film diffraction in specific lighting (colorful patterns) when the screen is off.* It sticks on but isn't tacky. I bet you can remove and re-stick this multiple times. This also means that dirt doesn't really get trapped under it.CONS -------* Doesn't reduce glare. If you want something that does, go for a protector with a matte finish.* Fingerprint magnet. Get a cleaning cloth.* On mine, some of the edges aren't quite flush. Not a big deal.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008Y179IS" id="B008Y179IS-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-14:</strong> I think that the iSmooth name screen protectors are great!  got them for my Galaxy Note 2 as well, and absolutely love them!  just do yourself a favor and be sure to apply in a dust free environment!

I'm not new to screen protectors, I pretty much put one on every electronic device I own. Installation itself was fine, though it didn't adhere well to the screen and kept on coming off when I pulled off the front 'tab'.The problem is that the screen protector has an odd rainbow effect in a zigzag pattern. It's very noticeable with the screen off(it looks oily almost), but is still slightly noticeable when on as well. I did clean the screen again and tried another one, but still the same thing. A few weeks later my sis(who owns this phone) told me the bottom is already peeling off. All in all, this is a poor quality product and I do not recommend it.I was thinking of buying a SPIGEN which I've had good experiences with, specifically my S2, but was lured by the good reviews of this one(and the SPIGEN one is more expensive). Unfortunately, I got what I paid for.EDIT: Actually, looking around, I see this problem has been reported repeatedly very recently and Smooth Global said it was a manufacturer defect. Maybe they just have a bad batch altogether. If so, I hope they get on fixing that so others won't have the same problem. I'll be moving onto a different brand, however.Update: Went with the "SPIGEN SGP Samsung Galaxy S3 Steinheil Ultra Nano CLEAR 3-PACK Screen Protector Cover", perfect as always and what I would expect from the brand, go with that. Can't even tell it's on the screen and adhered perfectly.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008Y179IS" id="B008Y179IS-review21" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-12:</strong> I used to buy all my screen protectors from a company that sounds like &#34;Sagg&#34; lol until I found iSmooth.

Also, the installation goes pretty smoothly if you follow directions and know what you're doing.  I've had lots of experience putting on screen protectors over the years the application went very easy for me.  I do appreciate the dust particle removal stickers that are included in case you make a minor mistake and some dust gets on the screen protector's sticky side during the application process.The two reasons I gave this product 3 stars is because of the fit and the visual effects from finger smudges.  The screen does not fit the bottom of the screen very well.  I have Seidio's hard case on by S3 and the iSmooth leaves 1/8th of an inch of the phone uncovered on the bottom.  It's extra awkward because the edge of the protector ends on the back and menu touch buttons on the phone.  It would be much better if the protector was a little longer near the bottom.  The second issue is that the iSmooth is easily smudged by the oils from your fingers.  Once smudged, the protector gives off a rainbow streak and causes the screen to be blurry.  Granted, this is not an anti-matte screen, but I've had over non-anti-matte protectors from other brands and they did not smudge so easily.Bottom line, I'm buying another set of protectors from a different brand.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B008Y179IS', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B008Y179IS', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00GNJ4120</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00GNJ4120</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

It is pretty protective, and it has protected my phone from a couple of drops. I actually let my friend use it twice and he tossed it about four feet in the air onto very hard carpet and onto the hard floor on a bus. Both times it came out unscathed. I definitely do not think it protects very well though. I do not think it could protect my phone for anything above 4 feet.I would definitely go for the IonicIonic GUARDIAN Armor Case for LG Google Nexus 4 (Black)or the BallisticBallistic SG1098-M005 AGF SG Series Case for LG E960/NEXUS 4 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Blackcase instead (I just ordered the Ballistic).The grips on the case are not very grippy at all. The 'grippy' part actually seems more slippery in my hands than the non-textured areas. So do not expect to get much more traction on your Nexus 4 with this case.Also, It pulled up my screen protector a lot. I actually ripped it off and cut off the edges a couple of millimetres all around the protector and they cooperate better.Overall, I could not recommend this product because of it's lack of true protection found in the Ballistic and Ionic cases (with three layers and two layer, respectively). Spend a couple more dollars and get an upgrade.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000I8FXYW" id="B000I8FXYW-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-15:</strong> nice fit and slimmer than most other cases. does provide a bit of protection to face-on falls and to corners.

Although it was more ease to press the volume buttons, i had to apply more pressure against the power button. Maybe it is a mistake in creating. With about a week, i kind of got used to it, so it did not bother me much to always notice it. Because of the somewhat slippery back, it sorta makes the hold slippery. While i am speaking of the back, the back makes the phone looks awesome. It is transparent and i can clearly read 'nexus' & 'LG' from the back. it gives the phone a good look. The grip, is not a severe issue, but the level of grip is just less than my other case by GreatShield. I just want to put that out there for other consumers to consider. Another thing i'll add is that it looks pretty cool in sunlight. I can see part of the actual phone through the case while the sunlight makes mostly the edges of the case glisten. To conclude, i will be sticking with this case because of the look, protection, and decent grip.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000I8FXYW" id="B000I8FXYW-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-24:</strong> This case plain and simple is ok.

My wife bought this cover for her phone. She has been home after a surgery and has not left the house for the complete time she has had this cover or the phone for that matter. She is also very carful with her things. So I have to pay for shipping to have this shipped back for a refund. It isn't worth the money to return it so I'm up and out. This is why internet shopping sucks. I guess that is why it doesn't pay to buy cheap crap.I thought I would update the review. Amazon is being good and offering to pay for the expense of this but I'm not going to mess with it. It isn't worth the hassle. But I'm impressed by Amazon offering to help out this way.

We've tried those as well - stick with Incipio.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005Y0J1Z6" id="B005Y0J1Z6-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-14:</strong> it was more worth it to just keep then return!i do not like this at all!!its FAT!the back always opens (meaning you could loose some very personal things credit card/license etc.!) think about it..will NOT recommend it to anyone!!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005Y0J1Z6" id="B005Y0J1Z6-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-27:</strong> Got this for the Dragon Lady so she doesn't have to lug a purse on short errands or her usual Shoe Store adventures.SHE LOVES IT!!!

When the screen isn't lit, I can see a film which I have never noticed on any other protector. So although this protects my screen, was relatively easy to install and fits my screen exactly (even custom cut for the front camera), I can't recommend it because I'm sure that most other protectors available do not have a noticable film when the screen is off. Also note this has been on my phone for about 6 weeks now and I've cleaned my screen countless times, the film is still there, so it's certainly permanent.

Both are great, fairly easy to get on the phone and fit perfectly.  This clear one is virtually invisible except around the edges and really lets the screen shine through.  The one flaw I found with the matte version was that it dulled the screen a little too much.  The flaw with this clear version is fingerprint collection. This thing is cover in finger smudges every time I pick it up.  Other than that, it's solid.  I've had it on my phone for 2 months now and have not picked up any scratches or marks from keys or anything.

I will not purchase another seidio active case for my next phone.  Spend the money, get the otterbox commuter instead.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007PPYXMY" id="B007PPYXMY-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-20:</strong> This is the second Seidio case I've had. I had the surface combo for my Incredible, after trying a number of others.Edit 6/15/12 - I've decided I hate the kickstand, and have subtracted two stars for it. It is hard to see from any pictures I've seen just how far it sticks out, nor how much weight it adds (it is made from what seems like pretty stout metal, and has three magnets hold it closed). This phone by itself is slightly wedge shaped, getting thicker at the top. The kickstand sticks out far enough to negate that difference and then some- to the point that the phone doesn't sit flat. The fact that it is metal makes me worry about scratched furniture. It only works in landscape mode, too. But top it off with what appears to be a design flaw in the kickstand packaging, and I am now regretting my purchase. The flaw is that the harder plastic outer cover must flex a bit to fit over the inner soft rubber cover. There is a thin piece of ABS (assumed) glued over where the metal part of the kickstand mounts from the inner surface of the back cover. The glue joint breaks when the outer cover flexes when mounting and removing it from the phone. Mine has come far enough loose that the metal kickstand now just falls out. This is after only a month or so of use. I've emailed Seidio about these concerns, and may seek a warranty replacement.I'd probably subtract another star given these complaints, but I would still recommend the case. Some might find the kickstand less bothersome, and I think it is still a well made case. It is a shame this case isn't sold without the kickstand for this model phone. 99% of the time, I have no use for it.But in the end, my expectations were quite high given my positive experience I had with the Surface Combo on my HTC Incredible. In hind sight, I probably should have gone with that model case again.Original review:When I ordered my Razr Maxx, I knew I wanted another Seidio case, but I was torn between the Active and the Surface. The Surface is essentially a two piece molded ABS case. It is very thin and adds very little thickness or weight, but adds lots of protection. Seidio shows great attention to detail in the molding of their cases so that they fit every curve of your phone perfectly. The Active is a two layer deal with a resilient silicone rubber type inner sleeve and an outer molded ABS exoskeleton which leaves some of the rubber exposed on the sides for grip. It is a very slick design, which is only a little bit thicker than the Surface. It adds only a few grams extra weight, and is WAY less bulky than other two-layer cases, especially the Otter Box Defender. It doesn't have a front screen cover or any port and camera plugs, so it doesn't add water proofing. But it does add impressive protection. I decided to go with the Active because the Razr Maxx is still so thin that a little extra thickness would actually help it sit in the hand better. The Active case also has a kick stand, which is a cool feature, but it protrudes a little. I wish it could be  flush, but it hasn't been an issue. The volume and power buttons are covered, but rubber buttons which sit on top of them are molded in, and as a bonus, makes them much easier to find and press. On the phone itself, the buttons are hard to locate by touch.I purchased the holster combo. For me, the holster is one of the best features of Seidio's cases. The belt clip is very stout, and the way the phone is held display-in and fully protected is awesome. The display is actually held a few milometers from the holster back, so nothing is actually touching the display. A spring loaded clip at the top holds the phone very securely and is very easy to operate one-handed. There is no better case where this function is concerned.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007PPYXMY" id="B007PPYXMY-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-12:</strong> For clarification: I purchased this case in the combo package with the matching holster in the black color. That is why it doesn't show this review as an Amazon verified purchase. I thought it would be best to post my review here as well since this is identical to my purchase but the inclusion of the holster.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~My husband and I both have a Droid Razr Maxx. His was purchased October 2, 2012 and mine was purchased March 21, 2013.We originally purchased twoOtterbox Commuter Case for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Blackas I had an Otterbox on my previous phone (a Droid Incredible 2) and loved it. The silicone flaps covering the access ports on the Otterbox Razr Maxx cases were nothing short of a disappointment. They never seated correctly and were always coming loose and flapping around allowing dust and particles into the ports. One of the reasons for purchasing the Otterbox cases was because it had these port covers. Since those failed to perform correctly these cases were removed from our phones and they have been naked and without protection for about a week now.After extensive research of countless cases and reviews here on Amazon, I purchased this case along with three others in a desperate attempt to find the right case for our Droid Razr Maxx phones, once and for all. The cases purchased and compared were:Asmyna MOTXT912MHPCSO006NP Premium Durable Protective Case for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX XT912 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - BlackTrident Case AG-XT912-BK AEGIS Case for Motorola Droid Razr MAXX (XT912) - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - BlackSeidio BD2-HR3MTRM-BK SURFACE Case and Holster Combo for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - BlackSeidio BD2-HK3MTRMK-BK ACTIVE Combo with Metal Kickstand for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Black~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~First, the Asmyna:Pros:-It is easy to 'install'.-The front and back pieces audibly snap together and seems to hold firm.-It feels good in the hand, being somewhat slick and glossy.-Does not add bulk to an already sizable phone.Cons:-It does not line up properly with the camera, flash, speaker or noise-cancelling speaker on the back of the phone.-It is too slick, causing it to slide off of just about any surface.-It is extremely prone to fingerprints.-All ports are openly exposed to the elements (dust and particle collection, moisture, etc.)Bottom line:I would not recommend this case as, for me, its cons outweigh its pros. I also cannot attest to this product's ability to protect a phone from a drop as I did not feel confident that it would stay on the phone upon any kind of impact. So I chose not to submit my $600 phone to what I deemed an imminent death. This case will be returned.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Next, the Trident Aegis:Pros:-Sturdy, two part design.-Everything lined up beautifully on my Razr Maxx.-Install was a breeze, with only a little encouraging to get the inner silicone liner to set inside the lip of the outer hard shell casing.-The outer hard shell has two built-in mesh-like dust covers that go over the rear speaker and the noise-cancelling speaker when installed on the phone.-The design on the back of the inside silicone liner pokes through the back of the outer hard shell and slightly raises the phone off any surface it is laying on, thus making the speaker sound un-muffled. This is a difficult feature to find in cases these days (why manufacturers don't just place the speaker on the front of the phone for this very reason, is beyond me).-All ports are covered by silicone flaps.-Accessibility to the MicroSD and Sim cards without case removal.-Power and volume buttons are covered and operate as if there was no case on the phone.-When laying face down, the outer rim of the case provides protection to the touch screen by slightly raising it off of any surface it is placed on.-Adds bulk, but not as much as the Otterbox Commuter case.Cons:-There are two locations (along the edge of the MicroSD and Sim card protection flap and along the front, top, center of the phone - directly above 'Motorola') on the silicone liner where the silicone is in extremely thin strips. I do not see these holding up very long as I can see these ripping or tearing after sufficient use.-The protective flaps are flimsy and do not set into place very well (with the exception of the headphone jack cover, which seats almost too well).Bottom line:Even though I have listed more pros than cons, I will not be keeping this case. To me, a cell phone case should be something that you can easily install (and remove if necessary) and not be something that you have to continuously battle to stay in place on your phone. Although it is not a deal breaker for me if a phone has protective flaps over access ports or not - it does matter to me that if a case does have these that they set in place properly and not flap around freely. I also am fearful of the longevity of this case given the thinness of the inner silicone liner. For these reasons, I believe I will be returning this Trident Aegis case.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Next, the Seidio Surface (Case and Holster Combo):Pros:-Lined up well with the camera, flash, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and all buttons.-Does not add any noticeable bulk.-Exterior surface is has a soft-to-the-touch feeling while remaining hard.-Includes a holster.-MicroSD/Sim card access door area of the case is solid. (This may be a con to others, but I prefer this be solid as I rarely ever need to access my SD or Sim cards.)Cons:-No silicone components making it very slick.-Easy to put on the phone, but be prepared for an all out battle to remove it. I spent close to fifteen minutes fighting this thing, trying to coerce it off of my phone. Due to its lack of any silicone, I could not get a good grip on the case and had to turn my phone off as I kept pressing the power and volume buttons in my all out brawl.-All ports are exposed (except the MicroSD and Sim card access door, see Pros list above).Bottom line:This case is laughable. It is the only case in my many years of cell phone ownership to cause me so much frustration upon trying to remove it from my phone. The scenario I found myself in while trying to remove the case was very similar to trying to get out of a Chinese finger trap - pretty much every movement makes things worse. I prefer a case to fit snugly, as those offer the best protection because they will not slip or slide on the phone. But this Seidio Surface case, wow.. needless to say, despite the pros I listed for it, this case will be returned.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~And, finally, the Seidio Active (Case and Holster Combo):Pros:-Does not add much bulk (as compared to the Otterbox Commuter)-Well thought out and functional two part design-Feels good in the hand-Easy to operate while holding in one hand (not too heavy)-Silicone along the edges makes is very easy to grip and keep your grip. This case will rarely slip from your grasp.-All ports and the camera, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and buttons line up perfectly.-Power and volume buttons respond with the same (if not better!) sensitivity as if there was no case on the phone.-The MicroSD and Sim card access door is completely blocked (again, I know some others may prefer to have access to this door, but this is a preference of mine as I hardly ever need to remove/replace these cards).-The kickstand is a fun addition - is functional and seems as though it would last quite awhile as long as you were gentle when pulling it from its seated magnetic position.-Includes a belt holster which fits the phone w/case perfectly.-The phone w/case can be seated in the included holster either facing in or out.Cons:-The addition of the kickstand on the back causes the phone to tilt toward the top - this muffles the rear speaker.-With so much silicone exposed on the sides of the phone, I can see the potential for these areas being dust magnets.-The top ports (HDMI, Power and headphone jack) are left openly exposed. Although this is not a deal breaker for me, it may be for others. (NOTE: Because the phone can be inserted into the holster either faced in or out, the holster's clip partially covers the top ports, offering some protection. Not much, but thought I would mention it.)-The retention clip on the holster appears to have a disadvantage because of its design - due to the curve and the distance the clip extends from the phone, I can see this potentially catching on things (seat belts, couches, chairs, etc.) and either breaking the clip entirely, rendering the holster useless and requiring a replacement be purchased OR dislodging the phone from the holster allowing it to fall to the ground.Bottom line:I believe I finally found the case I have been searching for - the Seidio Active. My husband also chose this case of the four we received and I have reviewed here. So, I guess that means I need to purchase another one for myself. The black is exactly what my husband wanted, but I prefer a color that stands out more.. so I suppose I will be buying the red or blue. Once I receive that case, I will update my review to report on the clarity of the color as opposed to the color depicted here online.Thank you for reading. I hope my search helps someone else find the perfect case for them too (as well as saving them the time of conducting the research!).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007PPYXMY" id="B007PPYXMY-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-30:</strong> I had an OB on my DROID2 and I didn't care for it too much. It just made a bulky phone even bukier.When I ordered my RAZR MAXX, I was looking for something that woulg give me decent protection without all the added bulk.I looked at theDiztronic Matte Back Smoke Flexible TPU Case for Motorola Droid Razr Maxx [ONLY FOR MAXX VERSION] (Verizon & Rogers) [Diztronic Retail Packaging] and this is easily the thinnest base layer of protection out there. Unfortunately, there is not much "cushioning" offered by the TPU case. The TPU case will likely keep the MAXX free from scratches to the body of the phone. The TPU is very grippy - a really nice feel to it.I also tried aTrident Case AMS-XT912-BK Kraken AMS Case for Motorola Droid Razr MAXX (XT912) with Holster Bundle - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Blackand this case was ridiculously HUGE. I would say it easily offers a great deal of protection (even includes a screen protector) but it doubles to triples the weight and thickness of the phone and it it seriously obnoxious looking. While I could just use the silicone portion of the Kraken, it seemed like a waste of money, so I returned it.I finally looked into Seidio and found the ACTIVE case. It seemed like it fit the bill, so I gave it a shot. I like it's "cushioning" ability and the small amount of rigidity given by the ABS plastic "skeleton." However, the big drawback of theSeidio CSK3MTRMK-BK ACTIVE with Metal Kickstand for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Blackis that, in the hand, it isn't very grippy. I would say it is more slippy than it is grippy.I have pretty big hands & holding the naked RAZR MAXX, it wasn't an issue for me, nor is it an issue with the added dimensions of a small case.I got aTrident AG-R680-RD Aegis Case with Screen Protector Kit for Samsung SCH-R680 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Redfor my Samsung Repp and I love it. More grippy than the Seidio and the skeleton is even more rigid. Thankfully, the Aegis case is nowhere near as bulky as the Kraken. I feel the Aegis offers a higher level of protection without inhibiting any functions. Buttons are more responsive on the Aegis than the ACTIVE.I will keep the active as a backup (plus I love the kickstand) but the overall feel of the Aegis is superior, as is the protection (includes a screen protector). If you decide to give the ACTIVE case a try, Make sure you get a good screen protector too. TheFosmon Crystal Clear Screen Protector Shield for Motorola Droid Razr (XT910) / Droid Razr MAXX (XT912) - 3 Packpairs so well with the ACTIVE case, they seem as if they were made for one another. The Screen Protectors are totally transparent and offer good feel as well.Nothing is as grippy as the TPU case, but the Aegis a really good combination. If it had a kickstand, like the ACTIVE, it would be even better. Oh, well...nothing is perfect!Hope this helps!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B007PPYXMY', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B007PPYXMY', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00CGAMBB8</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00CGAMBB8</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

The instructions that come with the battery are clear about the method of conditioning the battery, I've followed them to the letter. The instructions are to not charge the battery when you receive it but instead to put it in and let the battery drain to 0 and then charge it using the wall charger. For the next four charge cycles you should let the battery drain to 0 before recharging it.The only down side of this battery, and all of the Quasimodo class batteries, is the hump on the back of the GN. Holding the phone is definitely not as comfortable as it was with the standard battery but it's tolerable. My only other complaint is that no one sells a compatible soft skin for hunchbacked GNs. Sendio has a two piece polycarbonate case but I'm not interested in that, I prefer a soft rubbery skin. Hopefully someone will come out with one soon now that there are couple of big batteries available for the GN.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007EZ2PU2" id="B007EZ2PU2-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-07:</strong> The battery did not work.

I've had one in the past that was so ugly and huge it completely changed the phone.  So I was pleasantly surprised when I popped in this new battery and cover.  First off, the battery itself is about twice the width of the standard battery.  So there is some obvious weight increase.  However, not as much as I feared.  For a battery that has 300% capacity of the standard and to only be 200% larger, is a nice surprise.The cover is just as surprising.  I expected some matte black cover that would not match the rest of the phone.  Again I was nicely surprised.  It has the same textured look and feel as the previous cover.  In addition, it snaps right onto the phone just as the original.So what does this do to the appearance of your phone?  Well, it is certainly thicker.  I really liked the original thinness but found it to be a bit slick in my hand and had several scary incidents of it nearly slipping out of my hand while trying to use some of the software or buttons.  This aspect is now completely gone.  The weight is at the bottom of the phone and the extra thickness makes for a nice grip.The most important aspect is the capacity of the battery.  I have been following the directions which calls for the battery to be 'conditioned' the first few times it is used.  This means allowing it to drain all the way down and then charging it up completely.  After a few cycles of charge / discharge, the battery is ready for standard use.My old battery would last only a few hours a day.  We have great 4G / LTE in our area so it is always on and draining the battery.  I got where I would leave it on the charger at night and all day at work.  Still I would see significant draining in the few hours off the charger to less than 50%.  With this new battery... wow, I am able to get almost two complete days between charging.  This is huge for me as I am a big user of data on this phone and couldn't always be around an outlet.  I'm very, very pleased with this purchase.  $20 turned my $300 phone into an all-day tool.Pros:o cover matches texture, look, and feel of originalo extra mass makes phone easier to gripo fantastic capacityCons:o does make phone thicker - but that's the only way it can get more capacityOverall - I highly recommend this battery and cover.  Makes your investment in your high-tech Samsung phone live up to its potential.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007EZ2PU2" id="B007EZ2PU2-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-05:</strong> I've been using the Trexcell Extended 3800mah NFC Compliant Battery and cover since Mar 2012.  As everyone using the Samsung Galaxy Nexus Prime knows, the battery life is abysmal; the standard battery was only good for around 4 hours and a lot less if I used it for more than a little texting and talking.  I work in the field 10 to 14 hours a day and it's important that I have reliable communication so, I decided to try this battery and it doubled the life of my phones standard battery.  I usually get between 6 to 12 hours out of the phone now with normal usage which is at least acceptable.Pros:Doubles the battery capacityCons:Cannot get a protective case that fits the extended batteryMakes the phone thicker if you need to make a fashion statement (doesn't matter to me).  Just wish they would make the batteries large enough to last at least 14 hours 3800 to 5000mah.  And then have an option for a thinner phone with no battery life for people who are usually near power rather than the other way around.Had a problem with the battery draining in an hour or so, found out that a newly installed app was accessing the GPS and killing the phone so I killed the app.  Watch for this, a lot of apps and web sites will access the GPS and kill the battery quickly.  Not to mention using the camera will kill it fast as well.  The phone companies really aren't thinking when they put so many capabilities into a phone and then place an 1800mah battery as the only power source.Final thoughts; it's worth it buy it!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007EZ2PU2" id="B007EZ2PU2-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-21:</strong> Like my title says, I bought this hoping to save $50 over the Seido extended battery.

I was wrong. I followed the "conditioning" procedures so that I would get the maximum battery life. For the first day or so, I THOUGHT I saw an increase in battery life. I was getting really frustrated after a few days, and upon "normal" use, it still had almost no battery at the end of the day. Like one reviewer said, "Not much better than the stock battery."I am not someone who spends a lot of time talking on the phone or web browsing. I am with clients most of the day, so I take and return phone calls, in between clients, have a wi-fi connection (or a data connection if I am not within wi-fi range) for my online scheduling to update in real-time, and sometimes I check my email and/or text messages. I typically start my day at 6 AM and go until 10 PM. When your phone dies at 6 PM, with mild to moderate use, and you still have 4 hours left of your day, that is not good. I realized that it is possible that I had a defective battery and contacted Trexcell customer service. No response. I said "screw it" and bought the more expensive Seidio.MUCH BETTER! I guess you get what you pay for. With the Seidio battery, on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus (VZW phone,) I sometimes can go 2 full days, plus, without plugging it in. There have been a few times I had to actually turn on the data, plus wi-fi and do some serious web browsing just to drain the battery completely, after almost two days of not plugging it in. Of course, if I use GPS, or do an unusual amount of web browsing, I have to plug it in at the end of the day...but it usually still has juice, so I am getting 16-20+ hours on this one. The Trexcell, barely 8-10 hours, on a light day of use.PLUS, what is up with NO RESPONSE regarding the possibly defective battery?  I have to assume that isn't defective, but instead just the poorer quality of this battery.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007EZ2PU2" id="B007EZ2PU2-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-27:</strong> Received product(s) in good condition.

I did not promise them a good review and they did not ask for one in exchange.This iFLASH may be small but, at 4400 mAh it carries enough juice to fully power up an iPhone 5 (1,440 mAh) at least twice or a Galaxy S III (2,100 mAh) once with some left to spare - keep in mind that the energy transfer is not 100% efficient so don't expect three iPhone 5 charges. Small size and simplicity is what makes this model different and it can be your favorite battery pack for as long as your phone charges through a Micro USB port (or you can supply your own wire) and you supply your own wall charger.It does come with some essential accessories: a charging cable that can be used to both charge your phone and charge it and a nice bluish nylon mesh bag to hold the iFLASH and the USB wire. Besides its ability to charge a phone once you plug it in - and do NOT attempt to use it with anything larger such as a tablet - the only other features include a blue-LEDs charge meter that activates once you press the one white button once and a one-LED flashlight capability that turns itself on or off if you double-tap the white button.I am very found of this model and can't think of any negatives other than the shiny black finish being a fingerprint magnet but I don't know anyone who would spend much time staring at a battery pack. So five stars it is.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DHEHC3E" id="B00DHEHC3E-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-25:</strong> Power Bank Evaluation - iFlash 4400 Power Bank (Black)This is intended as a cell phone charger - not a tablet charger, since it only charges at 1 AmpmAh - 4400#and Amps of Charging ports - 1 Charging port, only 1 Amp (Instructions state that it is intended for digital communication devices requiring a DC5V input).

Overall, this battery pack performed very well based on the test described below.I received this power bank from the manufacturer for an honest review be it positive or negative. Top reviewers are often asked to review new battery packs and one of the benefits of being asked to test different power banks is that it gives me an opportunity to compare them to each other using the same charging test, so I can compare them using "apples to apples" comparison. This set of tests allows me to provide unbiased results as the numbers speak for the performance of each unit.My methodology is to charge each mobile device on each port of the unit for 10 minutes and measuring how much each unit was charge in that 10 minute period. In addition I tested charging two mobile devices at the same time. Each line in the table below represents a separate 10 minute test.I use Battery App by Elvison to determine how each device recognized the charging source. 'AC' status means the charging is at full charging rate. 'USB' status indicates charging at a lower charging rate. 'Discharging' status means that the charging rate is below the power that the device is consuming so it slows down the discharge rate but does not re-charge.&#10152; General features:======================iFlash 4400mAh external battery weighs 4.1 oz. Its size is 2" x 4" x 7/8".  It has nice rounded edges and feels nice in your hand.  My husband, who is normally oblivious to such things, said "Oh, it is a cute one!"  It comes in both black and white colors, and the manufacturer of this battery send me both.  This gave me a chance to test both and compare their performance. Ideally, one wants to see identical performance from both units as it would speak to a good quality control at the factory. And this is exactly what I saw testing these two units with my 4 mobile devices.This external battery  has 1 USB output port.  The package includes 21" USB to micro USB cable and a carrying pouch. Galaxy tab connector and lightening cable for iPad Mini are not included.  The battery pack a small LED flash light built into it. The flash light is not very bright, but I found it handy to use in the car while driving at night without creating too much glare for the driver.&#10152; Test Results:======================&#10004; Samsung Galaxy 7.7 tablet (using my own Galaxy tab connector cable)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~White unit: AC ~~~~~~ 2% change in charge in 10 minutesBlack unit: AC ~~~~~~ 2% change in charge in 10 minutes&#10004; Nexus 7 Tab~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Black unit: AC ~~~~~~ 2% change in charge in 10 minutesWhite unit: AC ~~~~~~ 2% change in charge in 10 minutes&#10004; Galaxy Nexus Phone~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Black unit: AC ~~~~~~ 6% change in charge in 10 minutesWhite unit: AC ~~~~~~ 6% change in charge in 10 minutes&#10004; iPad Mini~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Black unit: AC ~~~~~~ 1% change in charge in 10 minutesWhite unit: AC ~~~~~~ 1% change in charge in 10 minutes&#10152; Key finding:======================&#10004; This external battery worked very consistently in both units I have tested for all 4 devices I have tested.  It did a very nice job charging the phone. It is not the fastest external battery I have tested for charging the tablets, but it has a very convenient size and makes a good travel companion.

However, while it is narrow (a bit under 2 inches wide) it is rather thick (about 3/4 inch thick). It's about 4 inches long.The USB output port is on the top next to a pretty bright LED flashlight. The input port for charging the powerbank is on the side. All ports are solidly built and well-anchored into the body of the powerbank.It has a "gas gauge" indicator to display the charge level left in the powerbank, and a nicely done round power switch to turn it on for charging and to use the flashlight.It comes with a decent cloth storage bag and a USB cable. It does not include an AC adapter or adapters for phones that don't use a standard micro USB port.I only have one complaint - the glossy case is a fingerprint magnet. Looks nice when it's clean, but it's nearly impossible to keep it looking glossy. It doesn't interfere at all with functionality, but if you're bugged by seeing fingerprint smudges, this is probably not a good choice.But other than the fingerprint issue, it's a nicely done powerbank with ample power for a typical phone. Well worth considering.[sample provided for review]</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DHEHC3E" id="B00DHEHC3E-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-18:</strong> I am so dependent on my iPhone that I cringe when I see the battery depleting with no options in the near future to recharge, and that's why I never travel without an external battery.  I own several of them with varying amounts of power for exactly this reason.  This iFlash 4400mAh carries the least charge, but it is also the least expensive, making it an attractive option for anyone who rarely needs to recharge but who wants the security of having extra power nearby.  The construction is solid and smooth.  I can't believe I'm saying this about a battery, but . . . I love the way it feels in my hand because of its rounded, glossy case.I can get about 1.5 charges for my iPhone 5 out of this.  The amount of charge will increase slightly after you charge and drain it a few times, but the capacity/power transfer is too small for more power-hungry devices such as the iPad.  For those kinds of devices, you would be better off with an 8400mAh external battery, although the trade-off is a larger, heavier power source.  This iFlash is sized perfectly to stash in a handbag or briefcase.This iFlash battery comes with nothing more than a blue mesh pouch for storage and a USB charging cable. You will have to supply your own device-specific USB cable to charge your device since the package doesn't contain any adapters.  If you want to charge the battery via wall outlet, you'll also have to supply your own USB outlet adapter.  You may want to get an extra but short smart phone cable to keep in the pouch; otherwise, you may find yourself in need of a charge without the ability to do it.  Charging the battery takes a few hours and can be done at home.  I do my charging overnight, although it takes much less time than that.  But charging my phone takes just a little more time than it would plugged into a wall.  My iPhone 5 went from 14% to full charge in about an hour and a half.Because of the price, this external battery would make a great stocking stuffer, particularly for teenagers and college students.  This black version (there's a white-and-blue one, too) is a fingerprint magnet; however, the sleek look and feel is more important to me.

I've since tried out several of them and have come to appreciate how well they perform.  They are right up there with the best of them and I've discovered that they are quite impressive in the power department.  This particular battery pack is more user-friendly, especially if you only want to have a battery pack on hand to power up your iPhone or iPod.  This unit also comes inwhite with blue trimif you prefer.There are several ways to charge the iFlash including through your PC, an AC wall charger, or even a car charger.  I usually charge this type of battery pack by plugging it into my PC and leaving it overnight.  You will of course, have to provide your own USB cables, which usually isn't a problem. This is a minimalist unit for those who don't want all the extras that sometimes come with the battery packs.When I test any battery pack I usually use my iPad to see how well it performs.  It's rather informal, but is quite telling.  Can this battery pack cut the mustard?iFLASH Performance:Start: 75% (4 LEDs)15 minutes  79%  (4 LEDs)30 minutes  83%45 minutes  87%  (3 LEDs)60 minutes  90%75 minutes  94%  (2 LEDs)90 minutes  97%115 minutes  100%The the performance was really impressive for a 4400mAh battery pack.  Mind you, I didn't sit on it watching it every second as it charged, but was quite surprised at how hard to work to try to get my iPad back up to snuff.  My iPad was 75% charged, but that last 25% can pull a lot of power from a battery pack.  If the 4400mAh iFlash can chug away powering up an iPad, no doubt it will keep your iPhone or iPod in business.This is a small, sleek unit and could easily be carried in a purse, knapsack, or briefcase. The top of the battery pack has the four blue LED indicators. Beneath that on the front side is the small LED flashlight, and one output port.  I suspect that LED flashlight would be able to stay on for more than 200 hours continuously given the power of this battery (just a guess). It's small, but would be great in emergency situations. On the right-hand side panel is the micro 5-pin input port.  The power switch is conveniently on the top face.WHAT'S IN THE BOX:~  Power Bank 4400mAh~  70 cm (27.55") Micro USB 5-pin Cable~  Quick start guide~  Blue mesh travel pouch with an iFLASH logo on a red tagSPECS:~ Weight: 4.1 ounces~ Input: Dc5V/1A~ Output:  Dc5V/1A~ Output: Charging speed for mobiles: 1000mAh/hours~ Input charging time: 5 - 6 hours~ Recycling time: > 500 times~ Six month limited warrantyPOWER INDICATORS:~ One LED light on: &lt;25%~ Two LED lights on: 25% - 50%~ Three LED lights on: 50% - 75%~ Four LED lights on: 75% - 100%Sample provided for review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DHEHC3E" id="B00DHEHC3E-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-13:</strong> This is my review on the iFlash 4400 external battery pack. The packaging is really nice, it comes in a nice box and is packaged very neatly inside. Included is the power bank itself, a small carrying bag and a standard micro USB cable that can equally be used on the power bank its self to replenish the batter on it. At 4400 mAh this external battery is of decent battery capacity and it is sure to provide enough power to charge most phones today about 2-3 times or more depending on the battery capacity of your phone. I tested this on (3) devices.* Apple iPad 3rd Generation* HTC EVO 3D w/extended battery* Kyocera HydroThe power bank functioned perfectly with all of these devices, although it isn't intended for most tablets due most tablets having a much larger battery capacity than this power bank, but it will provide some extra time on the device. As for the (2) phones that I tested this on It charged them multiple times without any problems at all.Durability seems pretty good, I have tested other power banks, some of them seem fragile; however, this one seems sturdy considering its lighter weight than others. The LED flashlight on this is pretty bright and it's a nice feature that they included in this. It makes the product more versatile and allows it to be used in more situations.Overall I really like the design and capabilities of this power bank, I am sure that you will enjoy it just as much as I did.I ultimately rate this product a perfect 5 stars out of 5 stars!I hope this review has helped you out!I was provided this product for testing & evaluation, my review of this product is completely honest & unbiased, the words stated above are my own.** Note since this has a 4400 mAh battery you might not want to recharge the power bank via a USB cable connected to a computer or a low output charger, I would advise seeking for and using a higher output charger such as one that has an output of 2.1 Amps or greater, this will ensure that the product doesn't take a substantial amount of time being charged. **</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DHEHC3E" id="B00DHEHC3E-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-10:</strong> The battery pack is very lightweight and stylish in design. It only weighs 4 ounces. It would fit nicely into a purse, pocket or briefcase. This small size is ideal for charging smart phones and for a student to toss into a backpack to boost their phone during a long day of use. It also comes with a cable and connectors that you need to make it more useful to charge your smart devices. You may need to use your original charging cables for some devices so take them with you if you need them. It has a USB port rated at 5 VDC at 1 Amp. It also contains a built in LED flashlight that makes it useful for travel, looking for your keys in a purse, a seat in a theater or in a dark unfamiliar hotel room at night.It is a good power resource to keep your USB recharged devices operating on those long work or school days or while you are traveling. It is ideal for charging a smart phone and its size makes it easy to carry. This battery uses Lithium Ion battery technology and carries a 4400 mAh capacity. I have included a video of the battery's features and I hope it is helpful to you.Many people like me are power users of their smart phones. If you are constantly using them then you know that they will run out of power sometime during the day or evening. If you are not near an AC wall outlet with your charger or in your car with a charger what can you do? It is especially important to have some way to recharge if you are traveling in a plane, in the middle of a school classroom or on a bus or train.When I test a battery I do an extensive set of tests that fully charges the battery and then I use it to charge devices and make sure that it is fully depleted when my tests are done. I time each test and document the results as the test progresses. I then calculate the mAh of capacity that the battery supplied and I then calculate its charging efficiency. This process takes from 3 hours to, in very large batteries, about a day for testing. I don't take any short cuts or guess and every battery has these tests performed on it and documented. This is to assure that the battery is tested and it performs well. If a battery has performed poorly I then run the tests again to verify the results.This battery pack is also available in a white color and here is the Amazon link:iFlash 4400mAh Backup External Battery Pack Charger with built-in Flashlight for iPhone 5, all iPhone, iPad, iPod models; Android Smartphones: Samsung Galaxy S3 S III I9300, Galaxy S2 S II I9100, Galaxy Nexus, Galaxy Note / HTC Sensation, One X, One S,...]What's in the box?* The iFlash 4400mAh battery pack* The battery pack comes with an instruction manual* The battery does not come with an AC wall charger.  Use the Micro USB charging tip for charging the battery.  You can use a computer USB 2.0 port to charge the battery pack but it is 4400 mAh and it will take a long time to charge (10 to 12 hours).  The manual states to use a 1 Amp USB wall charger and charging will take 5 to 6 hours.  I used a 2.1 Amp wall charger.* One charging cable for the battery pack or your smart devices. It is 28 inches long.* A carry bag to put the battery pack into.This is a good product and below I have listed its features and benefits as well as my test data for your review. Please take the time to quickly watch the video and if you have any questions send me a comment and I will try to help you.The iFlash 4400 mAh battery pack Features:* A 4400 mAh capacity specification* The unit is compact in size and weighs in at 4 ounces.* Attractively designed in a black plastic case.* There are 4 LEDs that indicate the battery's charged state and one LED means 0 to 25%, two LEDs means 25 to 50%, three LEDs means 50 to 75% and 4 LEDs means 75 to 100% of charged capacity.* This battery pack is nicely designed and easy to carry and it is ideal for smart phones for a quick charge after a long day at school or work.* There is one USB power output port. The USB port is rated at 5VDC at 1 Amps.* There is an ON button to allow you to check the existing charged battery capacity available. You must also press the on button to start the charging process of your device.* The battery uses Lithium Ion battery technology.* The battery pack can be recharged 500+ times* The battery pack contains a LED flashlight that can stay on for up to 200 hours on a fully charged battery.  You double press the on button to turn the flashlight on or off.* Warranty is 12 monthsTest charging an iPad  2 to measure the output capacity:Start iPad 2 at 35% and the battery pack at a full charge* The next morning the iPad 2 was at 88% and the battery pack was deadTest results summary:* Charging an iPad 2 from 35% to 88%* 53% x 6944 = 3680.32 mAh of charge taken from the battery.* 3680.32/4400 = 83.64% efficiency* This is an excellent result.Here are some of the mAh charging requirements for common devices:* iPhone 4 battery 1,420 mAh battery capacity* iPhone 4S battery 1,432 mAh battery capacity* iPad 2 battery 6,944 mAh battery capacity* iPad 3 battery 11,560 mAh battery capacity* Kindle Fire battery 4400 mAh capacity* Kindle Keyboard battery 1750 mAh capacity* iPhone 5 is 3.8 VDC at 5.45 Wh = 1434 mAh battery* iPad 4 battery is 11,486 mAh 3.7 VDC at 42.5 Wh* iPad Mini battery is 4490 mAh at 3.72 VDC 16.7 WhAs you can see the iFlash 4400mAh will not fully charge a totally dead iPad 2, 3 or 4 because it only contains 4400 mAh of capacity. You have to consider the losses in the charging circuits of both the battery pack and the device you are charging. Energy is lost during the voltage conversion, used by the electronics of the battery pack and your device and by the generation of heat.iFlash 4400 mAh battery pack device charging real world experience:* iPhone 4 or 5  approximately 2.59 full charges out of a fully charged battery pack.* iPad 2  approximately 53% of a full charge* iPad 3 or 4  approximately 31.8% of a full charge* iPad Mini  approximately 82% of a full charge* Kindle Fire  approximately 83.6% of a full charge* A normal estimated usable storage is 70% of capacity or .70 * 4400 mAh = 3080 mAh charging capacity available for your electronic devices.* In my testing I was able to use approximately 3680.32 mAh of capacity or roughly 83.64% of the 4400 mAh capacity. This is an excellent performance for this battery.This is a good product and deserves a 5 Star rating.I received a sample product for evaluation and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DHEHC3E" id="B00DHEHC3E-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-13:</strong> After opening the box it came in there where no instructions which was odd to me but the unit looked pretty straight forward to use.

When I pulled it out I liked it even less. Right away the glossy plastic seemed cheap. I slid a finger along the plastic part of the case and it immediately had slight scratches just from the roughness of my skin. I put my phone in it anyway and snapped the two plastic halves together. It clicked together and right away there seemed to be a solidness I did not expect. I wrapped the rubber casing around that and was immediately blown away at how less bulky it was than ANY other protective case I have owned. Very solid feeling also. This got 4 stars for it's surprising ruggedness and stylish looks. (I plan on getting a couple of the other colors now also) It lost it's star because of three things.  The ease of the glossy case/bezel getting scratched, the angle of the bezel makes it difficult to type a few different letters on the keyboard and third there are no covers for the openings. They are just open. So even though this is a case that still makes it possible for you to slide your phone into your pocket it makes it very susceptible to pocket lint and minor liquid spills.t</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006W03NVK" id="B006W03NVK-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-03:</strong> It fits my AT&T Galaxy SII Skyrocket perfect... easy to install and remove...

I needed this during a conference and I slipped my iPhone 5 into it and hit the button on the back and presto, I got an additional life out of my phone battery.  I've heard it's great for flights and when camping as well.It's easy to slip on and off.  It breaks into two pieces.  You slide the phone into the bottom and then the top pieces on and snaps into place.  You pull to remove.To turn on, you press and hold the button on the back until the lights flash.I got the gold, not black, and I like the color a lot.  It's shiney, but not too bright.Some have said they don't feel it weighs the phone down, but I do think it adds a bit of weight to the phone when on.  Nothing crazy, but I do feel a difference.  And it does make the phone longer and wider, but nothing unmanageable.It still fits well in my purse without any issues.Overall, I'm quite happy with this extended battery and would recommend it.  It's saved me on many a day.  It's easy to charge and to recharge.  Very useful.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HGZ247O" id="B00HGZ247O-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-18:</strong> (Note: This product was given to me in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. This doesn't affect my review in any way.)This is the perfect accessory for an iPhone 5/5s. It's no secret that the iPhone 5 and 5s have three major problems. Well this case deals with 2 of those. Number 1 the iPhone's poor battery life. I'm always hearing my friends complaining about how bad battery life is on their iPhone. Number 2 is the new lightning port. If your cable breaks you can't use that old cable you still have from the older models.This case fixes both of those issues. LifeCharge battery case holds a 2300mAh battery that extends the battery life of your iPhone by just over double the battery. The way it handles the other problem is by simply covering the lighting port. Since it is connected via the lighting port you can charge your phone with a normal Micro USB port on the case itself.When you charge the case, if your phone isn't fully charged it will charge the phone first and then the case will start charging. In my experience the case charges really fast. With this case on you don't have to worry about that lighting cable that you broke. You have yourself an easier way to charge your phone now. Since almost everything now a days uses a micro USB.The case has a built-in light indicator to show you how much battery is left in the tank.4 lights = 100 - 75%3 lights = 74 - 50%2 lights = 49 - 25%1 light = 24 - 1%What's in the box:- iPhone 5/5s case- Micro USB charging cable- InstructionsPRO's:+ Slim Case.+ More then doubles battery life.+ Charges fast.+ No more Lightning cable issues.+ Doesn't add much bulk to the phone.+ Has a light indicator on the back to know how much juice it has left.CON's:- Those of you will extremely small hands might not like the added bulk (even though it barely adds anything).Conclusion:If you have an iPhone 5/5s this is a case that I would recommend 9/10 if not 10/10 times. It's an excellent case for anyone. No real CON's here. If you want to get more out of your phone each day this is the way to go. Hope you guys enjoy & thanks for reading.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HGZ247O" id="B00HGZ247O-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-23:</strong> When I first got this case I charged it up, slipped in my iPhone 5 (that was very easy and, it turns out important), and began using it.Right away, I noticed:- Tap the case power button and it starts charging my phone.- Connect it to a charger with the phone still inside and it charges my phone first and then its battery.- It easily doubled the "battery time" available between charges.- The case was a tad larger than cases without batteries.Shortly I noticed:- I started to fall into old habits and occasionally forget to hook the phone+case to a changer and *still* have times when I would run out of batteries.- The phone+case didn't fit into my car ProClip or any other iPhone cradle I own.How I use the case now:- I charge the case and keep it in my briefcase, separate from my phone.  If I notice my phone battery is low and I need to be somewhere I pop it out of whatever case I'm using and slip it into this battery case.  Like I said, no effort at all.Only using this case on an "as needed" basis works out very well for me.  The two-piece design is what makes it easy for me to install my phone quickly and what sets it apart from other battery/cases I've tried.  Being able to easily remove the phone also means I can charge the case and phone at the same time.UPDATE: I've had this for a while now and use it pretty much as described above.  I DO NOT use it as my regular case.  Instead, I use it when my phone runs low or I know I'll be away from a place to charge up for a while.  As I said in the (updated) title, the case will take my iPhone battery from almost empty to 100% while I'm using the phone.  Then, the first chance I get I go back to my regular case and charge up the LifeCHARGE.  (The case will charge from empty to full long before my phone battery will run down.  That way it's ready to go when needed and can, if I choose, keep my phone active 24 x 7.I was sent this case so I could use it and provide an honest review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HGZ247O" id="B00HGZ247O-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-04:</strong> I like the fact that I don't have to use a lightning charger on the case itself making the device more available for affordable cords. The easy on/off button with indicator lights to show how much charge is on the case itself is a nice addition. Overall I would say that this case is a wonderful product. It is easy to install and use.Note: I was provided a free sample in return for an honest review.

It adds weight as will any iPhone battery case. The only immediate complaint would be the headphone jack is recessed into the bottom of the case. This could cause trouble when connecting headphones. I usually use headphones so I see this being a big problem. The maker does include an extension adapter to use, but thats just one more thing to keep track of. The other issue is that it adds too much length to the bottom of the phone which is part of the issue above with the headphone jack.The case utilizes a mini-USB connection rather than the proprietary apple connector, which is fine with me since I have other devices that utilize mini-USB and it makes charging a breeze and very convenient. If you want your phone to be as slim and light as possible, this case is not for you. If you are willing to compromise to get enough battery life to last 2 days between charges, then this case is a good choice.The look is great but I think Mophie still has a nicer sleeker look. Not to mention additional color options.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HGZ247O" id="B00HGZ247O-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-02:</strong> This LifeCHARGE ONT-PWR-35171 MFI Approved 2300mAh Rechargeable Extended Battery Case is absolutely the best thing I own for my iPhone 5! I use my iPhone to manage my small business social media, answer emails, and (obviously) as a phone. Before using this case I was never straying too far from a charger or portable battery pack, but with this extended battery case I can now go a whole day with constant usage and not worry about the battery running dry. Here are my observations:Pros -+ Quality; this is a tough case that has taken a falls without any damage to case or iPhone+ Battery; the extended battery is nothing short of amazing, bring the phone from 5% to 75% power on a single charge+ USB; uses microUSB instead of the Apple Lightning port, so all of my old chargers and data cables work+ Speakers; plays through the bottom of case, which is a huge improvement+ Charging; the case can be charged by itself or with the phone in place+ Protection; this has performed well in spontaneous &#34;drop tests&#34;Cons -- Earphone Jack; case has a deep pocket to allow access to the jack, but 90-degree cables will not fit in and nor will devices like &#34;Square&#34; credit card readers.

It extends the life of my battery considerably (my phone was barely making it through a day without dying, but with this case it will last into the next day.)  It's very low-profile so it doesn't add to much size to my phone, but it just about doubles the weight.  An added benefit is that it provides nice protection for my phone.This is an absolute no-brainer if you need extra battery time or if your phone is starting to lose it's battery power.  It will extend the useful life of your phone so you don't have to replace it as quickly which is a huge benefit.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HGZ247O" id="B00HGZ247O-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-22:</strong> This is a very attractive-looking battery case. Instead of looking like a wart on the side of the phone (as some battery cases can look) this has a very sculpted look to it that blends in very well with the iPhone.The case has a rubberized-like feel to it that is very fingerprint resistant. The fit is excellent &#8211; tight enough to avoid any slippage but not so tight that you need the jaws of life to get it off the phone. It&#8217;s a two-part design (top and bottom halves) which makes it very simple to put it on the phone. The access ports are perfectly aligned and have smooth, rounded edges.The capacity is 2300mAh which, considering the slim form factor, it pretty impressive. I very much like that there&#8217;s a 4 LED &#8220;gas gauge&#8221; on the bottom corner which shows the battery level left in the powerbank. It&#8217;s easily visible but not glaring.I also like that you can recharge both the case and the phone with a single cable.

It comes in 2 parts and clips around the iPhone 5S quickly and easily.  The case comes with a micro usb cable to charge the case.  The case itself only protects the iPhone on the sides and back.  It is very plastic in feel but does add an extra level of protection to the iPhone 5S.  It does take away the aesthetic of the 5S because it adds a bit of length to the phone, but it is necessary as this case is not very bulky.  It gives you plenty of extra power and I love having it around when I am out for the day and have no way to charge my phone.Besides making the phone longer and bulkier, there is nothing I dislike about this case.  It provides plenty of juice and helps protect the back of my iPhone.  I recommend this.*Item provided by Manufacture for review</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HGZ247O" id="B00HGZ247O-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-25:</strong> When the folks at LifeCharge asked me to take a look at this case, I was happy to do so, but I was also slightly guarded. I've heard good things and bad things about case/charger combos.If you glance through my reviews, you'll notice that I'm kind of a geek about chargers. I love having a way to charge my electronics when I'm not near a wall outlet. So right away I was interested in this case.I'll address my major misgiving first: the charge/discharge issue with portable chargers. This isn't usually an issue with larger chargers, but this problem is magnified with smaller chargers. With chargers smaller than about 3,000 mAh, or even with larger chargers that aren't fully charged, you can get to a point where the appliance you're trying to charge (your iPhone, in this case) has more power left in its battery than the charger does, so the charge actually goes in the wrong direction and your phone ends up getting drained until the charge in the phone and the charger reach equilibrium. That's not good. Even though the battery and the phone still have some charge left at that point, the slow reverse drool of power between the two batteries works against you and ends up draining both batteries. I've done the same thing with my Kindle tablet and a larger power bank that wasn't fully charged.Anyway, that's a geeky point, but it's a crucial issue with a small 2,300 mAh charger and an iPhone. LifeCharge's solution is simple and effective. They put a power switch on their case. That may not seem like a big deal, but it's huge. Just use your phone normally until the battery gets down to whatever percentage you're comfortable with (say 10%-20%). Then press the power button on the charger case to begin charging your phone. The charger will quickly charge your phone back up to nearly 100% again. Awesome!My second misgiving was that this would add too much bulk to the phone. I'd seen a couple of guys in the past who had charging cases and they looked awful. This one isn't as bulky as I'd feared though. It adds about a quarter inch to the thickness and a half inch to the length of the phone. It's really not bad. I don't leave mine attached to the phone all the time, but I keep it in my briefcase. If I know I'm going to be working late or stuck in a meeting, I can grab the case and not have to worry about my battery life.The case has two parts: a top and a bottom. The two pieces slide apart and make it very easy to install/remove the case if you don't want to leave it on all the time.It feels kind of funny to charge it with a micro-USB cable (provided). I'm so used to connecting a lightning cable to my phone, but the case uses the more common micro-USB cable. I guess the nice thing about that is if time is short I can actually use two cables to quickly charge my phone and this case separately before I have to run off again.The case also provides decent protection for the phone. It is made of a rubberized hard shell that protects the back and all four corners (but not the face). Everyone is different, but that's just how I like my cases.So I initially had my doubts about this case, but they were all addressed in the product itself and I was really worried over nothing. This is a good case. It's useful to me and does what I need it to do: It gives me about one good charge (plus a little extra) for my iPhone. Well done.I was provided this item for review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HGZ247O" id="B00HGZ247O-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-10:</strong> This is the first extended battery case I've ever used with my I-PhoneS. I wasn't really sure what to expect. I've been using the case for two weeks now. Here are some of the pros and cons of this case. Which overall I highly recommend:Pros:1) Easy to slip on and off the phone.2) Comes fully charged so its ready to use.3) Light weight.4) Looks sharp - the gold case gives your phone a classy look.5) Long charge - between the regular charge of my phone and this charge I can use my phone for email; texting; games; videos; streaming movies; etc., all day and into the night without having to recharge!6) Good value for the money!Cons:1) Protection - It's probably good enough for white collar work; but if your using your phone in a harsh environment (construction; dirt; etc) you may want something with more protection.2) It makes the phone longer, heavier, and a little more bulky - however - I don't know how you can get away from this with any extended battery on your phone!That's about it! The pros definitely out weigh the cons! I definitely am impressed with this case and enjoy the extra time it affords me without having to plug in my phone.

There seem to be two common designs of a case like this, both two-piece:  one that detaches at the top third of the case, and the other that uses a top frame to secure the phone.  This LifeCharge case uses the first design.  I like this design best over the two because the iPhone can be slid out in a straight line instead of approaching the lightning connector at a slight angle.  I don't have to worry about damaging the lightning connection in my phone.  The only disadvantage to this design seems to be a slightly longer case by about 1/4".Yes, a battery case will make your iPhone longer, thicker, and heavier.  After all, you are attaching an extra battery to the back of your phone.  The good news is that batteries are getting lighter and thinner, and so are the cases.  I can fit this in my back pocket without a problem, although people who carry their phones in their front pockets will likely find it uncomfortable.I get about 1.5 charges out of this case.  I like that it has an on/off switch on the back so that I can preserve the charge for emergencies OR charge my phone throughout the day until the battery charge is depleted.  This case charges through the included (or any other) microUSB cable, and plugging it in will charge your phone first and then the battery.  All the cut-outs match well and allow accessibility to all the controls, although you'll likely have to use an audio jack extender if you plug in earphones.This is a strong competitor in the battery case marketplace, especially if you like the slide-off top design and don't mind a little extra length.

Nonetheless, I am rarely able to go for more than a day without recharging my phone, even with a very light telephony use. I have several external batteries and power banks that I carry around with me at all times, but they can be annoying to pull out and use, especially if I am constantly on a move. Life Charge is an ideal product to have for iPhone power users, but only if you don&#8217;t mind the extra bulkiness that it provides.The LifeCharge Case looks and feels very well designed. It sits comfortably in your hand, although you will certainly notice the extra bulk. All of the iPhone&#8217;s ports and controls are easily accessible. The case channels the audio output from iPhone&#8217;s own speakers to the small speaker-like openings of its own. The case was easy to use, and iPhone 5/5S slides into it very easily.The 2300 mAh battery capacity is substantially more than iPhone&#8217;s own battery, and it&#8217;s on par with some high-end Android phones, such as Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy line. Use of this LifeCharge Case will more than double the lifespan of your iPhone. Charging itself was very quick and effective.What distinguishes this battery case form some of its competitors is that it&#8217;s MFI certified by Apple. This means that you will not have to worry about whether it will stop working with your iPhone if Apple changes its specifications in some future version of iOS ar the phone firmware.One issue that I have with this iPhone case is that it uses the micro USB port for its charging. This is an odd choice of charging input, especially considering that this case is Apple certified. iPhone charging case that doesn&#8217;t use the lightning cable is also not a very appealing marketing move. This choice of charging input will mean that you will not be able to sue any of the iPhone specific accessories and stands (like some external speakers for instance) that you might have. Many of them, however, would have been made useless thanks to the thickness of this case anyways.**** Product provided for review purposes. ****</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HGZ247O" id="B00HGZ247O-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-06:</strong> I was provided a LifeCHARGE ONT-PWR-35171 Battery Case for testing and review and was asked only to give my honest review, so this is what I found.What You Should Know Before You Buy:&#9830; Nice battery capacity increase for your iPhone without adding too much bulk.&#9830; Fits an iPhone 5/5S perfectly, but case provides mostly cosmetic protection, not protection from major drops.&#9830; Great design that allows you to slide in your phone and then slide on the top, no forcing or snapping bumpers around your phone.&#9830; Passed the "Does it Work" Test with flying colors and MFI certified to work with Apple iPhone 5/5S with Lightning Connectors.&#9830; Charges with an included Micro USB cable.&#9830; Has "Sync-Through" capabilities that allows you to sync your iPhone without removing the case.&#9830; The case covers the headphone jack, so you will have to use the included headphone extension to use regular headphones.Detailed Review:&#9830; Look - The product came in a nice hanging box with a lift up flap that showed the contents through a clear plastic cover. Inside the box was the battery case, a Micro USB charging cable, a headphone jack extension cable and an instruction manual all wrapped in a form fitting plastic holder. It is a nice looking battery case that doesn't add a lot of bulk to your phone, while giving you a nice battery boost. The case is built more for protecting from light bumps and scrapes, not major drops. The back of the case has a power button to turn on the case battery and four capacity gauge LED's. Overall, it seems to have a nice quality build.&#9830; Installation - Installing the case was great.  It was much easier than most where the top slides off, you then slide in your phone, and then slide the top back on.  There are no bumpers to force around your phone and no twisting or snapping to get your phone in the case.  It locks together pretty solidly.  Much easier and better design than some of the other battery cases I have tested.  No problem and the fit was nice and tight.&#9830; Use and Performance - To activate the battery case, you press and hold a button on the back of the case and the battery turns on. My phone immediately indicated that it was charging and everything started working as expected. The battery did a good job of charging my phone with no problem and the case felt good in my hand. Charging speed was as fast as typical chargers and added 10% in 10 Minutes and 15% in 15 Minutes of charging.  Right in-line with your average charging speed.  In addition, it did a great job of syncing my iPhone with iTunes right through the included Micro USB charging cable without having to remove my phone from the case.  An essential feature that working well.  It was a little larger and heavier than I was used to with my typical Incipio Dual PRO Case, but not too much. Overall, it worked very well.Conclusion:Overall, the LifeCHARGE ONT-PWR-35171 Battery Case performed very well. Installation was great with one of the better designs on a battery case that I have tried out.  It extended my iPhone's battery significantly while only adding a little bit of bulk. It charged quickly and synced my phone without having to remove the phone from the case.  If you are looking for a battery case for your iPhone 5/5S, this one is a great choice.

Most look like somewhat swollen versions of the phone itself and work fine. However, most rely, as does the phone, in the (proprietary) Apple Lightning connector plug. This case does not.  The convenient and readily available mini-USB port allows for this LifeCHARGE case to be 'loaded' pretty much anywhere. The appearance is quite distinctive - I have the Gold one. It does not look like other battery-pack cases but, on the other hand, it is considerable heavier than most of the others. For me, this was a bit of a problem because, when driving, I mount my iPhone with a  disk that adheres to a small magnet. The magnet will not support something of this weight.When I am where I am going, however, I find this case to be quite handy. The battery gives me at least one full additional day of use.  The indicator LCD bars seem accurate and indicate charge levels at 25, 50, 75 and 100%. Because the case, unlike most others, is quite easy to slip on and off, I simply remove it when driving long distances. The earphone jack issue does not phase me as 1) this is the situation with every battery case I know of, and 2) I rely as often as possible on Bluetooth devices. The Bluetooth functioning of my phone is not effected at all by the case. I do note, however, that like all other battery cases I have tried, this case seems to reduce/impair the strength of WiFi signals and this might be very important to some users.The bottom line is that this LifeCHARGE case is attractive, easy to charge, take on and off and charge. If I could alter one design element, I would reduce the weight a bit. It is a reliable, though somewhat expensive, case for the iPhone user looking for a solid battery case with a distinctive style and reliable functioning.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HGZ247O" id="B00HGZ247O-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-04:</strong> I have now owned several iPhones and damaged a few of them.  I use my phone a lot and have to carry around a back-up battery for it.  I was somewhat skeptical of this product as I have tried cases before them they were either too bulky or too fragile. However the idea of a case with battery built in was too tempting.So far I have used this case just a few days, but my impressions are favorable.  The color is a matte, pale rose gold which is sophisticated rather than flashy.  The case fits snugly. You might want to pair it with a screen protector for full coverage.The phone is made about 5mm deeper and about a centimeter longer when in the case--but I find it still fits in my pocket.  The battery is very easy to use.  It charges automatically and when you need to use the extra power you just push a small button on the back.The only minor inconvenience is that the extra part on the bottom means you need an extended USB charging cord and an extender for your earphones, but both are provided.  I just have to make sure I don't lose them.* Review based on a sample product provided by the vendor.UPDATE: Being a klutz I have dropped this phone on the pavement twice since using this product.  The phone was well protected both times and so not damaged.  The cover is a bit scuffed now and it is easy to see as the white plastic is showing though the gold surface.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HGZ247O" id="B00HGZ247O-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-26:</strong> First of all:Wow, when they say this is a custom fit, they're not joking. This thing fits so snugly on my iPhone it's like second skin! And this is a great because keeps my phone feeling solid-state, which I really like.The case is great and gives my phone a full extra charge and some pretty solid protection as well. Plus it doesn't add too much bulk to the phone so it's still highly pocketable. I also love the little led lights that show how much battery is left.

I was worried it might be a little gaudy, but it is actually as subtle as the gold iPhone.My teenager&#8217;s iPhone 5 has been going from 95% to 0% in about 5 hours.  I suspect it has something to do with camera and movies and texting and talking.  But now, with the LifeCharge case, as soon as his phone loses its charge, he is able to push a button on the back of it to start recharging.  Today, it went from 5% to 38% in an hour, even though he got calls and texts.  He is able to keep using the phone-text-machine-video-camera-camera-and-who-knows-how-many-apps while his iPhone 5 charges.This case has its priorities straight.  When it is plugged in to charge, the phone charges first and then the case.  This was a problem with the Mophie case he had a few months ago.When he lost his Mophie case with his last iPhone 5, he didn&#8217;t want to replace it, for reasons he never said.  But this case thrilled him when he saw it.  He especially got all excited about the charging cord (LOL and how does a kid go through so many of those?) and the headphone jack, which got him all excited.  I think his words were &#8220;ARE YOU KIDDING ME!&#8221; with that loud screechy voice that teenage boys are embarrassed by.  I had no idea the headphone jack was such a big deal, so he showed me how difficult it was to get the headphone jack in around his old case.  He says it is always that way with every case he has ever had with this phone.  He says, &#8220;This case rocks!&#8221;Sample provided for review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HGZ247O" id="B00HGZ247O-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-26:</strong> These days there are so many battery-included phone cases from which to choose that sometimes I have to get down to the picky, nitty-gritty details to differentiate one from another, because they all work.  And if you compare cases with equal amounts of mAh capacity, they will deliver equal amounts of power for your particular phone and your particular usage patterns.This case with incorporated extra battery power is nicely made.  It performs as stated on this product page.  You can buy it with confidence; it will perform.What makes it different from the many others that I've reviewed in the past few months?  Two things:  One of which I like, one which I don't like.  Turns out, after giving it a lot of thought, I dislike one feature more than I like another feature:  Hence, a four-star rating, rather than a five-star rating.  You, on the other hand, might feel that my dislike is no biggie.  Anyway, I'll make the point and you decide.  I just want to help you decide.As far as size goes, this case is so minimally heavier than the last case I reviewed as to be a non-issue:  It weighs a tiny one-tenth of an ounce more than some other battery-included cases I have been experimenting with.  Move the phone from one hand to the other and you cannot notice extra weight.  Comparing dimensions, this case is a little longer than some, but no thicker.  Yes, it is thicker than a regular case, but the battery has to go somewhere.  It is definitely a more convenient and lighter-weight and less bulky choice than a separate external battery.This is my nit-pickiness:  I do not like the angled edges compared to rounded curves of other cases.  It is not bulkier, the &#34;faceted&#34; edges just make it feel bulkier and not ergonomically correct.  I just don't like to hold this phone.  My complaint has nothing to do with the case's performance, which is great.  (I have long, thin fingers; not meaty at all.)This is what I consider a very nice feature, and I've not seen it done this way before:  The top third of the case slides off so that you can slide your phone in.  It is very secure.  Other cases have a removable frame around the whole phone.Another nice feature are all the speaker holes that go across the entire bottom-front of the case.  Other cases have  limited holes or a cut out for where the phone's speakers are.*I received a sample product from Ontrion.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HGZ247O" id="B00HGZ247O-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-20:</strong> Wow. And you don&#8217;t hear that from me a lot with electronic accessories. If you are looking for a case that gives you excellent battery life that will literally last you all day plus, then stop here. Even if you are a heavy iPhone user, I think you would be hard pressed to run through your iPhone batter AND this one.If you do then you seriously need to get a life.I had my phone on wireless, while streaming music, the screen on high, Bluetooth on, Netflix from time to time, and I was still only able to get through my entire iPhone battery and 40% of the LifeCharge battery. And I was trying pretty hard.So I just stopped because I was getting tired. If this thing is able to withstand deliberate battery abuse then it will have no problem handling my normal amount of usage.I do, however, have a few gripes. The case itself is slippery. Very. Not good for everyday usage. Because the iPhone fits inside the case to have room for the lightning connector, it adds a bit of length to the iPhone. I didn&#8217;t like that at all. The iPhone is a gorgeous device and anything that changes that irks me. To most people it wouldn&#8217;t matter, but I&#8217;m pretty&#8230; picky so it does.This case also doesn&#8217;t offer much protection. While I was very happy with the extra battery power, I found myself being way to careful when using my phone while in this case. I come from an Otterbox background and when I have that case on I pretty much don&#8217;t worry about my phone. And I&#8217;ll be honest, I don&#8217;t work in the oilfields or construction or anything burly like that. So my phone won&#8217;t be going through anything crazy nor am I that clumsy. Still&#8230; I need protection.But I use my phone enough to where I don&#8217;t want to have to think twice when I pull it out. I found myself doing that with this case. The experience of having crazy insane battery power was great, the experience of having a case that was slippery and not as protective as I needed was not.So there is a tradeoff here. What do you want more; battery power or protection? This is a very good case for extra power, just not a very good case for extra protection.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HGZ247O" id="B00HGZ247O-review21" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-24:</strong> This case really performs! It's excellent both for protection and for its &#34;real&#34; purpose of doubling battery life.The iPhone 5 fits perfectly and it's easy to get the phone in and out of the case. You don't need to charge your phone and case separately-- you just hook a cable up to the case and it charges both (phone first).It's not much bigger than my Otterbox case, feels good, and is not attracting dust/fingerprints. I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that it really doesn't add bulk or weight.You'll still need a screen protector because the case doesn't cover the screen (Otterbox does).This is so handy to have on days when you don't know if you'll be able to charge your phone, or when traveling. You can use it as an everyday case or just as needed. It charges quickly and reliably and seems to be built to last.I was provided with this case for review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HGZ247O" id="B00HGZ247O-review22" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-10:</strong> This is an excellent charging case. The case has a matte texture and feels very nice to the touch. The case is in two pieces. You insert the phone to the bottom half which has the Apple 8pin head, then slip on the top of the case to secure it. The fit is good and all the openings are in the right places. The phone case also gives a little protection due to the thickness of it.To charge the case you just use a universal charger and you plug it in at the bottom of the case. The case stores a lot of power. It has enough power to give your phone a full charge. So basically if you have a full charge on your phone and battery case it should last you all day.I love using these battery cases. On a day to day basis it's a lot more convenient to carry around just a charging case rather than a cable and an external battery.Overall, if you need to use your phone all day get something like this. Highly recommended.

It is slightly under 5/8 in. thick and has beveled edges.It is dead-simple to install:  the top section just slides off, the phone is slid into the case, and then the top section slides back in place.  It doesn&#8217;t interfere with use of the phone as all the openings are in the right spot.  It provides good protection to the back and sides of the phone and has a slight lip to protect the touchscreen, as well.  It even has a speaker grille at the base.The battery has a nominal 2,300 mAh capacity to effectively double the length of use of an iPhone.  There are four blue LED indicators for remaining capacity in 25% increments.  Just press the recessed button on the back of the case to show remaining capacity and to start drawing the reserve power.A USB-to-micro charging cable is included as well as a short 3.5 mm audio jack extender cable and an user guide.  With this case, the included charging cable eliminates the need for the sometimes-finicky and usually expensive Lightning cables.A sample was provided for testing and review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HGZ247O" id="B00HGZ247O-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-12:</strong> LifeCHARGE was kind enough to provide a case for review.The case is actually three different benefits.  First, it's a sturdy case for the iPhone.  Second, it redirects speaker output on the bottom to face toward the user.  Third, it essentially re-charges the iPhone when it goes down to a point, providing roughly a day and a half of heavy usage.The case acts the same way as external battery packs, used to charge the iPhone rather than keep it charged.  The iPhone will discharge as used, but then receive charge from the case.  That means that the charging priority is to the case, rather than the iPhone, if you have them both plugged in together.  That's not a negative, but it is important to understand that if the case runs out of charge, and your iPhone runs out of charge, and you plug the case in with the iPhone inside, the iPhone won't charge immediately.  The case has to get to a certain level of charge before the iPhone will pick up - which means you may need to begin charging your case before it runs completely out of juice.Another side note is that the charging is not via Lightning cable, but microUSB.  If you've had nothing but Apple's iPhone, this will throw you a bit, because unlike Android users, you probably don't have 5-6 microUSB cables laying around.  If anything, it should hopefully irritate you to see how inexpensive they are compared to the ripoff that is the Lightning cable.In testing, the case simply wouldn't charge when plugged directly into a computer via USB.  This is likely because the USB port doesn't provide enough output to charge; it's more probable that the case is picky about the port type, just like Apple and Motorola do with their products.  Some might find this frustrating, because other external chargers can charge via USB just fine, though slower.  If you're good with electronics, you might be able to short a USB cable to &#34;trick&#34; the case to charge at full speed.  Plugging directly into an outlet using a USB adapter (the one that comes with the iPad works perfectly) took roughly 3 hours to get sufficient capacity back from a completely empty state.Grip was improved using the case over the slim, &#34;slippery&#34; form factor of the iPhone.  The only issue is that the power button opening makes pressing the power button more difficult than it should be.  Hopefully a revision of the product will address this small issue.  Of course, the weight of the phone is increased dramatically due to the weight of the battery, so if you're used to the feather light iPhone, this will either shock you or turn you off.  If you're coming from larger Android devices you might find this to be a positive.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HGZ247O" id="B00HGZ247O-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-13:</strong> I wanted to use this for a while before reviewing it, and I've had excellent luck with it. The case is made of a good, solid, satin black plastic. Very simple in appearance with good gripping properties. The battery life is exceptional, allowing a full day of heavy use of the phone. Even better is the ability to charge the battery (and then the phone) with a standard USB charger (cable is included). This is a nicely integrated product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HGZ247O" id="B00HGZ247O-review26" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-26:</strong> The Apple 5-series (5S) with which I tested my review sample has less than spectacular battery performance, so I have more than a casual interest in this case. Let me say up front that there is a trade-off, but one I am glad to make: this takes the sleek 5S and adds a little extra size to it. Width wise the increase is nominal as is the weight. It does make it about a half inch taller, so if you love the phone's original size this will detract slightly from the aesthetics.Looks aren't everything, though, because use time is more important to me and I am not always around a charger. The 2300mAh capacity of the integrated battery is almost 1.5 times that of the 5S' internal 1560mAh battery. Even accounting for loss from charging that is still twice the use time of a 5S without this case, which is why I love it.Another feature I love is the way the case protects the phone. While Apple builds their phones to withstand a lot of abuse, this case adds another layer of protection. It is shock resistant, and the way the outer lip is slightly raised gives the screen more protection if you drop the phone in a carpeted office.Others have described how this case works and fit and form, so I am not going to repeat that information. I will say that the final selling point for me is this case earned Apple's MFi (Made for iPhone) certification, which gives me peace of mind. There are too many products on the market that are of shoddy quality or from fly-by-night outfits, so the certification is not only meaningful, but worth a premium price to me. Considering that this case is competitively priced is yet another value point and one of the reasons why I awarded it five stars.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HGZ247O" id="B00HGZ247O-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-14:</strong> The LifeCharge case is awesome at doing its job: extending battery life. Installation is easy because the case breaks into two sections. Simply break it into top and bottom, slip your phone in the bottom portion, then slip the top on. I&#8217;ll address the pros first then move to the cons.First of all, like I said, this case does what it claims: extends the battery life of your iPhone. You can easily plug the case and phone in for charging without separating the two, which is a perk. There is a button, along with 4 lights, on the back bottom right of the case that are used for charging your device and allowing you to see how fast the case is charging itself. After a full charge of the iPhone and case, I can use my phone until it&#8217;s almost dead, switch on the charge and bring my battery life up to 100% again with juice still left over. If you are a heavy user of your phone because of business or other things of that nature, this definitely will get you through the day and then some. To switch the phone to charging mode, you actually have to hold down the button on the back of the phone which I really like. This ensures that it won&#8217;t be switched on unless you need it. Charging the iPhone and case together takes about an hour or so, which isn&#8217;t bad at all. I found the rate at which the case charged my iPhone varied, but it would charge my phone from almost dead to 100% in about 1.5-2 hours, and that was with continued use during charging.I received this case in the gold color which has a glossy finish: I hate it. I have been using the case for about 2-3 weeks and it definitely takes getting used to when you usually have an Otterbox with a mix of rubber/slick. I wish they put some kind of rubber on this case because I feel like it would be really easy to drop. I, personally, am super careful with my phones so that&#8217;s not an issue, but for someone who works in construction, or similar jobs, or is just clumsy, this case is not for you. I also understand that the case has to become longer to accommodate the battery but I also don&#8217;t like this. It makes the phone even longer and slightly more awkward to hold. I definitely wouldn&#8217;t bet on your iPhone staying safe if you dropped it in this case. As stated previously, I&#8217;m used to an Otterbox that&#8217;s going to protect my phone from the back and front. If I dropped my phone face first in this case, the screen would certainly shatter. This case is primarily for extending battery life, not protecting it from a 10 foot drop, so you choose your battles.All in all, I do like the case. It does what it claims extremely well. However, I don&#8217;t feel safe keeping my iPhone in this case and therefore will be switching back to my Otterbox. This is just too slick for my liking. I will definitely keep this in my purse or car in the event of an emergency where I need extra battery power. I have actually bought portable batteries for my iPhone that are at least half the cost and, while they do require cords and the like, they also extend battery life without having to switch out your favorite case. I&#8217;d rather do that and keep my phone safe.

You also have a case that just feels right in your hands.  The case helps keep me from dropping the phone and if I do it will help protect it....as long as it does not fall on the screen.... :)I REALLY like the fact that I can charge both the phone the battery backup at one time with the provided cable.  Just plug it into a usb charger and all is taken care off.  You never need remove the case.  All controls are easily reached and with the case on it still syncs just fine to the cloud.  No interference.I think this is a high quality case.  I have gone through two cycles and it seems to function spot on.  You have four blue lights on the back and when you push the little button it clearly indicates how many of the four bars you have left.I have twice gone down to one bar on the LifeCharge.  Did not notice any hiccups when my phone switched over to the battery.  so it is a smooooooth operator.Just based on this short text time I can find nothing I dislike about this little helper.So if you are tired of looking for power jacks during the day this is the answer.  You can go easily a whole day with very heavy usage and still have some spare life left in the charger.Get one and I promise you will be a very happy camper.I received a free sample of this product for writing an honest review.

I do have a separate battery that I carry if I think I'll need it. But I know that's not true for everyone, so battery cases have their fans. The manufacturer sent the ONT-PWR-35171 to me and asked me to review it.The first thing I noticed was how large it was, in all dimensions. It adds a half inch on the bottom, an eighth of an inch on the top and sides and a bit more than a quarter inch in thickness. The back edges and top are beveled, though, somewhat minimizing the bulk. Still, the bottom headphone jack of my iPhone 5S was now deep within a recess that would make it difficult to plug anything in. On the sides and top, the buttons were accessible, but I had difficulty getting my fingers deep enough into the recess to push them. The opening on the back for the camera and flash is fine. The space below the phone has openings for the microphone and speaker - in use these did not interfere with sound quality at all.This case has a top part that pulls off. You do that, slide the phone in, then replace the top. If you have a screen protector that comes close to the edges, the case might dislodge it. Once reassembled the phone is secure and protected on all sides. The case is made of plastic with a matte finish that is attractive but I found slippery in the hand, Initially, it all felt very heavy, but the more I used it the more reasonable it felt. The case itself isn't really all that heavy - it was I think more the significant increase in size that made me think otherwise.I don't particularly understand why so many of the cases made for the iPhone 5 series have MicroUSB charging connectors. It would make more sense to me to have a Lightning socket. A MicroUSB cable is provided. As other reviewers have noted, you can't use this in a dock due to its offset MicroUSB connector (and certainly not with a dock that has a Lightning connector.)The battery charged fine - on the back are four LEDs, two of which flash when charging and the others indicate higher charging levels. A button can turn the battery on and off as desired. With it on, my phone stayed at 100% nearly all day.Functioning as an extended battery, the ONT-PWR-35171 worked just fine. I just wish the sides and top, in particular, were thinner allowing better access to the buttons. The bottom part seems a bit taller than what I see with some other similar products.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HGZ247O" id="B00HGZ247O-review32" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-06:</strong> I've had this case for about a week now. I was using a lifeproof prior to this. I live in Hawaii. It's summer. I'm in the water every day and love that I can take my phone with me and take pictures and video with my kids. I was provided this case from the supplier to review and here are my thoughts.This case does add weight and a little bit of bulk to the sleep 5s. I already expected that. Installation is very simple. You just drop the phone in and snap the top piece on. It does come with an adapter for plugging in your headphones. The well is deep with the case on. If you plan on using headphones other than the stock ones, you will need the adapter.What I love:I was able to go almost two days without ever plugging my phone in to charge. That was awesome. I normally run out of juice halfway through my work day. I listen to music, watch videos, surf social media, and play games aside from talk and text throughout the day.Although the case does add a little bulk and weight, it's not drastic. I could still fit my phone into my thirty one every wear crossbody bag easily.The case is a literal spare battery. When you need more juice, you power the case on (small button the back. Hold down for a few seconds). When you're done, power it off. So you're not constantly juicing your phone up unnecessarily.I never had to worry about not having a charger nearby. I always have enough juice remaining until I could get to a charger.The case uses a micro usb charger. So, I no longer need an extra cord on my desk for the phone. I can use the same charger I use for my other electronic devices.This is great for those traveling or commuting who don't have easy access to an outlet on the go.Because there is no "sheath" that covers the lens, pictures come out way cleaner than when trying to take pics with a lifeproof case on it.The bottom of the case acts like an amplifier. So the sound is great!I like that it's easy to take the phone in and out of the case when needed.What I don't like:The case is not water proof and I don't think it protect well if the phone is dropped.It is also a very slippery case. No silicone or grippiness to it (if that's even a word). I was so used to the security of my lifeproof that I felt naked without it the first few days. I still have the fear of dropping and shattering my phone.There is no protection for your screen. This is just a two piece shell that snaps on and off.The depth of the case does make it slightly inconvenient when adjusting volume, muting, or if you need to hit the top button to power off/on.  Not a huge deal, but should be noted. Good luck to those with long nails.One thing I do want to note is the charging time. I completely drained the case out this morning. I have had it plugged in for the last 8 hours and it's still not fully charged. Not a huge issue for me since I just keep it plugged in while I'm at work. I just wanted to notate that.When plugged in, it will charge your phone up first and then the case.I have not needed to plug my phone into my computer for any reason. So I don't have any commentary regarding the syncing.Overall this is an awesome case for those who need the extra power. I personally don't really need since I have a charger at home, one at my desk, and a vehicle charger. So, I'm always prepared to charge up when needed.When we go on our trips, I'll be switching over to this case so I have extra power when I need it.I will continue to update my review in the future with updates as I use it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HGZ247O" id="B00HGZ247O-review33" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-23:</strong> If you are looking for a great on phone battery extender, there are plenty of options. I have reviewed a few other extended batteries and have used them all. The LifeCHARGE doesn't bring anything outstanding or innovative to the table, but that's hard to do when these things are pretty close to perfection as it stands.That being said, the LifeCHARGE is a great choice if you need an extended battery. The price is good and the performance is just what you expect. The internal battery is a 2300 mAh battery, a little more than the iPhone itself. This extra bit is actually wasted energy as no battery is 100% efficient. So that extra bit of power ensures you get 100% more phone time than what you have now.In terms of using the battery, slide the case apart, slide your phone in, connecting the Lightning connection into the port. Slide the piece back on and now you have a phone cover and 100% more battery life with the ease of USB charging.When you want to use the battery, you actually have to press a button on the back of the case to begin charging the phone's internal battery. All of these cases are designed like this and I believe this is to extend the life of both your phone battery and the charge case battery by only charging when needed. The 4 bars on the back of the case indicate charge level, and once charging is complete they shut off.A nice feature that some of the original cases I used didn't have is that this is designed so you don't need an extender on a headphone jack. One less thing to carry is one less thing to carry.And the one less thing to carry goes with not having to carry a Lightning charger. Chances are pretty high you have other digital devices in your life that charge with micro USB. This means if you travel you can just take one USB micro charge cable and you can charge your phone, the extended battery and whatever else you need. And of course, that assumes you don't need to charge more than one device at a time, in which case you will be carrying multiple cables anyway...Overall this is a really well designed case that fits on the iPhone 5s perfectly. Highly recommended.I received a free sample from the manufacturer for review purposes.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HGZ247O" id="B00HGZ247O-review34" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-21:</strong> Most of what I would say has already been said so let me start off with something new.  This case actually makes it easier to take Selfies!  LOL  This may seem like a silly thing...but basically, the extra weight and size actually makes the phone easier to hold and use for me.  The extra length at the bottom actually allows me to have a firm hold of the phone and puts my thumb right in position of the shutter button.  It actually makes it easy to take selfies now with the forward camera.Pros:1.  Makes it easier to take selfies with the forward camera2.  Works seamlessly with the iPhone 5S3.  Has holes up front so it actually directs the speaker sound toward you instead of just shooting out the bottom of the phone.4.  No distortion of sound at all.5.  Micro USB makes it so I don't have to rely on the more expensive and delicate iPhone charging cable.  The micro-USB cable charges the phone, the battery case, and many of my other accessories as well.  This makes it so 1 cable is now all I need for most all my charging needs.6.  Excellent extension of battery life.  I now have more battery life than I need for a full day of use.7.  You push a button on the back of the case to get it to charge the phone - this is great so you can control when it charges.8.  There are 4 indicator lights in the back to let you know how much power is left in the case.9.  All buttons are readily accessible10.  Feels good in the hand - yes, it does end up being bulkier and heavier, but it actually feels good in the hand.  It's like I can have a really firm grip on the phone and not have it just flip out.What I don't like:1.  It makes the phone bigger and bulkier.  Yes...on one hand I like it - on the other hand, sometimes I want a slimmer phone.  Luckily, it's super easy to get the phone in and out of the case.2.  You need earphones with a straight connector to use with this case.  This is pretty standard with all cases and I wish they'd change that.  I like using my nicer earphones and they have the standard, larger jack.  That will definitely not work with this case as you only have a skinny hole for access.For all the pros, I can only think of these 1.5 cons...pretty good.  I would definitely recommend this case if you're looking for a battery extender of any kind.  I have the power banks that are separate and it's just clunky to be holding two devices connected to a cable when you run out of power in your phone.  This one is so nice because it's all together and it can recharge your phone without being a bother.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00HGZ247O', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00HGZ247O', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B008W1T3S4</h2>    <p class="price"> $B008W1T3S4</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

Don't trust the picture--these are super thin. They create air bubbles like crazy. Even if you think you've removed every trace of dust from your phone surface, as soon as you put the screen on, the screen will find any spec of dust within a 15 foot radius and create a huge air bubble around it--preferably right in the middle of your screen--that will annoy you daily as you use your phone. You can try to push the air bubbles out to the edge, but these screen protectors don't work that way and your efforts will be futile.These screen protectors are also magnets for fingerprints and the natural oils that our skin produces. They love it. They love to give you a nice, smeary look on your otherwise impeccable iPhone screen.These is a reason why you get three in this pack for such a low price: THE COMPANY IS GIVING THEM AWAY.You know what I do like though? I like that there is a protector for the back of the phone as well. Even when I replace the front one--which I absolutely will because these air bubbles and fingerprints are the bane of my existence--I will probably keep the back one. It has the same issues with the air bubbles and fingerprints, but at least I don't look at the back side nearly as much as I do the front.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003X6LPRK" id="B003X6LPRK-review28" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-07:</strong> i order my screen protector last week and it said it would not be till September and it i just received my screen protector about 3 weeks early. that is why i rate a 3.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003X6LPRK" id="B003X6LPRK-review29" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-01:</strong> I have not received this item yet.

There is a bit of a rainbow glare in direct sun, but that is usually countered by using the Auto-Brightness feature. I switched from these to an anti-glare b/c fingerprint oils tend to accumulate in the most touched spots.Application is a little tricky. Read through this, but know it will make more sense in the moment.The protector comes in three layers: two peel-off coverings labeled by pull tabs marked '1' and '2' and the third layer in the middle being the protector itself. One tab exposes the side that will be placed onto the phone screen and the other exposes the side that you will touch. The directions indicate to remove the layer that exposes the side to the phone screen, place onto the phone and smooth out, then remove the layer that exposes the &#34;touching&#34; side. If you aren't careful, you can pull the protector off the phone when you try to remove the layer for the &#34;touching&#34; side, thus exposing the screen to dust and more bubbles.  Your finished result will most likely be bubbly and unusable.I prefer to remove the layer for the touching side first, clean the phone screen, then remove the phone screen layer, apply quickly, then smooth out bubbles. Inevitably you will get some dust trapped in and have a few bubble spots, but they should be minor. Don't use a credit card or anything abrasive to remove bubbles - you will make marks on the protector. A softer piece of plastic works better (think a key ring card - cvs card, kroger plus, etc).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003X6LPRK" id="B003X6LPRK-review74" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-24:</strong> was perfect with having the front and back screen protector. very easy to put on and does prevent scratches :)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003X6LPRK" id="B003X6LPRK-review75" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-18:</strong> Both protectors apply easily.

BUT it is still very durable and protects your phone very well. This I know from experience as these screen savers have saved me many deep scratches from dropping my phone on concrete and asphault (i'm a klutz!). Again, you get 3 SETS OF FRONT AND BACK for only $1.20!!! The average life span of these screen protectors under heavy use is about 4-6 months before they have noticeable scuffs and scratches on them which you can see while your iphone is turned off (you can still clearly see the screen when it is on). So for $0.40 cents each set of front and back, you got your phone covered for over a year! And if you're not very good at applying these things on your phone like I wasn't at first, you have 3 TO PRACTICE WITH! I have gotten good at applying these and now can do so without having EVEN A SINGLE air bubble or piece of dust underneath.INSTRUCTIONS:The key is to wipe the phone clean, go to a non-dusty environment, take off the step one screen. Next, hold the protector from the edges (DO NOT GRAB THEM OTHERWISE YOU WILL LEAVE YOUR FINGERPRINT AND SKIN OIL UNDER THE SCREEN PROTECTOR, DUH!).After you line the protector up with the push button and speaker/front camera area, bend the protector (convex shape facing the phone screen) and apply it to the phone from the center first, then release and allow the rest of the protector to make contact with the screen. This process makes sure that no air gets trapped in the center of the protector. Next, use an old credit card or something similar to work the air bubbles at the edge of the protector out from under the protector in an OUTWARD motion from the center of the phone to the edges. And presto, protected phone screens for everyone!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003X6LPRK" id="B003X6LPRK-review85" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-27:</strong> It works and its cheap.

For the front protectors, the holes are not aligned well and are a bit off. The hole for the home button is too big. You have to align the protector based on the hole for the camera so that it doesn't interfere with your pictures, but by doing so, it makes the screen protector not completely adhere to the glass at the bottom. You'd have to cut the screen protector yourself by a hairline to make it stick flat. These protectors scratch a bit easily as I can see some hairline scratches after having them for a couple months.Overall, they're okay screen protectors being at less than a dollar. Be sure to take your time applying them and use one piece of tape to lift the screen protector and another to remove the dust that gets trapped underneath while you're applying it. You really don't need to use another film if you mess up. It takes me around 20 minutes to get a screen protector on perfectly without bubbles or dust.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003X6LPRK" id="B003X6LPRK-review92" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-19:</strong> I used 3 screen protectors but I could not apply them without bubbles or pealing shortly thereafter.

Shipping was over two weeks - I was notified  that the order had been damaged in shipping. When it did finally arrive, there was no packaging. I suspect that the shipping "damage" is what caused the delivered sheets to be curved, rather than flat, and that may be part of the cause of the issue noted below. But that's not the product's fault.Installing was simple, having done this many times before, but there was not enough "adhesive" or "magic" or whatever it is that holds down the edges, so there is a cosmetic problem right off. Again, that might be due to the curvature cause during the shipping damage. I know that the interior bubbles may vanish after several weeks, but the edges simply won't stay down. The product is cut exactly to fit, so you must take time to adjust the fit, but that is a plus as it doesn't leave unprotected glass around the perimeter.As this is my first iPhone, and part of my reason for getting one is the fit and finish of the Apple product [Don't start... I use Android's too!], I am not happy with these screen protectors, at all.Thanks again for playing. Good luck.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003X6LPRK" id="B003X6LPRK-review156" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-13:</strong> this is as good as you can get for a dollar less screen protector. definitely no brainer... it protects both front and back. used it for a month now and it doesnt look to fade or worn out like the normal >dollar ones do. good product</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003X6LPRK" id="B003X6LPRK-review157" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-26:</strong> Had I read all the other reviews,I would have not made this purchase.

It boasts that it is fingerprint proof and it is the complete OPPOSITE. I think it more-so collects fingerprints and they are very difficult to wipe off instead they just smear across the screen, as if the screen cover is constantly greasy. When the screen is off, you can definitely tell that there is some sort of plastic covering on it as it gives it a very weird sheen. This screen was also much more difficult to apply to my phone than other screen protectors I've used. I usually don't have any problems putting these on and I never get any bubbles but with these it was almost impossible to do it without at least some bubbles. I won't be buying this brand/kind again, complete waste of money/effort.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003X6LPRK" id="B003X6LPRK-review159" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-02-08:</strong> I hate to be a downer, but this is a pretty bad offering for screen protection.Note: This is my second iPhone - one 3GS and this 4G - and I am very comfortable with all "accessories".Here is the breakdown:- By far the hardest glass protector to get "into place"- Even after the protector is in place, it is impossible to get rid of air bubbles, especially on the rear protector- The material itself is actually quite good - I think it may be the adhesive the manufacturer used- The back protector is worse and is "puckered" everywhere- Yes, I thoroughly cleaned all surfaces with a high-quality eye glass cleaner - the same one I for my glasses and iPhones reguarlyI had to remove the the front cover because of the bubbles PLUS the fact that two cases were causing the protector to come off:One is the original "Argyle Lux case" and the other is the "OtterBox Commuter" case.Don't waste you money on this one, no matter the cost.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003X6LPRK" id="B003X6LPRK-review160" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-12:</strong> These do the job alright, but I also got bubbles under the screen, no matter how careful I was and they seemed to be difficult to get rid of, some I couldnt.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003X6LPRK" id="B003X6LPRK-review161" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-23:</strong> Works great.

I originally had the zagg screen protector on my phone before, but I hated how it made my screen feel rubbery, and would much rather have no screen protector on. These make my phone feel like it does not have one on at all. There is a pack of three front and three back, so if you mess up it is no big deal. One of them ripped after I had it on for a while, and I do not know what happened, because it was sitting on my lap. But I had two more, so it didn't bother me too much. The first one I had one had a sort of rainbow showing if I held the phone up to the light at a certain angle. But none of the others had that. These are great and so cheap.

I've had it now for about 2 weeks. With my origninal battery in the phone by the end of the day I'd be almost out of battery, and sometimes wouldn't even make it until the end of the day, now with this one I can get around 3 days. A full streamed movie will use about 5-6% battery life and trying to run it down I ran 6 movies in a row with it and was still over 55% battery life left!The back cover is the weakest point as it's just a basic plastic cover, I'd gladly pay more for a much better cover, and I'd almost considered changing the rating due to the cover. But for $20 I have an extended battery which I can't seem to kill in less than two days no matter what I do, and it easily can last 3-4 for normal use, how could I rate it less? I compared it to Mugen but that was $107, so this is 5 times cheaper.This is an excellent deal, great quality, and an incredible price.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6U0N56" id="B00A6U0N56-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-05:</strong> The battery is awesome - Im a heavy user, - the original note 2 battery - @ full brightness  would last 7 or so hours.

The back cover I received was slightly different than the picture displayed at the time I ordered the battery.  I noticed that the photo has since been updated.  I prefer the stepped case anyway. Although I've only had it for a couple of days, the battery appears to be working great. My eyes aren't what they used to be so I always have the phone brightness on full.  Today, I've used the phone for 10 hours now, with over 2.5 hours of that being solid screen on-time, and still have 59%.  I could probably go twice as long if I can the auto-brightness on.  The new back cover does effectively double the thickness of the phone but it still fits nicely in my shirt pocket and the belt holster I occasionally use.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6U0N56" id="B00A6U0N56-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-18:</strong> Best case I have ever purchased you will love the power of this battery it is strong and last all day and fits well.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6U0N56" id="B00A6U0N56-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-19:</strong> I have absolutely no problems with the battery. I get a full day charge for my Note 2 with heavy use starting at about 7am. I'm on WiFi, use my Bluetooth 4-6 hours daily, watch videos, email, download and play games. The battery is at 20% by 9 pm and probably would last until midnight with no problems.I'm slightly disappointed because the back cover is such a horrible and low quality material. I had to remove the cover about 3 times and the first time I did these little tabs that's supposed to secure it to the back of the phone broke off. There is an "air gap" now at the top because the tabs are gone. So now dirt is getting into my phone. Also the other two times I did remove it, it would barely stay attached and took more than five minutes to resecure it back on. This is extremely annoying. I'm hoping I'll not have to remove the back any more because it may not go back on.I ordered the Zero Lemon for my S3 and I would have done it again for the Note 2 except I was trying to save money. If I had known the cover was so bad (yeah, the other reviews said the same about the cover but this company claimed they fixed the issue-THEY LIED!) Now I'll have to order their $9.99 case to keep my phone clean and secured. I'm annoyed.The battery is great...no doubts there but the cover drops the benefits of buying this product because it devalues the whole productWould I recommend this to friends? To other potential buyers? ABSOLUTELY NOT! Pay the extra for the Zero Lemon with the better case. I gave it 3* only because the battery is long lasting but until they create a more durable backing and/or include a case in the pricing don't bother with this item.Side note in case Hyperion is reading-I KNOW FULLY ABOUT YOUR WARRANTY BUT AS A CUSTOMER I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO GET A REPLACEMENT ON A PRODUCT THAT IS NOT EVEN 3 MONTHS OLD! I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO CONTACT YOU AND GET THE RUN AROUND AND ASK FOR A NEW BACKING!

I've been a big fan of HTC phones and I even planned on getting a Galaxy S3 or S4 recently but couldn't pass up on the deal Amazon gave for this phone at the time.As a gamer I enjoy reading articles about what's going on in the industry and this phone helps out quite a bit by allowing me to set the home screen to display gaming news articles from some of my favorite sites.  At first I thought I wouldn't care for the home screen and after making a few modifications (not allowing FaceBook posts to appear...primarily) it turned out great!The phone is fast and after a month and loading all my favorite apps and games it's still as fast as it was when I unboxed it.  It has 32G of onboard storage and no way to increase that via SD card.  If you use some cloud storage apps (DropBox) for photo and video storage it certainly helps keep your storage space wide open.  I've put about 10 albums of music on here and with my 20-30 apps I've only used between 2 to 3 gigs of space.One of the best features this phone has is the dual front speakers.  This thing gets loud and it's amazing!  I listen to music on my phone when I run on my treadmill and I have almost no problems hearing it unless I crank it up past 7mph...and that's impressive.  I recently jacked this thing into some external speakers when I run and the sound output is crazy loud at max volume...so loud that I have it under half volume and it's nearly loud enough to drowned out the treadmill.  The other feature in the music app on the phone is the visualize part which scrolls the lyrics to most new albums as they're sung.  So if you can run and sing at the same time this is great!  Exhausting...but great.The only thing that I've been slightly weary about is the 4MP camera.  Yes it is no ordinary camera technology because it uses enhanced low light tech, and you can use the Zoe feature, but sometimes a simple camera shot doesn't seem as great as it could be.  I may just be used to the 8MP on the 4G LTE, but most pics turn out great and you have the Zoe feature to help ensure you get at least one good picture every time you take a shot.Gaming apps run really well on this phone and I haven't had any problems with them yet.  I know the S3-S4 is probably the better option for mobile gamers...I'm not a huge mobile gamer (at least not on phones).  But if you don't want a giant 5&#34; screen phone, this is a good choice for you.  The size is perfect for people with average to smaller hand sizes and the phone feels amazing.  The casing is smooth and overall just wonderful feeling.  I can't explain it very well; you'd be better off picking one up and trying it for yourself!  I'm 96% positive you won't be disappointed!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C6OLX8Q" id="B00C6OLX8Q-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-20:</strong> I'm just throwing in my 2 cents here and not go into a full blown review. That has been done by some very excellent reviewers here already.I've been wanting to get this since the summer of 2013 when I checked out the excellent reviews on the HTC One. Couldn't wait to get rid of my Samsung Galaxy SII. What a piece of absolute junk that phone was. It scores a whopping 2.9 star rating from Amazon reviewers... that is a 58% approval rating. Pretty sad. Enough said about that POS!My first smartphone back in 2010 was the HTC Droid Incredible, which I really liked... albeit the small 3.7" screen at the time. It would get a little buggy once in a while... but it was a very good phone. So I thought I would go back and try another HTC product and I'm glad I did.Pros:Excellent build, sturdy and thin. Doesn't feel like a cheap plastic toy like the Samsung's.Crystal clear LCD 1920X1080p screen. The Amoled screens like on the Samsung's look more colorful... but the colors are saturated compared to an LCD screen. LCD screens are more life-like and easier to see outside in the daylight.Excellent front-facing stereo built-in amplified speakers. Good volume, clear sound with no distortion at max. It gives you that nice stereo effect that finally matches the external audio experience with the excellent 1080p video quality. These have to be the best smartphone stereo speakers on the market. Is there even another company that puts out dual stereo speakers on a smartphone? I believe they're all mono... could be wrong.This phone is fast with a Snapdragon 600 Quad-Core 1.7 Ghz processor. I believe Samsung has the faster processor... but can you really tell the difference in speed between the two with the naked eye? I don't think so.HTC Sense 5.5: Wow... this OS is so smooth... exactly like Apple... as smooth as butter.Cons:Sprint's 4G LTE. I live in Orange county, CA. The map shows that Sprint's 4G LTE coverage is absolutely saturated with it. But at home in Anaheim it defaults to 3G. That's pretty sad. I was picking up full bars with 4G Max with the Samsung. Not good. I realize Sprint is the last carrier to get their LTE towers up, so maybe this will improve over time. Not too sure about that with Sprint. If not... I will be forced to switch over to AT&T; or rip-off price gouging Verizon in the future.I don't care for the placement of the power button on the top left of the phone. Should be on the side top right for easier access with one hand. Minor quibble though.That's it for the cons so far. If things change, I will update this review.P.S. This HTC One has been out for almost a year now, and still is one of the top of the line smartphones out there today. That's pretty impressive in itself to say the least.I don't think any smartphone is perfect. I would rate it exactly what the current rating is right now which is a 4.5 (90%).... But I give it a 5 star rating so not to bring it lower than it's 4.5 rating. If you feel the same as I do, I would encourage you to rate it the same.BB</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C6OLX8Q" id="B00C6OLX8Q-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-26:</strong> I can't say anything that hasn't been said but so far this works like a champ, a big improvement in many ways over my HTC one LTE (which started to have screen problems in the end) but I miss the kick stand and the dedicated camera button of my old phone.Overall, I plan to get this for all my family plan phones once they are eligible for upgrade.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C6OLX8Q" id="B00C6OLX8Q-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-21:</strong> I love this phone so much that I can't wait to get the HTC One M8!

I was very impressed with the fit and finish of such a low prices case.When I got the LG G2 phone and was looking for a case I first looked at Ditztronic and Cruzerlite and then saw that Fosmon had a TPU case for under $4 shipped I thought it was worth a try, and it was.I really like this case and it fits very well.  It does have an extra mic hole for the AT&T; version of the G2 (Mine is T-Mobile) but it's not a big deal.  The only thing is the hole for the USB cable is a little tight on the top so I had to open it up a tad.  Took me 5 minutes and looks factory.  Small price to pay to save $6 to $10.I will be looking for Fosmon cases first from now on when getting phone or tablet cases.  I have found them to be constantly good in fit and quality and a great deal</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F0X2QKE" id="B00F0X2QKE-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-23:</strong> I'm impressed with this case and would recommend this product for anyone with a G2.

For the price, I figured, Id buy a couple of spares in case one died.I ordered 3 of these and while the retracting mechanism seems to work very well, two of the three simply did not work.  I tried it in two different cars on two different phones.  In both cases, the red LED lit up, so it cant be a fuse issue, but neither phones indicated that it was receiving a charge when these chargers were connected.The third one does work, but only intermittently.  If I connect it, and leave the cord fully retracted, it does not charge.  However, if I pull out the cord almost all of the way, it seems to make the connection and charge the phone.I know I could probably return these, but for how cheap they are, its not worth the hassle to package them up and pay for return shipping.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000UERGYE" id="B000UERGYE-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-02:</strong> I purchased a bunch of these since my Girlfriend tends to destroy them on a regular basis regardless of the build quality.

What this means is that the speaker is very versatile if you like a broad-range of music from time to time.  But, if you listen to bass-heavy music exclusively, the speaker probably won't appeal to you.  But, for me this is a positive because I know this kind of speaker typically has less noise distortion at the lower frequencies and reproduces vocals more accurately.Another thing that should be pointed out is that this speaker by a newly, formed private audio company is marketed toward consumer-grade/ budget-friendly/ mass market division.Every once and a while, I'll get a question about how does this device stack up against this or that.There are three grades of electronics:ConsumerProsumerProfessional.Most of the devices on Amazon are for the consumer market, with an equal amount shared between the Prosumer division and the Professional division.  The standards (like the price) are much higher as you go up the line.But, this "consumer" grade device is well made, the sound is very good and its elegant design means that it fits nicely with your better audio equipment or cellular devices and not like those gaudy, kiddy-ish looking products that offers little in the way of value for the buck.This device is a winner.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FGR5XKE" id="B00FGR5XKE-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-23:</strong> I bought this to use with my Windows 7 computer, connecting it via a Bluetooth wireless adapter.

I was very surprised that the speaker is both pretty loud and pretty crisp, considering its small size.

What I really love about this one is the shelf inset to rest a phone or tablet. This makes it great for having a clear view and access to your device for music selection as well as using it to watch videos and movies while having great amplified sound. It's better to watch a movie on a tablet with the sound coming right at the device or else you get a disconnect.The sound is good. Nice stereo sound with decent volume. It can distort a little bit when the volume is all the way up though.It holds a charge for many hours although I don't think it has an auto off feature. It charges easily using the USB to micro USB cable and can also play from a device using a audio cable if you don't have Bluetooth.This is a nice unit with the benefit of the tablet stand in front.

The speakers produce clear and enjoyable sound at reasonable volumes.It connects easily by Bluetooth or the included 3.5 mm audio cable can be used for a wired connection.  It is compatible with almost any portable electronic device with audio and can also be used with stereo systems, desktop computers, etc.The 1,000 mAh internal lithium-ion battery provides portability for use outdoors or for convenience inside and a USB charging cable is included.There is a choice of three colors.

It seems to be metal casing, maybe being full plastic can give it a better range, but can't complain since the range is fine and doesn't feel cheap.It goes pretty loud for being so small. Only lacking is the lower bass from below 200hz and higher end is a bit artificial sounding, but again this is coming from an audiophile so can't be too critical for the size and price point. Overall it still sound very clear, with good depth and loud, and pretty good Bluetooth range. I think if you aren't too demanding and doesn't need anything fancy, this speaker may be good enough to replace a TV speaker, it could make a decent PC speaker too.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FGR5XKE" id="B00FGR5XKE-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-05:</strong> The speaker stand works on a very simple concept, just a plain stand and side firing speakers.  It is built solidly with thick gauge aluminum.  I got the coffee brown color which is officially called "business brown.  It is also available in champagne gold, light magenta, kiwi green, dodger blue and silveng white (typo probably).  The color and the paint is great - I think it is baked paint.  Just that the brown seems not matching any of my devices.  If I would have to order it, I would order a different color to match my silver iPad Air.It can accommodate most iPads and tablets, phablets and phones.  I put my Air and an Android tablet and it looks great. The stand has rubber pads with really nice grip.  It hugs the tabletop like a gecko.  The left and right speakers are protected with a metal grill.When you turn on the the slide switch at the back, the Bluetooth transmitter immediately looks for a device to pair on.  The sound is great with considerable bass and thumps.Cons:Limited to one angle of viewing.A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FGR5XKE" id="B00FGR5XKE-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-23:</strong> This is a really cool device.

Well I am pleasantly surprised that the Evo 3d fits nicely.The clear plastic window seems to be a little stretched before I got it, but doesn't affect the usage of the touch screen, although isn't exactly aesthetically appealing. This was an issue on both armbands I bought for myself and my wife.The actual strap doesn't stretch much if at all, which means that you will need to strap this thing pretty tight to prevent it from slipping. I believe if this strap had anykind of tackiness to it then slipping wouldn't be an issue. My wife experiences more of the slipping issue than I, but I think it is because of where I actually wear it.I will say that if you have larger arms you will definitely want to get an extender. I didn't get one, but I also wear this on my upper forearm rather than my bicep/triceps area. It doesn't slip there and I don't feel like I am wearing a tourniquet like I do when on my bicep. Plus I can see the screen and access the phone functions a lot better from the upper forearm area. Since I wear Bluetooth headsets it is perfect for me.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005DEKC9C" id="B005DEKC9C-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-10-13:</strong> I must say I LOVE this, I tested it out a little,stays on my arm doesnt slide too much.

This item is very very reasonably priced - for the price it's awesome.Having said that you aught to know a few things before you buy. Firstly, it's designed to fit several types of phones, including mine which is a myTouch 4G. Secondly, the fit is not snug - it's a little loose. Thirdly, the case is perfectly smooth - no texture.Overall, the case works just fine and it cost less than a sandwich.Also, the case was sent to me via the mail so obviously it could not be tracked. Initially I didn't know this and contacted the vendor via email to find out why the tracking wasn't working. They responded and explained the situation so that was great.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004ANKSXC" id="B004ANKSXC-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-04-11:</strong> This case fits great on mytouch 4g and I thought it was the perfect case but as I used it more  I started to hate it,why, because it's like a magnet when I take it out my pocket all this crap get stuck on the case.

It's perfect for when you want to go out, but don't want to carry a purse. The wallet itself doesn't look cheaply made, which is a plus. There's even a hole on the side so you can turn it into a wristlet. I plan to bring this to school so I don't have to bring my wallet and phone case. The thing is, you can only fit a couple bills inside (which would have to be bended, since its not a long wallet), which is fine, considering it's not a legit wallet. Anyways, I LOVE it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008DM10WE" id="B008DM10WE-review37" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-15:</strong> GOOD PRODUCT GREAT PRICE ATHYE WEAR WELL ON THE PHONEWOULD BUY THESE AGAIN WHEN NEEDED.

Arrived in about a week, 5 days before their estimated date.It is described by the seller exactly the way it is. Covers all of the phone except the buttons, camera, etc and very small area around the edge (to prevent screen protector peel-off, as advertised).Changes the feel of the screen slightly, and do notice it makes the screen look a little grainy at times, but that is expected with any screen protector.A major plus in my book, is that I also don't have to look at annoying finger prints all over the screen.Applying it is very simple. Took all of a minute and no air bubbles, first try.Highly recommend this product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008DM10WE" id="B008DM10WE-review42" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-04:</strong> I adored this case until it started to fall apart a month into owning it.

I will keep it simple because this product is not that complex. It is a very good iPhone charger, and fits like a glove in the 12v plug. The cables supplied are very very long! I just have a mustang, so essentially two people are in my car all the time. The wires are more suited toward giving the user control while being charged, if you have kids in the back seat or something. The extra wire, I just bundled up with a rubber band. I'm glad they provided more than less, that's different from what companies usually do.Now one thing I don't like is that my car (Ford) is not set up to shut off power to the 12v connectors when the engine is off. So if you leave an ipod, iPhone, etc. plugged in, it will still charge the device and draw energy from a car. The problem is that with a car off, the alternator is not running. Without getting into a possible debate, when a car is running, the alternator is generating a small amount of electricity to aid the use of the car battery. It's why the batteries last as long as they do. With everything off, and a phone, tablet or both plugged into the charger, it can really shorten the life of the battery. To prevent this, you can unplug the charger from the 12v port after every time you use it (unless you have a Toyota or just unplug your devices).I recommend this product for its price, quality and compact size.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009VDSQ5S" id="B009VDSQ5S-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-23:</strong> I bought this for my iPhone 5S and my iPad Air, and it works perfectly on both.

I'd still have chosen this battery if it had been labeled "used", because it was only $6.  But I feel like it was false advertising calling it new.

Top Shelf swears these are original OEM batteries, but unless Motorola doesn't know how to properly spell, then these batteries that they are offering as OEM batteries are counterfeits.

The good long battery life is what makes this product stand out and it last about the same time as advertise. Voice call quality is ok, not great -- missing noise cancellation so other party have a hard time hearing you in noisy environment. It's comfortable to wear but becomes a little weird when laying down b/c the band behind your neck could get in the way.So what's good?- Battery life was good, I was getting 4-5 days of moderately heavy use out of these. Charging were quick.- Headphone foldable to very small size and come with carrying pouch. This make it ez to take from home to work for me.- Earpads for the headfone are soft and comfy.- Range is good but not not great. Around 20-25 feet I was still getting music, a little bit further out, music start to cut out.The bad?- Audio quality to me was good. Not great. But then I have really nice headphones that I&#34;m used to so this could be a little bias- The button on headphone do not have good feels, hard to tell if you're pressing them. Would prefer more soft plastic button.My Wish for future model.- Wish it was bluetooth 4.0, this would be nice b/c battery life would be even be longer and enable some other neat status features- Noise cancellation on mic would be nice.One last note: A retail unit was sent to me as a sample for a fair and honest review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CANBF0O" id="B00CANBF0O-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-04:</strong> The concept is cool but it does not work as I desire it.

Usually wearing headphones can hurt your ears but this headphone is very comfy and helps you to have them on for a long time. The headphones are very light and fold easily so they are great for travel. I use this headphone at the gym, while I am driving or if just want to listen to the music. The headphone has a build in mic which allows you to use it to talk when connect with the phone or computer. The headphone can be connected to any Bluetooth compatible device. For example IPad, IPhone, I touch, tablets, kindle, and laptop. The design allows anybody to wear them so they are basically one size fits all.The audio quality is really good. When listening to the music, the sound is very clear. The range for the Bluetooth devices is about 9 meter. The battery life is really good. I listened 6+ hours of music and it will still going. The sound quality when making a phone call is great. The person who is calling you can hear you clearly. Connecting the Bluetooth headphone is very easy. Turn Bluetooth on your device and look for the Bluetooth headphone. Once the headphone appears (TT-BH-03) just click on it, both devices will pair and the headphones are ready to use.Pros:+ Sound quality is great+ Foldable+ Build in Microphone for phone calls+ Large button on the side (Volume, Start/Pause, Answer Phone call)+ Lightweight+ Comfortable+ Carrying pouch+ Good battery life+ Behind the head design (pain free)Cons:- No wall chargerOverall, I really like the product. You have to be careful with the headphone because they are foldable. I really want to give this product a 4.5 star but amazon doesn't allow it.

This headset is a great invention for wireless listening.  The headset itself sits resting on the back of your head instead of the top, making it virtually unnoticeable!  It charges through a USB port in about a half-hour.  Then with a simple holding of the main middle button on the right side, it instantly pairs with your iPhone, iPad, Tablet - anything that holds music files.  Easy to use, you can increase or decrease the volume with a simple finger hold on the right earphone.  You can also jump back and forth through your songs with a simple push of the button or simply pause.Even at several feet (I tested it up to thirty feet and through three walls), the reception is very clear.  When I went outside with my iPhone indoors, the music signal dropped, but immediately picked up as I entered back indoors.  Don't expect strong punchy bass.  But, the sound is crisp and slightly better than ear buds.As a phone, it is also remarkable.  When a call comes in, the music simply fades out and you can answer the incoming call.  The caller can hear you easily as well.  Even outside with wind, there is no interruption of sound quality.  The headset fold up neatly into a small 3" X 4 X 1.5" felt bag for carrying.  This is great for outside, the beach and on planes.  Note that this is not noise cancelling, so you can still hear noises and voices around you.  I like the lightweight handiness of the headset over a bulky noise cancelling set.  Headset generously supplied by manufacturer for an honest review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CANBF0O" id="B00CANBF0O-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-19:</strong> It came it a tiny box, but it was a folding headphone which makes it very compact.  It goes around the back of your head and hook on top of your ears so it stays.  I first plugged it to one of my iPhone dice chargers using the included microUSB cable.  I left it the for an hour and it was ready when I came back.Pairing is relatively easy. Press the big button with a symbol of a phone for a few seconds.  Blue LED lights up and the first sound indicates that it is now  on.  Keep pressing a little longer until the blue and red LED lights alternate, then you are on pairing mode.  My iPhone and mini iPad paired very easily.Audio quality:Probably, I wasn't really expecting much, but playing music was a revelation.  Sound is crisp and with some considerable bass.  It is clean. Very pleased with the audio quality.Phone calls:Phone calls work nicely.  It transferred immediately from playing music to phone and back to listening music after I hang up.  The other party can hear me very well.  I switched phones with my son to verify how it sounds on the other end.  It works great.  Just make sure you have the phone within 30 feet  of you when wearing the headphones.Troubleshooting:I had trouble hearing on the headphone after successfully using it the first time; this was after switching Bluetooth devices.  Music was playing OK, and it stopped when my phone rang, but I can't hear from the other line.  The phone audio only comes out from the phone.  Simple fix - disconnect Bluetooth and pair it again.Cons:When playing music at the beginning, sometimes it drops signal as if it is still  buffering.  But after one or a couple of songs, it plays great with no hiccups.I was provided a sample of this product, so I could use it and write my unbiased review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CANBF0O" id="B00CANBF0O-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-28:</strong> I've been using Bluetooth headphones going back 7 or 8 ears. Back then the technology was not so good and units tended to be big and clunk. More recently, I've managed to find something lightweight and state of the art of the "in-ear" and noise cancelling in the Sony Noise Canceling Bluetooth Headphones | MDR-NWBT10N W http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005MLPQPQ/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc;=1.But for situations in which I don't want to block external sound, such as walking the dogs, I wanted to get more traditional over-the-ear type blue tooth headphones. Amazingly, this product from TaoTronics offers great full-spectrum sound that you'd expect to get from something 3x time the cost. Here's a few highlights:- Great sound. I have eclectic tastes and list to everything from screaming heavy metal to Pat Metheny. With this you get cice bass along with accurate mid- and high frequencies.- No static. One in a blue moon, there a dropout of the signal, but most of the time it's lock on clear and sharp.- Comfortable and lightweight. The behind the head design takes some getting use to. But I really like the fact that this allows me to wear my baseball cap.-- Easy to pair my 7th gen iPod Nano.These days, with the great sound you can get through bluetooth, you really don't need to deal with the inconvenience of wires. If you want to step to that world, this is a great path.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CANBF0O" id="B00CANBF0O-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-18:</strong> I received one of these direct from the company to try out. They have not asked for or suggested that I write a favourable review, they have left me to write what I want good or bad.I have always opted for ear buds as my audio listening device of choice, so I didn't think I was going to like these. I was wrong, they are really very good, not just in terms of comfort, but also in terms of audio and call quality.In the box you get the headset, a USB charging lead, a small soft draw string pouch to store the head set and a set of instructions.The charging lead is just a standard USB cable that can plug into a computer USB port or a mains powered USB adapter like you get with an iPhone or Android phone. There is sufficient cable for the purpose intended.The pouch has a velour feel to it and will protect you headset to a small degree whilst in a rucksack or bag etc.The head set is cleverly designed to fold in on itself so that it takes up a minimal footprint in a bag and can even be carried in a loose pocket. They easily fold and unfold and you don't need to be an origami expert to do so. The joints are all free moving so you don't have to force anything. They are light weight with soft foam padding to sit on the ear lobes.When I first had them I have to admit that I hadn't actually looked at them online and I was expecting something that went over the top of my head like traditional head phones. I must have looked like a right Wally with these on top of my head, pulling at the ear pieces and wondering why they didn't reach my ears! Then I realised they were to go around the back of my neck, but they kept falling down. This is when I had the next revelation that I had them on the wrong way around - well in my defence they are not marked L and R, or maybe I should have read the manual first!When I finally worked out which way around they went I could see that the frame is designed to sit behind the top of the ear to prevent slippage and they hold the ear pads in place. Initially it was a bit uncomfortable as I wasn't used to this type of head set, but after a while of listening to music I pretty much forgot that they were there.I used them to listen to a range of songs and the sound was crisp with no distortion and no hiss. Once I had memorised where the control buttons were on the right hand ear pad I was happily skipping through songs and adjusting the volume up and down.Next test was a phone call. As the call came through the music faded out, the head set beeped to let me know and I just tapped the center button on the ear pad and I took the call. The caller could hear me clearly and I could hear the caller clearly too, all very impressive. A simple tap on the center button again and the call was terminated.I took these out on a walk with the dog and I had no repetitive thumping of a lead against clothing as I do with ear buds directly plugged into the phone and no wires to snag and rip the ear phones of my head. I don't normally run around, but I did jog for a bit and the head set stayed firmly in place.I was very impressed and a convert to this type of head set.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CANBF0O" id="B00CANBF0O-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-27:</strong> I got this to see if I could combine the sound quality of on the ear headphones (airfi32) in a more portable package.These headphones sound quite good. Not as good a seal as on the ear ones though and this reduces audio quality (to my ears at least).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CANBF0O" id="B00CANBF0O-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-06:</strong> I use headphones for music a lot, and the two really important things for me are sound quality and comfort.  I was sceptical when the distributors sent me these to test and review, but I am actually quite impressed on both counts.  They aren't real hi-fi, but for such small and reasonably priced headphones, they do the job well.Sound quality is not bad at all, especially for this size and price.  They have a good solid bass and clear treble.  I've used them for everything from Renaissance choral music to The Who and it all sounds pretty good.  They don't have anything like the depth of sound or real brightness of high-end headphones, of course, but the bass is very solid and the treble is clear.  There is some distortion at very high volume, but for my use this isn't a problem.The headphones are more comfortable than I expected.  They are on-ear rather than fully over-the-ear, so sound does leak out and may irritate those around you.  The neck band sits over the ears like the supports for glasses.  The whole thing is so light that it's not uncomfortable and, surprisingly, they don't interfere with my glasses when I'm watching TV.  I have also used them while lying down, and they remain pretty comfortable.Where these score really highly is in their design.  They are small and light, and the hinged back-of-the-neck band allows them to fold up and fit into the neat and very compact pouch which comes with them, so they'd be brilliant for travelling.  Bluetooth pairing is simple and the range is around 4 metres, including through a wall and staircase, which is pretty good.  They seem well made with decent ear pads and easy-to-use controls on the right earpiece.For everyday use I can recommend these headphones - they work well and are very good value.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CANBF0O" id="B00CANBF0O-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-29:</strong> Got this headset and used it for about a full week.Pros- great sound quality on calls and when listening to music!- easy to pair to devices- very easy to swap between listening to music and taking callsCons - if you wear glasses it adds more pressure against your head(gave me a headache)than I expected- only able to pair it to a single device at a time- when I used it in my vehicle, I had to constantly adjust it to stay fitted on my earsOverall, this is a really decent unit, I will use it when listening to music from my iPad, or hook it into game systems for online play.  As those aren't overly extended periods of time the pressure shouldn't be an issue.  But for using with a phone, it will be a backup unit where I can only pair to a single phone instead of another Bluetooth device I use which lets me sync both my personal and business phones.  I can't say enough about the audio quality though - it was great!I did receive a sample for review and have been very happy with this seller! I highly recommend this seller!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00CANBF0O', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00CANBF0O', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B0095VIIKO</h2>    <p class="price"> $B0095VIIKO</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

When I saw that, I emailed the seller to cancel the order.  The seller responded back immediately and told me that it was too late to cancel, but that they were going to refund my money and would like for me to keep the case anyway and rater it when I received.  Well, I received it alot sooner than was stated, and let me just say-- IT WAS SOOOO WORTH THE WAIT!.  First, this is not only a case with the kickstand for ease of use,but there's a case inside of the outer case that gives super protection.  It took a minute for me to figure it out, but once I realized that there was a case inside of the outer case, it was simple. You have to take the white case out of the pink case and open that white case up. It snaps back together around the phone and THEN the outer pink case fits over it... This case is amazing, fits snuggly, and protects great.  This is worth every single penny and should have costed more than what it sells for.

When I mean a lot, that  means at the very least 2 or 3 times a day. Lol So if your a lil clumsy like I am, then this product is a must buy!!! I do wish that they had a variety of color options, b\c white & pink aren't exactly my colors,  it's ok  though b\c now I know my phone is protected. The only complaint I have about these types of cases is if your phone gets jazzed up & you need to take the back off, it's a REALLY pain & am always afraid with breaking the case when my phone freezes up and I can't manually power of and back on.  These cases are meant to go on and never come off. Another great thing was it arrived wwaayyy before the due date. So walking out to the mailbox and seeing it was a surprise b\c I wasn't expecting it to get here so quick being that it's being send from Singapore!! Thrilled with the case and company. I'd definitely recommend it. =)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008APDZZO" id="B008APDZZO-review75" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-16:</strong> I loved this case, it was very beautiful and I saw that my phone was safe and protected.

However, this protection comes at the expense of loosing the slim/sleekness of this phone (in my opinion, one of the bigger selling points of it).This case is two layers. First, the plastic inner shell snaps on around the phone, then the rubber/gel portion of it slips on around the plastic shell. This provides excellent protection for your very fragile phone. It will probably be protected from most drops (unless you are unlucky enough to have it land with screen facing down on a protruding section of cement - it could happen).Drawbacks of this case:-Very bulky-Adds weight to the phone (probably doubles the weight)-Makes it difficult if not impossible to use certain ear phones-Covers the sensor that detects if your face is close to the phone while on a call.-Difficult to remove case (bad if you like to swap batteries frequently)-Difficult to press home screen and swipe from edges of screenAs for the sensor being blocked, there are two work arounds to that issue. You can go to call options in the settings menu and disable the feature that turns the screen off automatically while on a call. Or you can carefully break off the piece of plastic that blocks the sensor (it is towards the top of the phone on the front side by the camera).The kickstand works o.k. It isn't great and it isn't super sturdy, but on a flat surface, it will do its job and hold your phone up. I mainly used it to slide my finger through it and the attaching plastic piece in order to get a better grip on the phone (and it works well for that) - although this case greatly improves the grip on the phone anyway.If you are prone to dropping your phone a lot, I highly recommend this case if you want your extremely fragile phone to last. Otherwise, you might want to consider this case (which is the one I switched to and now use daily):Aduro Shell Holster Combo Case for Samsung Galaxy S3 with Kick-Stand (AT&T;, Verizon, T-Mobile, US Cellular & Sprint)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008APDZZO" id="B008APDZZO-review93" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-29:</strong> THIS CASE IS OK.

I had to cut that piece off with a razor blade now it works well. Also the hole where you plug in headphones its to small because the case makes the space small, you cant plug in beats or aux cables to connect to stereo. i also cut that piece off and made it bigger so those cables fit in, now everything is fine.

It's a nice case and seems to be made well, but when it is on the phone its very hard to get to anything that is right at the edges of it.  I literally put the case on, then tried to use it, then took it right back off.  Some may not see this as an issue, but I wasn't able to use it.  It was like I was trying to fight the case every time I wanted to press anything close to the edges.  It looked really nice on the phone and I was happy with the level of protection it offered and the kickstand worked great.  It was very hard to get off of the phone though... caused me to scratch my brand new phone while I was trying to pry the thing off.

The case grip can be a contributor to the fact I haven't dropped the phone since it offers a good grip -- much better than the OEM slickness of the phone -- and confidence when holding.  The grip is good but not too strong to make slipping in/out of a pocket difficult.  The case size adds some heft but still able to put in my Dockers slacks front pocket when walking or sitting for brief periods.The built-in kickstand works but it is somewhat difficult to engage -- one must pry with a fingernail -- and not the most sturdy.  When prying the kickstand open it feels as if it may break.  When open, the kickstand does not feel totally secure in keeping the phone upright when vertical, and when the phone is horizontal the phone shifts left/right when using.  It is a nice option to have but only plan on using it rarely and on a flat, level surface.I cannot yet compare to other cases but have noticed swiping the menu (e.g. notification menu) from the top is a bit constrained due to the case protrusion not allowing full finger contact unless the swipe is precise.  This doesn't bother me enough to abandon this case but it is more challenging when moving (e.g. walking, driving) and could be a source of frustration.Overall, especially for the price point, I'm satisfied.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008APDZZO" id="B008APDZZO-review109" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-25:</strong> Excellent bang for the buck!

I like the almost everything about it.  The aesthetics is very interesting.  The case is made of leather and has a lace just like a football. The touch and feel of the leather is a softer kind of leather which I am a fan of. It has a very long wrist loop so I guess for someone who likes to carry things around their wrists - this would be good for you. The lace is about 6 inches long which is longer than the phone itself. It fits the phone very well and holds it in place without a worry.  I'm impressed to see that this also is like a wallet were it has 2 slots for credit cards or IDs.  The case doesn't add too much to the thickness of the phone.The laces seem pretty cool but I'm not sure if it will cause an issue of getting caught on things.  When you have the case fully open 180 degrees you can easily stick your finger and grip the lace.  I hope that gives you an idea how loose these laces can get.  This is definitely for the football fan.

It has look inspired by a football, but you don't have to be a football fan to appreciate the design of the case. The laces not only look good but provide extra grip for holding the case. However, if you are looking for a present for football fans this design would surely appeal to them.The outside of the case is sized 5" by 2.5". It holds the phone by leather tabs at the top and the bottom of the case. The inside of the case is made from brown suede.  The design of this folio leaves the side of the phone open so all ports are accessible. The case has magnetic closure.  The case has a detachable 6" leather strap.Overall, I found it to be unique and attractive looking, nice to touch, and has a feel of good quality product.I received this case for evaluation from manufacture and shared with you my experience with this case.  I usually note positives and negatives of each product for unbiased review, but in this case I no negatives to report.The photo collage referenced in the review can be located by following 'customer photos' link under the main photo.Ali Julia review</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BG4KRR0" id="B00BG4KRR0-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-18:</strong> There are two schools of thought when it comes to phone cases. You either want a phone case with a cover or one without. If you like the latter, than this case is not for you. If you prefer the former than this case IS for you.This FRIEQ case is made of high quality leather with football inspired stitching. The leather is very supple and a real bargain for the price. I found the case to be not too bulky for a covered screen case. It will fit comfortably in a pocket. It comes with a detachable wrist strap (which I would never use), but a nice touch for those that would. Inside the front cover are two pockets for IDs, licenses, etc.  No need to carry an extra wallet if going out.  Just carry your debit/credit card, driver's license in the case and cash in your pocket.  All the required openings are there and are of ample size as to no impair the phone's functions. A great gift for the iPhone 5 football fan on your gift list!**I was given a sample to test and evaluate in exchange for an honest review**</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BG4KRR0" id="B00BG4KRR0-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-01:</strong> This iPhone case will not only hold your phone, but also your ID or credit cards as well. Inside the case, the iPhone is held in securely using a leather frame/shelf holding on the top and bottom. You slide the iPhone in from the top towards the bottom,  It sits on a leather piece that wraps around the base of the phone. The top is the same, and you fold a closure flap over it so both the top and bottom are secure.On the other side of the interior of the case, there is two card pockets sewn in, that will fit a drivers license, and ID card or credit cards. You could also fold up a money bill, and tuck it into one of the pockets as well.The case stays closed using a magnetic closure that works better the more you use it (leather softens up some).The outside of the case is a deep chocolate colored leather, which is also very soft. The spine has leather laces looped through it, and on the end there is a metal clasp (which is detachable) that has a leather loop for carrying the case on the wrist. I really like cell phone cases like this that provide a way to carry your cards with your phone, and this leather one is a beautiful one. Perfect for both men and women, it's really well made and super great looking. Very nice!A sample was provided for reviewing purposes.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BG4KRR0" id="B00BG4KRR0-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-08:</strong> Obviously this vintage brown buffalo hide leather case for the iPhone 5 was designed with football fans and coaches in mind. It's definitely a very unique design with the outline of a football on the front and rear panels. The leather lacing actually gives it a good gripping factor and is very comfortable in the hand. The lacing does not have the vertical center line as it would interfere with the opening and closing with the case and would make it too bulky. The dark vintage brown leather is complimented by a lovely cocoa brown suede interior lining on one side.  The other side, which had a couple of card holders, is also in the vintage leather.  A very solid brown leather lanyard wrist strap (detachable) with a deep vintage-color brass swivel and snap nicely rounds out the look and adds a lot of functionality to the case.The case itself is made of Brazilian buffalo hide, much in line with the footballs made for the NFL. The texture, however is finer. The Wilson football adds their own patented unique "brand" to their leather, as Frieq has done to theirs. The distinctive Frieq logo is nicely blindstamped in the lower right-hand corner. The stitching is meticulously done, least ways mine is. The cut-outs are spot on, including the one for the iSight camera.  As this is an open style case, your lighting connector, built-in speakers, lighting port connector, headphone minijack, volume controls, ringer/mute switch, etc. Are easily accessed. The depth of the iPhone 5 is approximately .29 inch (7.6 mm) and nestles quite nicely in this case.If you have an iPad mini there is a matchingFRIEQ Genuine Premium Top Layer Brazil Buffalo Hide Football Design Leather Caseto compliment this iPhone 5 case.  There is a magnetic clasp that will hold the cover shut when not in use.  If you are using this with the lanyard, it will swing and the magnetic feature offers up that little extra bit of insurance you'll need to prevent accidental loss.  This is a well-made case that would make the perfect gift for someone.  This very unique case is definitely going to score points with the football fan.Sample provided by the distributor for review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BG4KRR0" id="B00BG4KRR0-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-31:</strong> If you're looking for an iPhone case that doesn't look like all the rest out there, the FRiEQ case may fit the bill.  The color is called vintage brown, and it does indeed have a vintage, as well as rugged, appearance.  The leather has a very nice feel and appears to be of excellent quality.  The football-shaped stitching is even and uniform.

It actually looks much better compared to the picture. I was worried it will look tacky but it does look nice when it arrived. You insert the iPhone from the top. There is a tab the you pull to open the top. It also secure the phone from slipping out by inserting the tab back at ear of the phone.My first concern was that after inserting the phone, the magnetic cover flap is not closing. But after having it in for a few hours and the leather broke in, the cover is now closing the way it should. All holes and controls are easily accessible except the speakers on the bottom are partly obstructed (not a noticeably big difference on the audio though). I love the nice removable pseudo leather strap that is included. Front flap has two openings for IDs or credit cards.Sample item was provided by the distributor for an evaluation review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BG4KRR0" id="B00BG4KRR0-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-24:</strong> There are a ton of iPhone 5 covers out there -- that's the bad news.  The good news is that you can find the exact casing to match your specific needs.  This Buffalo Hide leather case looks great and feels great.  The leather is quite soft and comfortable.  Additionally, the case has a football-inspired look, so it would be perfect for football lovers.  In regards to the look and quality of this design, it's hard to top.The football-inspired laces on the side do afford extra grip on the spine of your phone.  The back of the case does have a peephole, if you are taking photos with your camera, so you do not need to remove your phone to do this.  The case includes a magnetized cover, similar to the SmartCovers that Apple offers.  The inside lining of the case has two small, thin pockets that will fit a driver's license for credit cards.Unfortunately, the leather is a bit bulkier than other materials out there, so this case does not fit well in a pocket.  If you normally carry your iPhone 5 in a suitcase or purse, this won't cause much trouble though.  Additionally, the case doesn't fold back well, so if you are taking a call, it can be a bit uncomfortable if the phone is still in its case.Overall, this is a good case, and its aesthetics make it well worth the price.  However, if you are on the move and you use your phone for conversation a lot, this case might not be the ideal one for you.  If you just want a sturdy case that looks great, this buffalo hide leather design is quite good.Additional information: I tested this case out with an iPhone 5 and it fits great.  I also tested it with an iPhone 4S, and even though it doesn't fit perfectly, it's still manageable.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BG4KRR0" id="B00BG4KRR0-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-03:</strong> The soft, two-tone, brown buffalo leather with pseudo football stitching make this a eye catching and classy looking iPhone 5 cover.  The interior is a soft felt like leather. This is REAL LEATHER.  The stitching is super precise.  The cover magnetically closes shut and has a oval hole to expose the FaceTime camera.  The iPad is held firmly in place by top and bottom leather edge retainers/protectors. The front cover has two credit card slots. There is a leather lanyard that can be removed with a easy release clasp. Very nice quality and styling. My only knock is that this cover makes the phone bigger than I usually like.  If you have a purse or if you don't mind putting your Drivers license and credit cards in it instead of a purse then it is more suitable.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00BG4KRR0', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00BG4KRR0', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B005Q4IPRU</h2>    <p class="price"> $B005Q4IPRU</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

Since I've heard so much good things about Google operating system I wanted to buy another phone and try it out. I first bought Motorola XT720 with Android 2.1 but realized that the SD memory with over 7gb couldn't be used when downloading apps from Google market!? So I ran out of memory after using up only few thousand megabytes of the phone memory.  There were other flaws such as not being able to create Yahoo email accounts for quick viewing of all the email accounts with out loging in and loging out with each email. Whereas iPhone you can have Gmails and Yahoo mails accounts and I have over 15 email accounts in which you can see it all at once.  I returned the Motorola and got my Mytouch 4g just two days ago and so far I'm loving it!  I say so far because who knows what will pop up after playing with it for awhile like I did with the Motorola.  Anyway, I checked the user reviews for this phone prior to purchasing and that the consensus was that it is a good phone but has couple of complaints such as speaker volume.  Sure enough, after trying it out, the speaker is really poor compared to the Motorola I had. The Motorola had dual speakers and this Mytouch only has one so when you're in a semi-loud environment you really can't hear too well even the volume is up all the way. Another complaint was the face to face video calling but I haven't used it yet and I'm not that much concern about it since not too many people have that capability on their phones so I don't need that feature at this time.  Otherwise, everthing else seems to work just fine.  I love the camera with flash and the video recording comes with flash light so you can record in the dark! I will continue to update if I see anything else I need to mention as I get used to using this phone more.Edit: December 13th, 2010I've been using this phone now for little less than a month and I'm changing my opinion from loving it to just liking it.  The things I really like about this phone so far are that what I mentioned before, camera and apps from Google.  Also, this phone does allow you to create more than one email accounts from both Yahoo and Gmails.  So I'm able to see it all at once since I have over 15 email accounts. It is, however, not as good as my iPhone 3G.  It seems to be much slower in retrieveing all the emails compared to my iphone and it's not clear cut looking either.  Ok here's the one MAJOR reason that I had to drop the star rating from 4 to 3 stars on this phone, and that is the battery life is ridiculously WEAK!  I thought my iPhone 3g was weak but it still isn't that bad compared to Mytouch 4G!  It is a pet-peeve of mine with a weak battery life on any phones, the CNET review says 4 to 5 hours of talking time but I really didn't even come close to using it that much.  I tried using the battery saver apps such as killer apps and juice saver apps but none helped at all!  I barely use it for no more than an hour of talking then did some internet surfing for couple of hours and my battery had drained more than 40%???  This is after fully charged!  So now I have to charge this phone about twice a day if not more!  I don't know if it's the battery that might be defected or not but it's a brand new phone and battery and I'm not about to go and spend another $40 for a new battery to see if it's defected or not.  Another flaw detection is that when I am sending some old photos from my laptop to my emails so that I could downloaded to this phone's gallery but it wouldn't do it???!!! I never thought this would be an issue?  This phone doesn't have a selection of which to download into the gallery format!  So the photos are just stuck there in the format under the email I sent and if I need to view it, I have to open that email and view it from there.  This is a major problem for me.  I will keep this phone and will be purchasing iPhone 5G when it comes out next year.Edit: 12/18/10Previously I complained that there was no selection in downloading the pictures from the email to the gallery on the phone and that is still true.  However, about couple of days later I found that the photos were there in the gallery??!!  It took about few days before it actually got into the gallery?  There obviously is some sort of delay effect.  I'm happy that it did get to be downloaded into the gallery but it's annoying still to think that it took so long for it to do it.  Strange.  This is definitely a bug with this phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004BNM86Q" id="B004BNM86Q-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-14:</strong> I am very surprised at the MT4G for it's ease of using, understanding and its performance. I have no complaints so far except for the nuisance of carriers loading up these phones with bloatware that eats up RAM in the background...so sad. It comes with 768mb, but user losed 150mb due to this act by carriers. Rooting does the trick and carriers will not help with that process because they just want the user to purchase their gimmicks...nice phone, though...hats off to HTC and not the carriers!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B004BNM86Q', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B004BNM86Q', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00362X4CU</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00362X4CU</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

In combination with simultaneous smartphone & battery charger (there are a lot of them on eBay from Chinese sellers)this charged spare battery allows for the quick replacement of depleted battery in the phone (no need to look for power outlet in airport or hung around outlet while battery is charged).I'm still using my antique Droid Eris because it's small and does the job. But battery doesn't last for full day if the WiFi is heavy used. The extended battery increases the thickness of phone almost twice. But spare battery doesn't need much space and may be placed in bag. During last 6 months have used it only twice during the business trip but it was a real savior.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00362X4CU', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00362X4CU', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00JPMQN1Y</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00JPMQN1Y</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

We both are heavy users ...facebook, youtube, candy crush,  etc.. we got home and watched a movie of course still using the phones lol and around 12 am phone showed it was at 20% and this is after using the phone heavily.Next day we charged them using the wall charger they provided .

This is true whether the fun is idling as in overnight on the nightstand while I sleep or during the day while I am working and using the SGS 5 extensively.When I first purchased this kit I was using the battery charger extensively.  It is somewhat slower than charging the phone using the Samsung wall charger/USB 3.0 cable that came with the SGS 5.  Not a problem, this is probably safer for the battery.  Now I use a different and much better system to charge my batteries.I purchased the Samsung Wireless Charging Back Cover and the Samsung Wireless Charging Pad and I couldn't be happier.  This system charges the battery seemingly as fast as the wall charger and so much easier.  I just set the phone on the pad and within minutes the phone is fully charged.  I haven't had to change batteries are open the charging flap on the phone since I received the wireless systemThis is great because I've seen numerous reports of SGS 5 owners damaging their battery charging port covers and thereby ruin the watertight seal of the phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JPMQN1Y" id="B00JPMQN1Y-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-31:</strong> Compared to the Samsung  OEM battery, these are weak.

I mean, common people. It's a SPARE battery just in case of emergency or you're too lazy to charge your phone and want a pre-charged ones ready to go when you wake up. Nothing beats the original of course, but this one does the trick of having extra power on your cellphone just in case your current battery dies out. I use my Galaxy S5 (rooted) really heavy such as playing 3D Games for 2 hours, Text message and calling the whole day and night, Netflix, lots of music listening, video calling, and also some tweaking and modding my phone. This battery does the job for the price. It is a nice spare for extra phone power, but don't confuse it as a complete replacement and ditching the OEM Samsung battery because generic ones won't last long. Nice to keep in your pocket or backpack fully charged without having to carry those pesky USB and power outlet. Also great for storing in your car  (just make sure it doesn't get too cold or hot where you live especially if your car is parked outside all the time).Overall, I recommend this product if you are looking for extra spare batteries, just make sure you also have the time to charge them.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JPMQN1Y" id="B00JPMQN1Y-review21" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-07:</strong> holds charge great and a good price for back-up batteries , nice charger to wall ,,</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00JPMQN1Y', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00JPMQN1Y', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B0076529QA</h2>    <p class="price"> $B0076529QA</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

Right away I was impressed by the easy open packaging, and it just kept getting better and better.These remarkable headphones have so much going for them I'm simply going to start with a list of all the features:Pros:&#10003; Fantastic bass boosted natural sound with excellent mid-range and treble&#10003; Frustration free packaging, headphones are beautifully displayed&#10003; Soft well padded earpads&#10003; small raised dot to feel which is the left speaker&#10003; headphones fold for storage&#10003; high end design&#10003; easy well organized quick start guide&#10003; included micro USB charging cable&#10003; 16 hours of listening on one charge&#10003; Easy quick Bluetooth connectivity&#10003; Up to 8 devices can be paired with these&#10003; included standard 3.5mm cable for wired listening&#10003; velvety soft branded drawstring carrying bag&#10003; one year warranty card included&#10003; 800 number for customer support&#10003; excellent microphone provides crystal clear voice sound&#10003; fast forward and play buttons&#10003; headphone speakers swivel freely for excellent comfort&#10003; freely adjustable headband sliders will fit any sized head&#10003; large multifunction button for on/off, answering calls, and pairing&#10003; blocked my ongoing construction noise as well as noise cancelling headphones&#10003; has NFC-near field communications-pair with your phone by just tapping together&#10003; intuitive, easy to locate by touch volume up/down buttons&#10003; exceptionally comfortable headband with soft padding-forget you are wearing them&#10003; control all the features on your phone, make calls, full control&#10003; Automatic switch off when no sound after five minutes&#10003; Available in either black or whiteCons:None.How do they sound? With both Bluetooth and wired connections, it sounded identical, and great.These are natural sounding headphones, with the bass boosted in a pleasant, not thumping, way. Midrange and treble are both excellent. I listened to some bass jams with these and they sounded fantastic, like I was sitting in front of some high end speakers.I was very impressed with the packaging. I have rarely seen such attention to every detail in any product, even to the point that the shipping carton was double thick, and made specially to fit the box of the Voxoas exactly. The packaging was then encased in a thick plastic sleeve.These look beautiful and high end, and two people at the gym where I was wearing them during my workout asked me what kind they were and admired them.The microphone quality is exceptional. I called several people and all could hear me perfectly and said it sounded like I was only using my phone. It surprised me since the mic is a small barely noticeable hole.These are not audiophile headphones. They can't compete with headphones costing $1000 or more. But they are certainly exceptional, and sound, look, and have the functionality of headphones costing twice as much.In sound quality alone they easily beat my earbuds that cost twice as much, and were equal to my headphones by a well known high priced manufacturer that cost over twice as much.At the time of this review, you can get a $20 discount on these. Grab it while you can. Right now Voxoa is a new company, but these prove this company will be up there with the best once word gets out about it.Do I recommend these? You bet I do! This is one of my rare ten star products.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EAYZ264" id="B00EAYZ264-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-24:</strong> These VOXOA Bluetooth Headphones are by far the best wireless headphones I have ever tried, both in comfort and audio quality. I listen to a wide range of music, including classical, '80s rock, and even some &#34;new age&#34; (to help me sleep) and these headphones handle all of them very well.

The VOXOA isn't my first set of wireless headphones, but it could be my last.  Well, until I end up breaking these I suppose.  VOXOA claims they are specialists in wireless audio headphones, and from their website, this seems to be their first product to market.  So, let's see how they did.Compared to my two most recent headphone sets,CyberBlue BSH10andSatechi BT Lite, the VOXOA is certainly a step above in just about every respect.  It comes packaged like a premium device, complete with travel pouch, instruction set, charging cable, and aux audio input cable.  Wearing them is quite comfortable, even after hours and hours, which is something I usually can't handle.  A bit of adjusting was needed for them to fit just right and not feel like they would fall off if I shook my head.  The padded adjustable band also folds, for tucking the unit into its pouch for travel.  During the initial charging, I had to refer back to the instructions as I couldn't find an indicator for the charging.  The indicator light is so unobtrusive, small, and tucked in, that it's easy to miss.  A few hours later and it was ready to go.  Pairing up via NFC was as easy as pie, though I could wish for the headset turning itself on when the NFC pairing is done, but that is probably beyond what can be done with NFC.  And for you iPhone or otherwise non-NFC users, pairing manually was as straightforward as you could ask for.I thought the sound quality to be excellent, as well as the level of volume that can be achieved.  In what reminds me of listening to a record, the sound is full, no matter the volume.  At max volume, as across several different music genres (my usual metal, electronic/industrial, dance, hip hop, and a minor bit of classical), I was unable to detect any distortion coming through the line.  The bass thumps the skin of the ear nicely.  The headset might not be noise canceling, but it didn't take much volume to drown out everything around me while at work and home.  Every possible control is built into the right earpiece, but set up so that they are easy to operate without looking.  Volume up/down on one edge, and the other with forward, play/pause, and back.  The button action is soft, but with a sure "click" feeling to let you know you did indeed press them.  Across each device and the apps I used for testing (Pandora, Google Music, Amazon MP3, and BeyondPod), the buttons worked correctly for each function, but with something almost like a hesitation.  Press, pause, action.  That pause was something I didn't see in either of the two previously names units, and was long enough to make me wonder if I'd hit the button I'd wanted or not.  A little annoying, but livable.  Total run time on one charge was in the range of 15-16 hours of continuous music playback at 3/4 output volume.Something not (currently) mentioned in the ad here on Amazon or on the VOXOA website is that that headset does have an auto-off feature, which activates at around 5 minutes.  The unit doesn't make a peep if it gets disconnected from your device, but does give a tone upon connection.  Testing disconnect/reconnect, I found that headphones to have no problem reconnecting repeatedly, nor switching back and forth between devices.  I'm unsure how many total devices can be paired with the VOXOA at a time and the information was not available on the VOXOA website, but only one device at a time can be connected.  *EDIT: 8 devices can be paired, according to VOXOA.* On the volume controls, note that they control the volume for the headphones, not your device's bluetooth media volume.  Low volume from your device to the headphones will result in low maximum volume from the headphones.The VOXOA has another neat little feature, which is that you can use it as a wired headset, should you want to save battery or the battery is already flatlined.  The sound quality in this mode is still very good.  The biggest change in this mode, besides the wire of course, is that none of the controls work.  As soon as the wired connection is detected, the headphones switch off battery power, and all control must be done from your device directly.  If you have the volume cranked up, prepare to have your ears assaulted.The one feature I haven't tried yet is using the built-in mic and phone functions.  That's coming in the next update to this review, as are the answers to some questions I had on the unit that aren't covered in the manual or online.*Disclosure: I was contacted by VOXAO and given a sample of this product specifically for the purpose of reviewing it.*</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EAYZ264" id="B00EAYZ264-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-07:</strong> Watch out Dr. Dre, the VOXOA headphones are out to get you. Well, they are better than Dr. Dre's headphones, they sound good with most music, not just hip hop and dubstep; and they have subtle good looks.The first song I played happened to be fairly bass heavy, they sounded good, gave my head a good thumping in a clear clean way. That first impression made me think of Dr. Dre or Beats immediately, only better. I then decided to move on to a lot of other music, probably the widest end of the spectrum from dubstep would be classic Delta Blues - a singer, guitar through an overdriven amp, and the occasional harmonica. Oddly, the headphones sounded really good with that cleaner, sparse music. It seemed that no matter what I threw at these, they seemed to act like a chameleon and sound good. They cut across most music genres (I don't think they would do well with opera or classical music).These are comfortable headphones, they are super lightweight and the padding is in all the right places. I have a big head and they fit around my glasses and do not press hard against my head. The construction is super top notch - the buttons feel solid, the whole thing is creak free (unlike the much more expensive Sony MDR-1RBT). I like the flat panels on these headphones; it makes it easy to find the buttons to control volume and tracks. Pressing the buttons or touching them doesn't set up vibrations or make noise, the exterior feels expensive and of a high quality. The headphones fold at the adjustment point (where you make the headphones larger or smaller) to make them slightly more compact.These are on ear headphones, meaning they sit on top of your ears. The padding is soft and the ear cup cover doesn't get hot after wearing them for a long time. Honestly, these headphones look really nice; they have subtle black tie good looks. There is a tight, well manufactured float for each ear cup, they gimbal slightly back and forth, and up and down.These have aptX built in for the Bluetooth. AptX elevates Bluetooth to near wired sound; it is an added expense that makes a big difference. Bluetooth pairing was as easy as any other Bluetooth device. Holding down the large rectangular button on the back side of the ear cup activates pairing mode. The flashing LED is gratefully located on the bottom of the ear cup, making it virtually invisible. These headphones pair in a secure mode, a four digit code pops up to finish the pairing on the device.On iDevices, there is a tiny battery icon that appears next to the Bluetooth symbol. That symbol shows the charge level of the headphones. I love this function; I've never seen it before and think it is outstanding.Bluetooth range is not great - I could really only get about 10 feet before the headphones started to break up. I couldn't get the theoretical 30 feet pairing distance. Personally, I carry my phone with me or it is nearby so that distance isn't a big deal.Controls worked seamlessly with my iPhone 4S. On the front of the right ear cup there are two buttons for volume. On the rear there are three buttons for play and track control. This is a simple and efficient arrangement, no need for more than that.The box contains the headphones, a nice crushed velvet carrying pouch, a microUSB cable for charging, and a 3.5mm cable to physically plug the headphones into a device. The jack is located at the bottom of the right ear cup.There aren't a lot of really great sounding Bluetooth headphones in this price range. I think these hold their own against the next level up, the $200-300 range. They aren't as precise or as open as the Bowers & Wilkins P5 or the Sony MDR-1RBT. They are tuned more toward warm low end, but maintain clean well maintained highs. These are comfortable, easy to listen to, lightweight, reasonably priced headphones.I was provided a review sample.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EAYZ264" id="B00EAYZ264-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-09:</strong> I just received my set of VOXOA headphones and *wow* I am thoroughly impressed. The sound is absolutely incredible, but let me start at the beginning:The unboxing: The VOXIA people have taken note from Apple and all the other premium brands and created simple, yet elegant packaging that perfectly follows the aesthetic of their product.The looks: These headphones are refreshingly inconspicuous. Lately it seems like headphones have to look like pair of Nikes with big logos and bright colors. These are black, beautifully matte, and don&#8217;t feature any huge logos at all. In fact, I had to look hard to see the tiny, size 16 font VOXIA on the left ear. Also of note is the unobtrusive *tiny* status light, which only comes on during charging. Compared to the several other sets of gaudy headphones I own, I&#8217;d describe these as *sophisticated*Weight: This is important to me. Too light and they&#8217;re flimsy/cheap feeling, too heavy and they&#8217;re annoying to wear. The VOXOA headphones, I am happy to say, are just right.Comfort: I wore these for hours without any discomfort. The padding, in combination with the great shape of the headphones, makes for a put-it-on-and-forget it. I might just be lucky, but I can hardly feel them on when I&#8217;m wearing them.The size: I have a big head, so some headphones don&#8217;t fit me the best. These fit like a glove, and not in a cover-your-entire-ear-like-those-guys-that-direct-airplanes kind of way. In the world of headphones, these would be a small/medium in terms of the size of the unit itself.Bluetooth pairing with my iPhone was easy.Controls: Buttons on the right ear allow you to adjust volume, skip tracks, and pause/play.And finally, the sound: The sound is beautiful across all ranges and really provides and immersive experience while listening to music. I listened to a variety of artists across a good sampling of genres and really couldn&#8217;t find a weakness. Everything sounded incredible, especially for the price tag.All in all, this is a great option for someone wanting performance without needing the perceived prestige that comes with a flashy name brand. Ultimately I think this set beats out the brands that it&#8217;s trying to compete with, and it does so at a better price point. And, for you audiophiles out there (I&#8217;m not one, btw), take a Google and you&#8217;ll see that I&#8217;m not the only one loving the sound.Highly recommended.[unit provided for review by manufacturer]</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EAYZ264" id="B00EAYZ264-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-09:</strong> I've used a number of different earbuds, and while some of them have surprisingly good sound for such small devices, I'm old school, from the days when I used to pull weak shortwave signals out of the ether using a pair of big headphones with rubber cushions that covered my whole ear. Well, The VOXOA HD headphones don't quite cover my whole ear, but they're close enough. Some earbuds do a pretty good job of reproducing bass notes, but the VOXOA headphones have nailed the bass - it sounds great. All of the music I played came through with excellent clarity and volume. Unlike some earbuds that completely block ambient noises, I could still hear louder background noises, which I prefer in case the phone rings or any other sounds I need to hear.Besides audio quality, the headphones beat any earbuds I've ever used for comfort. With the adjustable arms, the headset fit very comfortably on my head, and with the 1&#34; of adjustment allowed in the arms, I think the headphones should fit just about anyone.The headphones worked fine with a 3.5mm audio cable (included - 39&#34;&#8776;1 meter), but the real fun was enjoying the freedom of Bluetooth. Pairing was simple, with the headset pairing with my Kindle Fire HDX 7&#34; as device &#34;VOXOA Headphone 33X&#34; with no passcode needed. All controls are on the right side and are raised so your fingers can find them.I used the headphones for a couple of Skype calls. I was having problems with my Bluetooth dongle, so I used the headphones plugged into the 3.5mm audio jack on my laptop. The sound quality was very good, and the built-in microphone on the headset picked up my voice very clearly.A USB charging cable is included for recharging the headphones' internal battery through a USB port or an AC adapter.My verdict: This is a sweet pair of very comfortable headphones with great audio. They've quickly become my favorite listening device for music, Skype, and other audio applications.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EAYZ264" id="B00EAYZ264-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-10:</strong> These headphones are adjustable and foldable, they come with a nice carrying bag, a USB charging cable, a 3.5 audio cable, and a short instruction guide. They have NFC auto-syncing technology to work instantly with your bluetooth devices and the battery power charge lasts a long time. The earpieces are nicely cushioned although they don't wrap around the ear. These headphones are not too big/heavy while they are fairly solidly constructed and should fit most people fine. For both wireless and wired applications these work well. The built-in microphone and controls allow you to use these with mobile phones (the bluetooth signal is probably not as bad a source of EMF radiation as having your ear right next to a cell phone). The cost of these is still pretty substantial, though competitive with similar high quality wireless headphones from other manufacturers. If you are looking for multi-purpose wireless headphones these may be a good investment,</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EAYZ264" id="B00EAYZ264-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-31:</strong> Note: I received a free sample of these headphones from the manufacturer in exchange for an honest review.While I have never considered myself an audiophile per se, I have built up a really nice collection of various headphones over the years.  Between headphones I've bought myself and those that have been sent to me from various manufacturers for review, I have tried just about all of them.  I have everything from $20 airport kiosk headphones to $400 studio quality designer headphones.  I can also attest that while price does not always correlate to performance, it is often a strong indicator.  A pair of $100 headphones that do not perform as well as $300 headphones are not rated lower.  You don't compare the acceleration of a Ford Focus with a Jaguar, even though both can be quality cars in their own right.  Sound quality and price are just linked.All of that being said, it is also hard to rate headphones in isolation, so I have to compare them to something.  I have a pair of Creative HN-900 that are sub-$100, Audio-Technica that are about $150, Jabra Revo that are about $200, and a few Monster headphones that are $250-$300 (and I used to own a Bose QC3).  In conclusion, these Voxoa deliver quite impressive performance and feature set for their cost.  I certainly don't rate them as high as my Jabra Revo, but they are quality headphones that I am quite glad to use.First thing to consider is comfort.  These are nice and light, weighing in at just 6.3oz.  They fold for storage (in a nicely included carrying bag), but unfold into solid headphones.  They are on-the-ear rather than over the ear pads with a soft foam.  It's not memory foam but feels very similar.  I have a bigger head and found the headphones sat comfortably.  The top of the head band has a soft pad on the underside as well.  They were great for extended wearing.The headphones sound great connected either direct wire or with bluetooth.  One thing that surprised me was that they are not recognized as a USB device like my Jabra Revo.  The USB is only for charging, not for audio itself.  So to use it with your PC, you either need to use the analog audio out or Bluetooth.  Onboard controls are fairly simple to use, with dedicated buttons to advance the track, pause the music, and adjust the volume.As far as sound quality, these were nice and balanced but nothing really phenomenal.  They are probably outclassed by my Audio-Technica headphones which cost about the same price, but don't include Bluetooth.  For a bit more, my Jabra Revo have a much full sound.  I found the audio quality more on par with my lower cost Creative headphones.  The bass isn't particular strong and the trebles are a bit muddy.  That being said, they were pleasant to use and to listen to music through, and the difference only showed up when I went back and forth between these headphones and my Jabra or Audio-Technica.The biggest pluses of these headphones are overall comfort, styling, and the Bluetooth functionality in a low cost package.  The biggest downside is audio quality which just isn't on par with headphones that cost just a bit more, but is quite passable at this price point.  As a result, I rate these as 4 stars and recommend them for a good pair of value headphones.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EAYZ264" id="B00EAYZ264-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-10:</strong> These VOXO&#581; HD VXG33X Bluetooth Headphones are a nice surprise: a high-quality set of portable headphones from a brand previously unknown to the U.S. market. They are very handsome, with attention to proportion, detail, materials and construction. They are a pleasure to use, combining quality audio with painless Bluetooth connection, intuitive controls, and a comfortable fit.The headband is about 1 1/4 inches wide and is padded with at the top. Unlike some over-the-ear headphones, these apply just the right amount of pressure to stay in place yet remain comfortable over extended periods. Each earpiece can be precisely adjusted within a 1 1/2 inch range for exact fit. They also swivel about 15 degrees in all directions and have exactly the right thickness of padding for comfort and isolation without bottoming out. The padding is covered with a protein leather that is very soft and is not prone to retaining heat and moisture. I am very pleased with the fit and comfort of these headphones even after several hours of continuous use.The Bluetooth is the latest generation and the CSR8645 chip uses the aptX codec so it is audibly equivalent to a wired connection. Range is about 30 feet, the same as my other Bluetooth devices. The microphone for telephone use is clear, although it does pick up ambient noise. They are HD voice-enabled, and that technology began being implemented by U.S. telephony carriers in early 2013.The VOXO&#581; headphones are intended for use with portable devices but the sound quality produced by the 40 mm drivers is pleasant enough for everyday use. The sound is as good as similar headphones selling for twice the price and is up to the standards set by their appearance and comfort.Sound isolation is good for on-ear headphones, so that while listening to music, ambient noise is dampened but not completely excluded. Spatial ambiance and soundstage are better than most on-ear headphones, although certainly not as good as what would be expected from an open-back, over-the-ear headphone. Impedance is average; as with all headphones, it is best to turn the source volume up and then adjust the listening volume with the headphone controls.The sound is well-balanced with the slight bass emphasis that is expected in portable headphones&#8212;but it is not at the expense of treble. I was pleasantly surprised that flutes and violins were just as full and detailed as bass instruments. I have never noticed any muddiness, sibilance, or other distortion. These are quite versatile headphones and the sound quality is higher than average, certainly much better than would be expected in this price range.They are shipped in a sturdy box that can be used for storage or they can be folded to under 4 x 7 x 2 1/2 in. to fit in the stretchy sueded storage pouch. A USB charging cable is included as well as a 38 in. 3.5 mm audio cable; either will to allow them to be used as wired headphones without relying on the rechargeable battery or Bluetooth.The instruction pamphlet is easy to follow and organizes control functions in charts for easy reference. I didn't actually need to refer to it as there is nothing tricky about the way these headphones work. There is also a very generous warranty.Three hours of charging the lithium ion battery will give at least fourteen hours of listening at moderate volume. Fully charge the battery before first use.A sample was provided for testing and unbiased review. I have enjoyed using these headphones because of the combination of comfort and enjoyable sound quality and would definitely recommend them to others.Specifications:Sound pressure level - 108 dBImpedance - 64 &#120628;Frequency response 10-20 HzBluetooth - 4.0NFC-enabledAACaptXHD voice with echo cancellationBattery - 430 mAhSize - 176 x 165 x 32 mmWeight - 173 g (Actual 179 g or 6.3 oz.)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EAYZ264" id="B00EAYZ264-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-12:</strong> Disclaimer: I received a sample set from the manufacturer for review. However I write unbiased reviews and will not risk my reputation as a reviewer for the sake of a free product.The bottom line is that these headphones are far and away the best in their price class, and I liked them better than a high-end set that costs more than twice as much.I am a former professional audio engineer; I did location recording of orchestras, choirs, etc., for public radio and other clients. I relied on headphones to get the job done, and I compare everything with my "gold standard" Sony professional models.In professional headphones, accuracy and reliability are everything. Consumer headphones can maybe be a little less rugged, and can have a lot of nice convenience features, but they ought to be accurate. Too many consumer headphones, including expensive ones, shape the sound to give a result that the manufacturer thinks the buyer will like. The problem with this is that taste in audio varies, and sound customized for one genre of music may sound terrible on another. The biggest sin is overemphasized bass, something even Bose is guilty of.The Voxoa headphones are clearly designed for accuracy and they meet that goal as well as any consumer headphone that I've listened to. The bass is tight and natural. It has plenty of punch without being overdone. It sounds like it is supposed to sound. The mid-range is also accurate, although I thought I detected minor coloration in the upper mids. The high end is nice although a little short in what is commonly called "airiness" or "transparency." Overall very, very nice for a mid-priced headset.But there are other things that make this headset a good one. It's lightweight and extremely comfortable, probably at the top of the range. I didn't get tired after several hours of use; other headphones are often too tight. These adapted gently to my head size and floated on my ears. By the way, they are strictly speaking on-ear rather than over-ear (circumaural), but I was pleasantly surprised to find that they give just as much acoustic isolation as the larger over-ear units.I used these in both wired and Bluetooth mode. There was no detectable difference in sound quality. Pairing for Bluetooth is very easy and takes under a minute to do manually (I didn't test NFC). The Bluetooth controls are all on one side and easy to identify by feel. They are very simple to use with the exception of the large "multi-function" button. You had better read the instruction booklet, which unfortunately is written in English that could use editing by a native speaker.The unit looks durable and is an example of careful engineering. The audio cord is thin and I don't know how long it will last under heavy use, but fortunately it's got a stereo mini-plug on each end so it can be easily and cheaply replaced. (Some headphones have weird audio cords which are the devil to replace.) The charging cord also adheres to standards. A couple hours of charging gets you more than 10 hours of play time on Bluetooth. By the way, you need to "find your own" USB compatible charging source, as no wall-wart is supplied in the package.The only other durability question is about the pads on the earpieces. They are key to the comfort of the unit, so I hope they last, but I'm guessing they will.I give the unit five stars because of the quality engineering and good design, and excellent sound for the money.

It doesn't give my phone a full charge from 0% but it does keep me going until I can charge again if I have been using the GPS a lot while out and about.

I use them as back up batteries when I travel since my phone runs out of power so quickly. They are fantastic. I prefer the newer version as all the components are tucked into the little cube but the old one works just as well and is much lower in price. The micro-USB will charge my phone via the powermat battery case I have so it still works with my iphone 5.

I use it daily with the powermat charger. but the great thing is you do not have to have a powermat charger these batteries can be used with a mini usb connection to charger the backup battery.I bought this one for my wife who had been stealing mine and now she uses it daily also. I highly recommend these for people who are always on the go and always needing a backup power source for electronics. there is a newer model that I believe is called the dual 1800 any way it is a black charger instead of white. I can not say how well that one works but I can say this one works great and the only complaint I have is that the Apple connection will not work on my iPad 1 all I get is a error message that says &#34;the ipad can not work with this add on&#34;other than this minor set back since I use my phone more than the old iPad any way It is a highly recommended purchase.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00462QBCO" id="B00462QBCO-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-23:</strong> When I first plugged  it in it was a little slow but after a few minutes it started to work fine and has worked beautifully every since.

I had that phone rooted, so I could tweak that one to reduce some of the rebooting and memory issues that I experienced about month into owning that phone. It was running fine, then one day in late Sep. 2013, I decided to try an app (AKA Pimp My ROM, LOL!) that would make some extensive tweaks possible. I went crazy... initially I meant to tweak the wifi part only. Then, I began to check a few more options... then some more... more... until I practically went through every damned option available. I saw a reset button somewhere, but didn't think of pressing it, though I should have.(Though now in hindsight, perhaps I'm glad I didn't. ;))Rebooted the phone, then... boot loop... boot loop... BOOT LOOP...After a few minutes of this, I tried to factory reset the poor thing. Didn't work. (That killed the option for me to debug the phone with a tool that works on PC's as I learned later.) At that moment, I 'bricked' it. Useless! GRRR!!!Enter the Event! Ha!After some research in several forums, including Android Forums (AKA Phandroid), I chose this one. I noticed the similarities with the Rise (same CPU and graphics processor). I don't mind the lack of a physical keyboard. Before the moment I bricked the Rise, I noticed myself using the keyboard less, and doing more typing on screen.The extra internal memory for app storage helps a little, and the OS on this phone lets users move some apps to the SD card. Interestingly, the available system RAM on this phone isn't much more than on the Rise (360 MB vs 357 MB!).Even with that issue, I've noticed that the Event is a snappier phone. I installed 30 apps on it. Among those apps, I installed two that kills unwanted apps in the background after a set period (every two hours), and another that controls wifi and 3g when the phone is idle.I noticed that the phone seems to warm a bit, mostly when watching long videos or playing 3d accelerated games for an extended period. Most smartphones exhibit this side effect anyway, so this is nothing new. Some users have complained of the phones being nearly too hot to handle. I'd say those phones are either defective, has a stubborn app that refuses to get out of memory (they're bad, delete 'em if you can), or lack an app killer. Even if an app killer is used (or not), swiping apps from the multitasker list can help reduce memory issues.As far as the appearance, it's nothing special. The phone is a featherweight device. All black, all the time, unless you buy one from Radio Shack that has the red parts, or buy a colorful protective case for it. There are even some Otterbox-like cases for this phone, including some that are sold here. I'm going for a metallic red rubberized case + screen protector that should be in my paws in a few days. Because this phone is so light, it can be quite easy to drop if you aren't careful.Out of the box, the phone should serve you well, if your needs are modest.If you want a little extra performance, you're going to have to root the phone. And yes, I've had it done to my Event.This page has a guide that will work as directed for the Event. It is aimed at Rise owners: [...]UPDATED November 10, 2013: I have had the phone for a month. So far, I have about 45 apps loaded onto it, and it's working smoothly.A few apps have failed to work for me, most notably the facebook app. I realize that the number of apps I have is affecting the performance of that app. facebook is a MEMORY AND CPU HOG, and is probably best left off lower end phones like this one, unless you only have a few apps installed (maybe 15 or less, rooted or not...). Not even a few of the largest games and apps I have installed have created serious memory issues as facebook has (even the free ones with banner ads)! To get around this problem, I have email updates activated for the social media sites I use, and then view them from the Gmail app. Uses less memory, and I get the updates I want frequently enough while I'm awake. I then created links to the sites as bookmarks on my home screen, so I view them from a browser. facebook has most of its functions on the mobile site anyway, so I don't miss the app much. Still not suffering from FOMO, haha!At least tc electronic's TonePrint app actually works with this phone. I use that with my BG250 bass amp to change effects between songs. :)update Nov. 18 (typed from Event): The phone is as solid as ever. In love with the spell check! I'm thinking of putting a full featured program that will let me hack code on it. Ah, the advantages of rooting + Link2SD! =) All on a phone that cost me $55 (including accessories).Update Dec. 3: I've had the phone for a full 2 months. Since I rooted it after 2 weeks of purchase, the phone has performed well and very rarely rebooted itself. I have applied one tweak, and that is to improve WiFi response. I use an app called Andromizer, and increased the WiFi Interval scan to 300 milliseconds (0.3 seconds). It's long enough to improve reception, but short enough to help keep battery use down when idle. The WiFi automatically cuts off and switches to 3g (or phone service only if you don't use 3g) after about 5-6 minutes if nothing is being downloaded in the background.There isn't much that can be done with this phone if you want to tweak it further without bricking it. It may be possible to get a faster launcher if you want, but that's about the only other thing I can recommend if you want to tweak.To sum it up, IMHO if you root you need:1. superuser app2. Link2SD app3. /system/lib/egl/egl.cfg tweak (leave adreno200 line uncommented, add # to other lines)4. increase wifi signal to 300 milliseconds (you can use longer values, Andromizer limits this to 300ms, which seems to work fine for me)5. change launcher to something more lightweight or one you likeOtherwise if you don't root, freeze the bloatware that can be frozen (or don't want to use), and limit the number of apps to around 20. If you choose to use twitter, facebook and other apps that need to run in the background, get a cache clearing app that can clear cache automatically at least twice a day to reduce the chance of random reboots.UPDATE DEC. 10, 2013:I am still using Andromizer for implementing some phone tweaks. In addition to the 300ms tweak for WiFi, I've also enabled the 3G/4G tweak at the highest setting to speed up 3G internet. As long as there's enough signal, it really works! Great for when you can't get a decent WiFi signal. Keep an eye on that 2.5 GB throttling limit with Minutes Checker. Also, I used the One Click optimization setting. I unchecked the remove debug logger, and kernel tweak settings. IT IS IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT KERNEL TWEAK (OR ANY OTHER KERNEL TWEAKS) STAYS UNCHECKED FOR THIS PHONE, if you use One Click optimization! If you leave that checked and then reboot, your phone is as good as dead. It will boot loop until the insects take over the Earth... ;)I have also added an app called Greenify. This activates the hibernate function of the Android OS that is only available to rooted phones. I wish I didn't have to root the phone for that, but worth it if you can. Greenify can be used to select apps that should hibernate when the phone is idle. The benefits come in handy when the phone is unplugged, and not charging. This will help save some battery, and reduce unwanted activity in the background. All of that helps reduce unexpected overheating, which seems to be a problem with many low end Android devices.With the tweaks I put on this phone, I've been able to reinstall a few social media apps I stayed away from, due to memory issues. I put back the official apps of facebook, twitter, Google+, and ELJay, an app for LiveJournal and other sites that use LJ's software.UPDATE 2/26/2014I've since dropped Greenify. I found that it bogs down the phone when used with some streaming music apps (Pandora, TuneIn, etc). I have also "debloated" my phone. Read more about this here: [...] BACKUP EVERYTHING FIRST before debloating. You may want to reuse some of the apps at a later date, or reinstall them before unrooting and reselling the phone.UPDATE 4/28/2014I've now relegated this phone to backup status, as I use a rooted LG Optimus F3 as my daily driver. Still, I've managed a few tweaks to this phone that still make it useful. If you're still in the market for a cheap phone for primary or backup use, this can still fit the bill if your expectations are modest. The updated version of Link2SD now allows data to be moved to the /data/sdext partition. Initially, I did try to move my data to the sdext partition, but it seemed to slow down some programs for me, so after two days, I moved data back to internal. If you don't mind it, moving data out of internal can further increase space for new programs. Just remember to back up your SD card, repartition it from a PC, then enlarge sdext (I recommend 2 GB, but you can go bigger than that).I also installed an app called GL2SD. It moves obb (opaque binary blobs) files to your SD card's main FAT32 partition. This is great for installing some large games that would otherwise be out of reach for a phone like this. As with all object linking apps for Android, the device must be rooted. I tried one game (so far) with this linker installed. It's a first person shooter game called Dead Trigger. Unrooted, one would have a hard time even putting a large game on a phone like this. But with Link2SD and GL2SD working together, it runs... and quite well for a 1 GHz single core CPU phone! The game does slow down a bit in high intensity scenes, but it's otherwise playable. :) So there ya go... if you're on a budget and willing to root, you can run some hefty programs on this phone!

I bought it for my 4yo son to play with (Angry Birds, taking pictures, watching movies, etc), and it's great for that.  The only huge disadvantage is that it's difficult and risky to root this phone, and there are no custom roms or software upgrades available because the bootloader is locked tight.  Kyocera will not release access, because it is against their agreements with the service providers.  In other words, if you don't want to do anything other than use it as shipped and get apps from Google Play, it's perfect.

I know this is not an Otterbox review, but one thing I really liked about that case was it's complete enclosure of the phone. The case absorbed almost all shock. I'm not so sure this Trident case will have the same shock absorption as my old phone case.I used to drop my iPhone or toss it around casually in the Otterbox. I don't have that same confidence with this case, although I have dropped it a few times and it's done it's job protecting the phone.This case is still very tough. It's a supple rubber skin around the phone, with a plastic exoskeleton that keeps the rubber from wearing out prematurely, and give's it rigidity and protection from actually falling out of the case. This is inverse of the Otterbox, which is a plastic endoskeleton with a rubber skin.The rubber skin makes the phone usable for one-handed operation. Without it, I can't get enough of a grip on the thing to thumb the screen. With the rubber and appropriate bulking by the case, I can hold the phone in one hand and use my thumb to hit the screen. Makes it so much more convenient when I'm driving a school bus and feel like watching youtube or texting...I've only had the phone and case for a month, but there's no sign of wear or rubber stretching. That being said, it's had plenty of exposure to snow so far, and has held up fine. I suspect it's not going to handle lawnmowing dust the way the otterbox did (I used to stick it in the dishwasher), but we'll see in a few months.Another drawback to the case is the lack of a belt clip. Call me a geek, but not having a holster or belt clip for this phone is a major pain in the...pocket. It's a huge phone. I look like a 1985 nerd with it hanging out of my shirt pocket, and it's totally uncomfortable in the pocket of my jeans. Not to mention the lint it collects there. The case makes it difficult to find a generic phone belt-clip holster to drop it in, so I end up with a trade-off; Do I want to belt holster it with little to no protection, or do I want to protect it and have to constantly carry it or stuff it in my pocket?Overall, it's a good case. Much better than a simple skin or just a screen protector.I would give it 5 stars if it had a belt-clip and full display protection similar to the Otterbox.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D5UZC32" id="B00D5UZC32-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-24:</strong> This was purchased for my son and he really likes it.

Worked fine.  Fit is a little on the big side as it had a fair amount of resistance when trying to insert into my iphone 5 and ipad mini.  The fit reminds me of the cheap lightning cable knockoffs that I initially got from eBay when they were in hot demand.  The cable itself is wrapped nicely with a similar cable wrapping of an Apple OEM lightning cable.  However, after very little use over two weeks, the cable no longer works properly since it loses connection when the cable is bent a certain way.  This speaks to its lack of durability and overall quality.  The trouble to package and send in for a refund is just not worth it based on the relatively low cost.  I'm just chalking this up to experience and recommend others learn from my experience and avoid this product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CL5A4KI" id="B00CL5A4KI-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-04:</strong> This is such a needed cable.

It is nice and short so you don't have to dangle the extra cable that is with most other cables. This cable is white and the wire is flat. It is also 5 inches long. This Lightning cable works with iOS 7 but it gives an error when you go to charge your device, which can easily be ignored. The Lightning cable works with syncing with iTunes and charging your device. I really like this cable mainly because it is short and does the job syncing with my laptop.I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00CL5A4KI', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00CL5A4KI', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00DD9MS3W</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00DD9MS3W</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

I thought I was downgrading on protection by getting this case since it was so slim and fit on the phone but boy was I wrong. Just the other day as I was getting out of my car for some odd reason as if an invisible lighting strike had hit me, I dropped all my stuff that was in my hand from shoulder height. Well I should say I actually threw it up not just let the grasp go. Sure enough I was freaking out that the drop was just too much for the case; Opened it up and wham all nice and clean. No cracks or scratches, just damage to the case. I would recommend this case for everyone as it keeps the phone from bulging up like other cases, its just so slim and fit! The screen protector is a plus too</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E8GQEQ6" id="B00E8GQEQ6-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-21:</strong> Overall a great case for someone looking for a full-time case that offers good corner and front-face protection.  It fits and looks really nice, there's no play or movement, it just becomes part of the phone. It can be a little difficult to remove, so I wouldn't recommend it to someone who switches cases frequently.Nearly the perfect case for a moto X.  I'd love to give this 4.5 stars if I could, but there's just a couple things keeping it from being perfect:- Buttons are fairly stiff, even after a few months of break-in.- The edges are a bit sharp along the front/back mold joint line, and feel harsh against the hand.The material is a flexible TPU plastic that's a bit stiffer than most TPU cases, which I really like. There's no sticky feeling to the case; it adds just enough grip while still being easy to remove from a pocket.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E8GQEQ6" id="B00E8GQEQ6-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-04:</strong> I put this this on the Moto X and found it to be one of the better looking and best fitting cases that has been on the phone!

Unfortunately, it is not.However, the case is as described, and for $10 shipped to my door, I can't really complain.  The case adds very little to the phone and holds it very snug.  The first time getting it on was a bit of a chore, but I'd rather that be the case than have a loose fitting case.The back is a hard frosted plastic, which allows me to see (kind of) the back of the phone.  I don't have a custom Moto X, so I really don't care.  It is cool to see the carbon fiber through it.As far as the edges go, they are a bit sharp from the molding process (I assume this is the cause).  If I was getting really picky, I'd ask for a little bit more grip to it as well, however it doesn't slip from my hands and slides easily into my pocket.The biggest surprise with this purchase was the screen protector.  Most of the time, they are complete garbage and I typically put them on until I can find my way to a Zagg Invisible Shield Kiosk, however this one fits amazing, and went on almost flawless!  (Would have been flawless, but I hadn't anticipated a quality screen protector, so I didn't spend an adequate amount of time dusting the screen).Overall, good case, very good screen protector, excellent value.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E8GQEQ6" id="B00E8GQEQ6-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-02:</strong> I've had this case for about three weeks with my Moto X from Republic Wireless. So far, I love it! My moto x is black, and the blue and matte case complimented it perfectly, even though the back was a little more frosted than I expected. But the longer I have it, the more the matte back grows on me! For those of you who we're wondering how tough the plastic part is, it is not a squishy plastic. It is very tough. The case feels very good in the hand. I like that they kept the dimple on the back, unlike other cases that just cover it up. For those of you who want to see the case on the moto x, such as how the back looks like on the device (since no photo of the back with the case on the device is provided,) you can shoot me an email @ David.Spaulding166@gmail.com.P.S.  People keep asking if the case is actually just the phone or if I have a case on the phone. That's how well the case fits!!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E8GQEQ6" id="B00E8GQEQ6-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-28:</strong> I'm very happy with this case.  it is the same quality as Speck and Incipio cases I've had in the past and is well designed.

The case follows the contours of the phone to continue making this phone easy to handle. I've dropped my phone countless times and the case has a done a spectacular job keeping the phone safe (the clear plastic doesn't take a beating too well and will show quickly show scratches and scuffing) . One caveat is the color case isn't red enough, under the right lighting the red looks pink.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E8GQEQ6" id="B00E8GQEQ6-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-17:</strong> The good points for this case is that it adds very little bulk to the phone and I think it works well for protecting from scuffs and short drops. I also like that it preserves the dimple on the back of the moto x. I did not find the edges to be uncomfortable as others reported.It looks and feels cheap, which, at this price, should be expected. I'm not a fan of the angular design; it seems to clash the design of the moto x. The case actually feels a little slippery, especially the back part (which is frosted transparent). The buttons on this case are too stiff; you have to really press them hard. I've had other cheap TPU cases with hard buttons, and I resolved that by taping a little &#34;shim&#34; on the inside of the case in the button area. The shim results in less pressure being required to press the buttons. You can adjust the pressure required by adjusting the thickness of the shim. A couple layers of thick card stock paper should do it.The case is okay, but I'm not a fan of the way it looks. I went with this one over others because this one preserves the dimple on the back of the phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E8GQEQ6" id="B00E8GQEQ6-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-30:</strong> Good Case - Keeps the phone in great shape.

I like my Moto X much better now.  It does add some protection to the phone, and the case goes around to the front slightly providing protection to your screen if you like to lay your phone face down.  All of the cut outs are flawless and adds some pop to the phone and provides more grip.  A nice surprise was the free screen protector and cloth it came with.  Was easy to put on, and is very nice.  I will order more of these in each color.Updated my review and removing 1 star because after a week of use I have discovered the case can be difficult to put on and take off, and what I dislike the most is it attracts lint/dirt to the front of the screen and you can't just wipe it off because of the way the case wraps around.  All the dirt get's pulled to the corners and can get under the case so you have to be careful.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E8GQEQ6" id="B00E8GQEQ6-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-06:</strong> Good case if you want good protection.

Very snug, form fitting and holes are well placed. Looks are good as well, this clear version is actually more of a &#34;frost&#34; which looks well with a white back, but does darken the color some. I like somewhat &#34;sharp&#34; corners that give it some grip. My only improvement would be more texture on the clear part even more grip. I can't comment on how well it handles drops because I haven't yet. A little hard to stretch on, but that's a good thing in my book. Overall very good for the money.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E8GQEQ6" id="B00E8GQEQ6-review23" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-18:</strong> It took me quite awhile to get used to this case.

The screen protector is thus far the easiest protector I've ever put on (out of about 10 portable devices I've owned in the past couple years).  I still ended up with a few bubbles, but I blame that on myself, not the product!The case is phenominal.  I was looking for something that didn't add too much bulk to my phone yet provided some sort of protection.  The case feels sturdy, but not flimsy.  It's made out of some sort of flexible plastic/rubber material.  Furthermore, after measuring with calipers, the case adds .1 inch to each side.The following measurements without the case:H: 3.59&#34; (9.11cm)W: 1.8&#34; (4.56cm)D: 0.26&#34; (.65cm)With the case, each dimension increased by exactly .1 inch (.26cm).  The only anomaly is that I measured .27cm difference on the depth, as opposed to .26cm on the height and width.The case works with the motorola skip, I have confirmed it on all of my skips and they work great.  All of the buttons still work.  Just note that this case does not add flaps to either the USB port or the headphone jack, so this does not increase water resistance.  It also does not allow for access to the SIM card, you will still need to remove the case to access it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E8GQEQ6" id="B00E8GQEQ6-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-04:</strong> Great case love the look and feel of the protection!

Therefore, I did what any consumer would do and had it replaced by Amazon (Kudos for the service). However, again, 1 week into the 2nd case and the coloration began to fade and due to this I chose to return this case. May be it was the color I purchased (Clear/Gray) but due to this BIG defect, I had to return it for good and go with another case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E8GQEQ6" id="B00E8GQEQ6-review31" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-27:</strong> I like this case. I really do. The protection is provides is awesome. The phone is a little hard to make fit, but the tradeoff is that the phone isn't gonna pop out when it hits the ground. It's extremely sturdy. Also, SUPCASE included the dimple in the design which is really important to me, The dimple is my favorite part of the Moto X's hardware. However... It's uncomfortable to hold due to the sharp edges. The Moto X was designed with one handed use in mind. That said, I usually hold my phone in one hand with my index finger, middle finger, and ring finger supporting the back of my device, while my pinky supports the bottom edge. That's where the problem lies. The bottom edge is hard plastic and the weight of the phone on your pinky really makes it uncomfortable. Due to this I switched to a different case, but I'll keep this one just in case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E8GQEQ6" id="B00E8GQEQ6-review32" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-18:</strong> This is a good and perfectly workable case for the Moto X. I bought this for the clear back plastic to show off my Moto Maker build.THE GOOD:- Clear back plastic lets you see the back of your phone - important if you used Moto Maker- The back plastic is raised enough that you won't scratch your camera by putting your phone down face-up- The side bumper is durable- The Motorola &#34;dimple&#34; is molded into the back plastic, too.THE BAD:- Buttons are difficult to press, especually when the case is new- No feedback when pressing the buttons- Back plastic is frosted, not totally clear - mainly just an aesthetic choice I don't agree with.- Some Micro USB cables don't fit without trimmingThe case is pretty good for the money, but not perfect.

The long cable is a nice touch too.Samsung Galaxy S4</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009L6BYJA" id="B009L6BYJA-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-15:</strong> so far so good, on time, good quality, and elegant and clever.worth the money .will get another one soon</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009L6BYJA" id="B009L6BYJA-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-07:</strong> My wife has it on the bedside for her S3.

That's not as common as it should be.I got this for my wife's Galaxy S4.  She has a thick "wallet-style" case that covers the front and back of the phone.  Very thick leather.  Still, this charge stand allows her to dock the phone with the case cover open or closed.  So, very high marks for convenience.It takes a little bit of jiggery-pokery to assemble the stand; the cord attaches with a very light-weight plastic gizmo and I had concerns about breaking it during assembly (as other reviewers have noted). But I managed to get it together without any incidents.I tried to dock my Note II in this thing, but -- despite the hefty weight of this stand -- that's heart-stoppingly scary; combining the height of this stand, plus the size of the Note II results in a wobbly, Tower of Pisa situation that I wouldn't do on a regular basis.It'd be nice to be able to find a dock for Samsung phones that permitted docking & charging in landscape mode; that would be ideal for bedside Netflix watching, or as an alarm clock, or...  But until I find a landscape-mode charger, this one is very nice.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009L6BYJA" id="B009L6BYJA-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-16:</strong> UPDATE APRIL 19, 2014:I really loved this when I received it.  BUT after one day of use, the charging cable that came with the product quit working.  I didn't know this until the end of the second day when I undocked my phone to leave work and my phone was down to 34%!!!  I fiddled around trying to figure out what was going on and realized the charging cord was not working.  It may have actually damaged my phone, too.  After one day in this charging dock, hardly any of my prior charging cables will work in my phone.I had seen in other reviews that the only thing holding your phone up is the charging pin and after more closely looking at the design, I realize this is true.  I am now wondering if the constant pressure on the charging port messed it up?!?!?I am sending it back for a refund.I just got this today and already I love it.  I have read the other reviews (before I purchased on Amazon) and see the negative points.  This charging dock probably isn't the best for horizontal display.  I like my phone vertical so it is perfect for me.I bought this to use in my office as I have my phone syncing throughout the day with my work calendar, to do lists, etc.  When I first put this together, I tried to use the USB cord that I was already using.  This did not work.  You need to use the USB cord that comes with the kit.I also thought at first that this dock was not very stable.  The phone does rock side to side a tiny bit if wiggled while in the dock which seemed unstable.  But then I tried to just grab it out of the dock to take it with me and it did not come out with one hand.  I had to use two hands and secure the phone to release the dock.  This is nice.  I have another docking station at home that is not this secure.My phone (Galaxy S3) has a double layer shock resistant case on it and it docks fine with the case on.  I don't know what other reviewers are doing that their case doesn't fit.  Maybe if they didn't use the USB cord that came with the unit, that might happen.  When I tried to use a different USB cord, I couldn't even get the phone to match up with the pin.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009L6BYJA" id="B009L6BYJA-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-28:</strong> So after searching and searching for a small alarm doc and ordering one and then returning it, I came across this cute little gadget.

With its unusual shape and variety of colors to choose from, there is sure a match for everyone.It arrived enclosed in a reusable cool hard plastic storage cup.  It was extremely easy to pair with my iPhone 5S and did not require a pin or code.  The included instructions come in several different languages and have a brief summary of how to pair and use the speaker.  Controlling the volume and answering calls are all done via your phone.  The only controls the speakers has is an on/off switch and the outputs for the charging and auxiliary port.  The speaker has two very small LED lights to show the charge and Bluetooth status.Besides using it in Bluetooth mode you can also connect via an auxiliary cable.  Connect your laptops, tablets, MP3 players or anything that has an headphone jack.With so many Bluetooth speakers out in the market today it can be a difficult job to pick one.  The biggest factors to me are audio and visual appeal.  The Modre has got my attention with its stylish good looks, amazingly crystal clear sound and ability to fill a modest size room like a bedroom, kitchen or office with great sound.  The bottom of the speaker has a rubberized ring to keep it from sliding around.Solidly built and has one year warranty.Sample provided for review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EJCTFI8" id="B00EJCTFI8-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-06:</strong> Sound is good, buuuuuuut Had some Bluetooth connectivity issues.

Since one of my speakers came damaged they promptly send me a refund and my new order was sent in less than 2 days - Great!Now about the speaker:This little speaker has good quality and the sound is loud and enjoyable. They are ease to pair, the battery is long lasting, and they are really small so you can bring it with you everywhere you go.Having different brands of Bluetooth speaker under $100 I can classify them in following order:1) Braven 570  - The best sound in the list, open and clear with tight bass and soft treble, the mids are clear and very smooth. You have volume controls, hands free and a USB port to charge your phone in an emergency. Since the controls are in the right side of the speaker you have to get the speaker in your hands to use them. The Bluetooth range is great (30 feet). Price: around $100.2) LePow's Modre -  Good sound, lack a bit of treble and bass, is very portable and has good construction. The only control available is the on/off at the speaker's bottom, you have to use your phone for volume and start hands free. The Bluetooth range is great (30 feet).  Price: around $ 30.3) GoGroove BlueSYNC SRC - The sound is ok, but a little harsh in the treble and lacks some bass.  Easy to pair, the controls works flawless and they are positioned on the speaker top, so they are very easy to access and to use. Price: around $304) Pyle PWPBT60 - The sound is ok, a lot of bass, but the mids and trebles are muffled. Lacks certain openness to the sound. They are sturdy, heavy, but have the worst Bluetooth connection. The connection drops all the time when someone or something is placed between the speaker and the phone, very annoying. The Bluetooth range is very limited. Price: around $70If you want a good sounding speaker that you can carry with you everywhere and don't want spend a lot of money, LePow's is the way to go. They come in a nice pack (a nice cup) with nice cables, they have a great design, very good construction.

Most are OK, but usually leave me wanting more. More bass, more clarity, more battery life, etc. Finally, I've found one with the perfect combination of everything! This Modre is stylish, sounds great, connects easy, and comes in great packaging. And, as an added bonus, the packaging doubles as a bass-booster. As I was listening to the Modre at my desk and admiring the plastic coffee-sippy cup it came in, on a whim I put the speaker back into it's packaging and it made the already good bass response even deeper. Ultimately, this is a solid, well-made product in a sea of mediocrity and yet it's priced very competitively, which makes it a winner in my book.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EJCTFI8" id="B00EJCTFI8-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-29:</strong> This thing is great!  I had a large Sony speaker for my desk at work.  It was big and took up a lot of room, not to mention it wasn't Bluetooth.  It cost me $100 a few years ago.  It was time to upgrade.  This thing runs forever on a single charge!  I have had this for a few months.  I use it for hours on end at work almost everyday and have only charged it a handful of times.  It is so convenient to put some music on and just move the speaker to a far corner of the desk completely out of way.  Not only it this thing super small but it goes pretty loud.  The highs and lows aren't bad at all.

The presentation of this speaker is just great. First of all, it comes not in a box but in a cup. The cup is about 6 inches tall and has a silicone cover that matches the color of the speaker inside.When you open it, you get the speaker, a small instruction sheet, a USB cable and a 3.5mm audio cable. I received this speaker for review purposes.Bluetooth connection is a cinch. I didn't even have to read the instructions. I just turned on the power at the bottom and my smart phone found it right away. Once powered on, the sound is amazing. This speaker is only about 3.5 inches tall but the sound coming from it belies its size. This is one of the few times where form and function come together.

Sure I don't expect this thing to compete with Bose or anything but I have bought less expensive speakers that sounded much better.  After reading the reviews of people who swear by how good this thing is...I have to say I'm not very pleased with it.  I really wanted to like it, when I opened the box I was very happy until I listened to it.  Maybe I have a defective unit.UpdateShortly after receiving this speaker I was asked via email from Lepow about the item.  I shared this review with them and they immediately apologized for my dissatisfaction and offered to send another speaker.  I was so impressed with this kind of customer service that I had to raise my review to 4 stars.  I listened to the new speaker as well.  I still feel the bass could be a little better but I did find a little trick.  If you keep it in the cup it came in it does seem to enhance the sound a little.

So I started looking for speakers, specifically bluetooth speakers.  This speaker produces a nice clear sound, although its size restricts it from producing any measureable bass. Volume is enough to fill a room and is clear even at the highest volume.  This unit paired easily and does not lose connection to the device. My first unit had issues with the bluetooth dropping if you just waved your hand in between the devices.  I contacted Lepow and they shipped me a new one immediately.  They have excellent customer service and I would not hesitate recommending this product to friends and family.  The new Modre does not lose connection and I can make it about 25ish feet without issue.  I havent had the device on long enough to drain the battery as I normally play it while at work at lower volumes and then charge it overnight.  It easily has played 6 hours without losing any quality whatsoever. I love the shape and size of the speaker and it makes a great portable speaker. I chose the green color and its a really great color. I know alot of people love the packaging but for me a normal/smaller carrying bag/case would of been preferred.Some things I am not fond of are that the unit does not have physical buttons to change the volume, or to answer calls.  If you use the speaker during a phone call, people on the other end have issues hearing you unless you speak very loud.  They also say it sounds as though you are in a tunnel.  I didnt buy this speaker for talking on the phone, but since its a selling point, I thought I had to comment on it as well.I have a few other brands of bluetooth speakers coming in, so be sure to check my other reviews in the next week or two.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EJCTFI8" id="B00EJCTFI8-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-25:</strong> This is a cool little bluetooth speaker, and the sound will not disappoint.

I like this speaker; it charges quickly, was easy to pair with our phones, plays great sound, and each charge lasts a long time. Very recommended.The Lepow Modre is much more than just a speaker as we were not only able to listen to great music, but we could use it as a speakerphone to handle incoming calls... all through the mic on the speaker's base! Very cool - well worth purchasing. The unit comes in multiple colors and the one we received was green. It came with a USB power cord that we plugged in to our Samsung phone's wall adapter, and the speaker fully charged in about 1.5 hours as indicated by the red charging light going out.The excellent instructions made it easy to pair with our phones, and pairing was quick and trouble-free with the speaker's voice prompt letting you know when pairing starts ("Pairing") and also when it is completed ("Pairing Completed"). That was a nice touch.  The phone paired with the speaker was always within three to 12 feet of the speaker, typically one to eight feet away, with relatively good line of sight between the two devices. At no time did we experience distortion or loss of volume due to those distances.Tested with my Samsung Galaxy S3 and our teenage son's HTC Droid DNA, the first thing that we noticed was how well this speaker responded to the equalizers on those phones. The DNA has Dre Beats audio on-board, and man-o-man did this speaker rock with that program! When placed on the counter or tabletop, the impact on bass volume and resonance was outstanding.If you would like to see pictures of the speaker that I took, please go back to the speaker's main sales page, scroll down to where the "Most Helpful Customer Reviews" section starts, and look to the right of that area for the "Product Images From Customers" section. It really is a neat looking and great sounding device.We played an eclectic selection including Linkin Park, Everlast, Bob Marley and even a little B.B. King, from sources including Amazon's MP3 Cloud, Pandora and our own audio files. The results were outstanding; with a little tweaking from the equalizers for the different mixes of music, we coaxed the Lepow Modre speaker into producing superb sound for several hours. If I didn't have to concentrate to write this review, I would still be listening to the great tunes right this moment.While enjoying the music, we tested the inbound call capabilities and were impressed by the sound quality of the mic and the speaker during the call. I took a walk outside and placed a call to my son's phone; he answered the call and then spoke with me via the speaker -- and then we switched. Perfect device to use as an impromptu speakerphone!How many times have you purchased electronics and found that the user manual is just worthless? NOT the case here; the manual that comes with this speaker is well written and easy to follow, and has versions in more languages than I have ever seen come with such a device. Glad to see that time and care was put into creating a useful, well written guide.The speaker's retail carton, aka the cup, seems to be a novelty; thought maybe turning it upside down and placing the speaker on top of it would allow some special acoustic properties to shine through... but nope, the speaker sounds best when place on solid furniture.The User manual notes that there is a one year limited manufacturer's warranty, so if an issue arises before that period expires I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I did receive this speaker gratis from the manufacturer, and have put it through the paces to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.If you are looking for a speaker of this style, size and functionality, for use similar to what I have described above, then we highly recommend the Lepow Modre to you. Neat, funky, fun, easy to use, great sounds... really a nice unit.Go for it and enjoy.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EJCTFI8" id="B00EJCTFI8-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-05:</strong> This Lepow Bluetooth speaker has a somewhat quirky design and comes in quirky packaging, too.

However, I prefer the sound quality of the Philips SoundShooter over this device.- Portions of the instructions are in broken English, but it is fairly easy to figure out how to use this device</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EJCTFI8" id="B00EJCTFI8-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-05:</strong> The first thing you notice about the Modre when you open the shipping box is the... odd packaging. It's quirky. It's fun. And highly unique.The Modre comes shipped in a travel style "cup." It's not really a travel mug as the rubber lid has no opening for liquid, but you can remove the sticker from the cup and all the packaging, give it a good wash and have a perfectly usable cup to go with your Modre. This kind of solution is quite brilliant in my mind, as if the person who receives the Modre keeps the cup, that's kept some worthless packing material out of the land fill or recycle bin. Of course, it will eventually need to be tossed, but in a few years I would hope, meaning you really are making a small difference.Anyway, the packing is brilliant. Hands down.The other things that stands out to me is the design of the speaker. I've tried out many... way too many... Bluetooth speakers. Each sounds OK and each has some unique design cue to it. The Modre is the first that seems to be designed with the thought of true 360 degree music. I can confirm, by dancing around the speaker as it blares my music that the experience is, pretty much, the same in front as it is from behind the speaker.The performance itself is about what I've come to expect from a BT speaker. It sounds OK. It's not audiophile quality, and if that's what you are looking for in this price range you are deluding yourself for sure (it won't happen). Instead, if you lower your standards a tiny bit, you can jump into the Modre and enjoy truly portable, easily portable as the weight is minimal, BT audio from your speakers.It also includes a mic so that you can use the Modre as a speaker phone. My only complaint is that there are no controls on the device to answer the phone or change volume. That's a minor complaint given the performance and fun level.I used BT, which was simple to connect to my Lumia 1020 and my iPhone (don't ask why I have 2 phones). I also plugged the speaker into my computer using the line out. Sound is good out of the box. If you want a deeper bass experience, or tighter treble, plug the speaker into your computer or connect it via BT to your computer and use a program, such as J River Media Center, that allows you to do custom EQ. After EQ the sound is quite good. And no, I don't expect EQ capability on a portable speaker at this price, just pointing out that a little EQ can go a long way.Overall:I am quite happy with the Modre. The packaging is silly, quirky and fun. This is the first time I've mentioned PACKAGING in a speaker review for a BT speaker.Performance, for the price, is quite nice. With a little EQ, you get a great sound but unfortunately not all phones off that kind of capability.With the ability to plug the included 2.5mm plug into a device that doesn't have BT support, you can still enjoy the sound from the Modre and your chosen device.Highly recommended.I received a free sample from the manufacturer for review purposes.  I would NOT hesitate to spend money on a Lepow product.

It allows either vertical or horizontal positioning, and the cord connection from the Droid X clears the mounting and holding ears perfectly.The unit rattles LOUDLY when the phone is out of the holder....but to stop it all you have to do is close the holding tabs (as if the phone was in the unit).

I coupled this with a 90 degree angle microUSB power adapter for my Samsung Galaxy S3 and I have a very nice in car GPS.

There was 2 problems I had with it.  First, if you are renting a car, you don't want to glue the disc that mounts to the dash on a rental and without that and laws that prevent windshield suction use, most cars don't have a place to suction such a device.  Second, If you use almost any kind of case with your phone, that green stick to won't stay stuck to.  This item solves both those problems.  The weighted part can be used in almost any dash and is easily just lifted when done so can be used in multiple vehicles.  It ratchets closed on your phone so it will not fall off and releases with a button.  It also comes with one of those stick on disc that you can use in your on vehicle for a more permanent place to suction if you choose and just take the waited pad with you when you travel.  This is a great item.  I use it with a Note 2 so it will fit a large phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003WITNXC" id="B003WITNXC-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-11-22:</strong> I was concerned the Note would be too big for these mounts but tried this model because the top part was unhindered.

It has a good grip on the dash, does not slide, but vibrate a little. If you already have a Garmin Dashboard Friction Mount for your GPS, do not expect the same, since that is specifically designed for such device. But for a universal dash friction stand, probably it is the best you can find. Be aware that the bottom of the friction stand is firm & does not shape to the surface of your dash, like Garmin that made like sand bag & molds to the shape of your dash. So you get the best out of this, if the surface of your dash is flat without any curves.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003WITNXC" id="B003WITNXC-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-27:</strong> Bought this for my Galaxy S (Vibrant) with hopes of using the phone in my car more for streaming music and GPS.This worked great in my wife's car, but not in mine, as I don't really have a flat surface on my dash.  The curves of the dash made the friction mount wobble a bit and not be as sturdy as I'd like.  Plus, the friction pad was a bit bigger than I was expecting (not that it's a bad thing, I guess I didn't expect it to be that substantial).The windshield mount, however, worked great on the windshield (it also stayed securely on the friction pad).  It has a bunch of different settings that allow you to easily change the angle/direction of your phone.  It fits the phone very snug and I never worried about its security.Overall I think this would work great for many people, but just didn't work out for me.  I've stopped using it in my car and now use the windshield mount as a phone dock in my office (attached to a window).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B003WITNXC', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B003WITNXC', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B0071G0KR4</h2>    <p class="price"> $B0071G0KR4</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

So turned it in and exchanged it for the Razr Maxx.  What a GREAT decision.  This phone holds a charge all day long (8+ hours) with heavy use.  With light use while studing for an exam, I timed it and it lasted 74 HOURS before recharging!  ARE YOU KIDDING ME???!!!  NO!!!!!!!  That is the ABSOLUTE TRUTH!  Never even heard of a smartphone lasting 2 days, let alone 3!  And my previous 2 smartphones I added extended batteries to them but none lasted this long.  I suspect Motorola has optimized the software with the imbedded extended battery for primo extended use.  Have owned this phone for a few months now and have not regreted it at all.

I've been on Android for four years, and I love it, and ICS is new to me with this phone. It's made some interesting, unexpected improvements over Gingerbread. But it's still Android, and performs as such (ie, well).This review is basically about the battery. Which is insane.My last phone was a Droid X running Gingerbread. Most days I didn't need to charge my phone until I went to bed at night, but I definitely needed to charge at night. Some days I'd come home from work and my battery would be just about dead (and die before I charged it at bedtime). Some days, if I was really hammering at it, I would need to charge during the day. This had become normal for me, and was only rarely a problem.The Maxx? I mean, I use it a lot, but I can't seem to kill the battery. One night, shortly after I got it, it was down to 30 or 40 percent when I was going to bed, so I played a graphics heavy game for a while, trying to kill it. After an hour of play, I backed out of the game to check my power level-- I had barely done any damage at all. Perhaps I should have tried downloading something at the same time.Yesterday I didn't use it much-- and I had it plugged in while I was using the navigation-- and 12 hours after leaving the house I was still at 100%. Any other phone I've had would have dropped some power in the interim, from processes and whatnot, but not this.Why all phones can't do this yet is beyond me. But this is magical, and now I look at other people's Android powered phones that are down to 20% battery at the end of the day and mock them with my 60%.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0071G0KR4" id="B0071G0KR4-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-21:</strong> I upgraded to the Razr Maxx from the HTC Droid Incredible and could not be happier. All the reasons why I am completely satisfied with this phone: Large, crystal clear display; very responsive; 4G is excellent; no dropped calls; loud and clear sound; many great pre-installed apps; swype feature on keyboard is amazing and makes texting easy and fast; numerous ringtone options, far more to choose from than previous phones; solid build; gorilla glass is wonderful; battery life is quite extensive, allowing me to charge my phone about every 4 days with normal use, and every 2 or 3 days with heavier use; connects quickly to wi-fi when in range; recent upgrade shows all settings in living color; syncs with my Xoom and PC quickly and easily;  and numerous others as you will experience for yourself. All in all, I am a big fan of the Motorola Razr Maxx and would highly recommend this phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0071G0KR4" id="B0071G0KR4-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-26:</strong> I have had two motorola phones and two iPhones before purchasing the Droid Razr Maxx. I had the Droid X and Droid X2. Both were good phones, but battery life wasn't the greatest and I wanted something more than Gingerbread had to offer. So, from there I bought the iPhone 4 and eventually the iPhone 4S. Battery life on those wasn't the best and iOS did not have the same functionality of Ice Cream Sandwich.The Droid Razr Maxx has been my favorite smartphone to date.Pros:-Superb battery life: It easily lasts me all day. I watch a lot of video on it, so I have to charge it every night. However, I don't have to charge it midday like I had to for my iPhone 4S.-Ice Cream Sandwich: Android 4.0 running on the Maxx is one of the least customized versions of Android. The slight tweaks that Motorola has made generally improve the use of the device.-MicroSD card slot: It seems as if the microSD card slot is disappearing. It is nice to see Motorola included it on the Maxx.-Excellent Call Quality: I get excellent Verizon coverage where I live, so my device has no problem keeping connected. Calls are quite good.Cons:-Bloatware: Verizon has loaded this device with bloatware. Thankfully, most of it can be either removed or disabled.-Screen: qHD resolution is a bit disappointing coming from the retina display on the iPhone. When viewing the screen up close, you can distinguish the individual pixels. Being Super AMOLED, bright colors are very vibrant. However, some colors appear washed out, such as skin tone. In direct sunlight, the screen is barely visible even with brightness at 100%. Overall, the screen isn't the best, but it is usable.-Rear camera: Motorola's camera technology has not changed much since the Droid X. The camera takes pretty good outdoor shots, but struggles in low-light situations.Overall, the Droid Razr Maxx is a decent device. I would definitely recommend it to someone looking for a relatively low cost phone with the superb battery life. If money is not an issue, get the Droid Razr Maxx HD.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0071G0KR4" id="B0071G0KR4-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-09:</strong> My phone got drenched while it was in my pocket at a concert.

The phone is basically the same phone as the Droid Razr but with a massively extended battery. That's important as the battery cannot be changed out to an extended batter on the Droid Razr and this phone gets the extended battery punch but still in the same slim form factor. This is the slimmest Smartphone still.Droid Razr and Razr Maxx have:+The fastest 4G LTE network. I'll routinely get 15-20 MBPS download and sometimes even better upload. This means almost no lag, super fast downloads and instant page loads on browsers. In case you aren't in a 4G LTE area, you still get the EVDO 3G network and the 1xRTT CDMA digital calling networks.+Verizon's voice network (still the best.)+Verizon's #1 customer service (just won J.D. Power's for second straight year.)+The new battery can get you more than a full day of full usage without constant charging, unlike almost every other 4G Smartphone and many other 3G Smartphones.+If you are looking for slim this is the slimmest Smartphone out.+Water-Resistent insides and coating. You may be able to walk through light rain without worrying. (I won't do that, but you probably could with this one.)+Gorilla Glass screen is way tougher than standard glass.+32 GB memory is more than enough for a ton of app downloads and music on your device. 16 GB is on a micro-SD and you could swap that out to 32.+Dual Core 1.2 GHz processors really make a difference on running multiple apps at the same time. I can run half a dozen memory eating processes at any time and swap back and forth. I also run as many as 6 or more tabs on my browser with no slow down (either FireFox or Dolphin HD.)+Motorola's UI is clean and easy to customize. It isn't as slick as HTC's Sense UI, but it also isn't clunky like LG's UI. It gives some extras that are helpful (widgets for social networking, for instance,) without getting in the way.-Kevlar back is more for looks than useful in my opinion. Unless you're James Bond and plan on carrying 30 of these under your shirt...-The weight of the phone makes it feel cheap to me. It is super light and the material isn't solid feeling like the Droid Bionic or even an iPhone.-No Ice Cream Sandwich (yet).Some people may balk at the $300 price tag, but the phone is smarter than most people's home PCs and you'll carry it with you almost every day, every where you go. Why wouldn't you think $300 is a good value for a device like that?Overall, this is a great Droid 4G LTE phone. The battery and processors make this phone the fastest and longest lasting of the Droid devices.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0071G0KR4" id="B0071G0KR4-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-13:</strong> I returned two samsung Galaxy nexus to finally settle down on Droid Razr Maxx.I believe everybody has different expectations from cell phones.What i liked in Droid Razr Maxx:1) Excellent batter life. It can last my overall 2.5 hours of commute, surfing during office hours and even after heavy use can go for around 7-8 hours...atleast 3-4 hours continuously i can talk using this. I want a basic phone first and not just a good looking one(Samsung Galaxy Nexus).2) Very good voice quality compared to Galaxy Nexus.3) Very good speaker compared to Galaxy Nexus.4) Consistent and strong signal compared to Galaxy Nexus.5) Max Storage will be 16GB(internal) + 32 GB(external SD Card) compared to 32 GB of Samsung Galaxy NexusWhat i like in Samsung Galaxy Nexus compared to Motorola Droid Razr Maxx:1) You will fall in love with 720p Vs 540(Razr) resolution and slightly bigger screen(4.65 Vs 4.3)2) Android Ice Cream Sandwitch is far ahead of GingerBread-very easy and intuitive...but don't worry Razr Maxx owners-we will get it within next 6 months...3) Applications like Gmail is far better on Samsung Galaxy Nexus(i think may be because of ICS). Moreover i didn't like the unwanted Motorola apps that comes by default with the phone.I don't feel Galaxy Nexus appears cheap...but some of the basics - Samsung, Google and Verizon should have sorted out before launching...you can't sell a cell phone and expect customers to keep their chargers in pocket and search for charging station....and also loose signal as well as calls(yes-it's hard to hear it's ring and speaker sound is too low).But i am disappointed with Motorola-why there is a delay in ICS upgrade? Why the PPI is so low compared to Apple iPhone 4S and Samsung Galaxy Nexus? Why so much Motorola Crap applications?In the end - i was Black Berry user for around 5 yeas(my old company phone) and then switched to Smartphones. No doubt - Apple iPhone is the best hardware and ICS is the best mobile O/S. Apple iPhone 5 should be having 4" screen with 1080p resolution, 4G network ready, battery like Droid Razr Maxx and a lot of features that for the remaining 2013 - all other phone makers will try to follow the standard(Apple iPhone 5).Revising the review:I think as of now Motorola Droid Razr Maxx is the best Smart phone available for Verizon Customers who would like to enjoy the fast speed of 4G/LTE network. It's battery is the biggest selling point-with a heavy use - almost 2.5 to 3 hr of commute it can last for at least 7-9 hours with one single charge. I am just hoping to get Android ICS update asap. ICS is far better than Gingerbread.Used it for 3 weeks now...no issues in terms of battery...last at least 8 hours with moderate to heavy use-quite satisfied...one of the reasons to return back Galaxy Nexus was due to battery drainage.I purchased chargers(Wall and Car) of Motorola Droid Razr and they are working with Motorola Droid Razr Maxx.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0071G0KR4" id="B0071G0KR4-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-22:</strong> Bought this phone as an upgrade for my wife,after years of service from a great Blackberry Tour 9630,problem free.Read MANY reviews on MANY phones and decided to go forward with this particular model,mainly due to battery life and screen size.Phone arrived in a timely fashion,after charging only took a few minutes to get it up and running,4G is quick,as is WiFi,3G is constant and reasonably quick. Plenty of memory on this aswell.Unsure how good gorilla glass and kevlar are and how long they will last,only time will tell as one reviewer stated phone dropped on carpet and broke,so will see.Initially the transition from a RIM phone to the Android market there was some head scratching but my wife figured it out pretty quick,she found the app for ringtones PDQ,along with others,not sure what,but I know she has loaded it up!!Nice screen size,great cameras front and back and seems reliable,its used alot for voice,text,email and Internet and the battery seems to keep pace(I know this as there have been no complaints from my good lady)...........there is also a good deal of accesories for this phone,including a plug for the headphone jack so you can attach charms(my wife likes them) if thats your thing.Also a few good leather cases/holsters that will accomodate this large phone in its PROTECTOR CASE, that was a big thing for my wife.Cant really give any technical data on this phone as I a 'challenged'with these.Sorry if this review doesnt give you much help,all I can say is it seems to be a good phone,is big,has a good sized screen and at this time,performs as expected.***Update*** still working great,found an app from mytinyphone.com download this to your phone and you can customise your ringtones,text tones etc,from a few second noise to full songs,wallpapers etc,nearly all of 100's of 1000's for free.Works well with this phone and numerous other android phones.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0071G0KR4" id="B0071G0KR4-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-06:</strong> Due to service quality & customer servce issues I was having with Sprint, I sold my Motorola Photon 4G and moved to Verizon Wireless.  So far so Good!Motorola Razr Maxx------------------I was tired of poor to mediocre battery life that has become the norm for most Android phones, so I deciced to pay a little extra and get the Razr Maxx.  As a business user who travels often, I have come to appreciate the "Extra Juice" they put into this device!Pros:-----+ Build quality is rock solid - This is probably due in part that, like Apple, Motorola chose to lock the battery in the deivce. Weight and size feel great+++ Gorilla Glass and Kevlar back are a nice combination!+ Battery Life (Yes it's for real, and it is awsome!.  This device holds its own and even surpasses the Iphone in batery life (both standby and talk time)+ Much improved screen (Super AMOLED + has crystal clear text and solid blacks, overall great contrast level)+ Learning to apprecaite the simple things (i.e. how screen goes dark when you put next to your ear and turns back on when you move it away)+ OS is smooth and fast.  I have never been a big fan of Motoblur, but it is zippy and works well.  Menus are easy to navigate and customize.+ Sound quality, both talking and speaker itself is very good.  There was a noticable improvement from my Photon 4G from Sprint+ Upgradable to Ice Cream Sandwitch (This will be happening very soon)  Great that Google owns Motorola's wireless division, should make for quick OS updates+ Signal Strength is very good both for voice and data+ Speakerphone is excellentWhile this phone has a lot of fetures that make it highly recommended, there are some things I think it can improveCons:------ Appearence is fairly generic Android, not that necessarily is a bad thing- Screen quality while great, is not in the same league as the Galaxy Nexus, both in resolution and color saturation.  I would have liked a true HD display- Not a big fan of the tray door that holds the Sim & Memory card.  I had to reinstall the 16GB memory card when I recieved the phone because it did not find it at first- Motoblur (or whatever they call it now) still is behind the curve compared to HTC Sense(In My Opinion)- Camera is very good, but colors seem slightly muted.Overall, I feel that Motorola has delivered a near perfect phone for both the business and personal user.  I personally apprecaite the battery life which I definitly feel is worth the extra investment over the standard Razr.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0071G0KR4" id="B0071G0KR4-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-01:</strong> I was hanging on to my 3G Droid X because just about all the 4G phones recently released had mediocre battery life even with their extended batteries. When the Razr Maxx was announced, it immediately caught my attention. As soon as I saw it in the Verizon Store, I was hooked. It's hard to believe how they squeezed a 3300mAh battery into a phone this thin. Not only is the phone still very thin, it actually feels better in my hand than the standard Razr Maxx. As for it's performance, I find it excellent all around. Call quality is excellent. Radio reception is very good. The phone does come with Android 2.3 Gingerbread which is a disappointment, but Android 4.0 ICS should be right around the corner. The usual "Motoblur" UI is still there too, but it's not as bad as in the past. The phone also comes with some unwanted bloatware, but supposedly it can all be removed if wanted when Android 4.0 comes out. The rear camera takes very good pictures in good light, and fair at best pictures indoors under poor light. I've taken a few seconds of test video, but from what I can tell, it is good. The 4.3-inch Super AMOLED screen is in my opinion very good. I've seen some mixed reviews on it, and I'm sure there are better displays out there, but I have no problem with it. It's bright. Text is clear, and colors are accurate. Battery life is excellent, and even better than expected. I've gone 2 days of moderate to heavy usage, and I still have 40% left. Amazing. All in all, I totally love the DROID RAZR MAXX, and highly recommend it. It's not totally perfect, but comes as close as any phone I've ever owned.Pros:Spectacular battery life.Excellent call quality.Very good radio reception.Very fast 4G LTE data performance.Thin and lightweight.Dual-core 1.2 GHz processor.16GB internal memory, and 16GB microSD card included.Cons:No Android 4.x ICS yet.Phone takes up to 3 hours to fully charge.Mediocre camera performance in poor light.qHD 540x960 display might disappoint some.------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 6/23/12:I just received the Android 4.04 ICS update. An already great phone just got better. The phone seems faster, and you can either uninstall or disable most of the included bloatware.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0071G0KR4" id="B0071G0KR4-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-14:</strong> I've just left a Galaxy Nexus and had a Droid X before that plus iPhones. The Razr Maxx is absolutely the best phone I've ever owned. There's a lot that's not stated in the specs. Of course it has an amazing battery but it's not just the battery. Motorola has tweaked the phone so that it uses less juice. I installed a 3800mah extended battery in the Nexus and it still didn't last half as long as the Razr Maxx so it's not just the battery size, it's the tweaks to the phone so that it consumes less power while performing better. Everyone knows about the battery but there are a couple of other big plusses.The second big plus (in addition to the long lasting battery) is the reception. In the same spot, the Razr Maxx sounds clear whereas the Nexus either drops the call or is choppy. I've verified this in several places. The Razr Maxx's reception ability is miles beyond any other phone. It's worth it just to keep from sounding bad and dropping calls. BIG plus but it's under reported.The third thing are the Smart Actions that are built-in. They replace an app called Timeriffic but they work better without jamming the phone. You can set your phone to turn on wifi at a preset location, turn off the ringer at preset times, etc. I have regular meetings and church so now my phone goes into vibrate mode at those times without me having to remember to set it. I usually wanted vanilla android but not any more. I like the Motorola skin and tweaks much better and I've had no jams whereas vanilla seemed less stable on the Nexus.It's waterproof. There's a youtube video that shows the Maxx immersed in a bathtub for 20 seconds with NO damage. Now I don't worry about being caught in the rain while jogging. Scratch proof glass, tough phone, super reception, unreal battery endurance, great tweaks. etc.PLUS it's got GSM capability built-in so when I travel out of the U.S. my phone works on the world GSM networks. My brother has a Maxx also and both of us have owned the high tech phones since the Treos. We've never been this giddy with a phone. Rarely are we over pleased but the Razr Maxx has gone way beyond our expectations and the hype. You won't regret this phone. Ever!If I could give it over five stars I would make this a ten star review and rating.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0071G0KR4" id="B0071G0KR4-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-20:</strong> Battery life has been the Achilles Heel of smart phones.With my previous phones, I had to carry my charger wherever I went. With my Incredible, I even carried a spare battery AND an external backup battery- in addition to the charger.  Having an extended battery often meant having an awkward bulky hump on the back as well as a severe weight penalty. But Motorola has gotten it right with this one. The phone is still very slim and only slightly heaver than the standard razr, yet has battery life that truly lasts all day. In the first few days with it, I turned everything on and left it that way all day- Bluetooth, WiFi, GPS- something I never would have done with previous phones. I enabled all of my apps to update as often as they see fit. I even chose an active wallpaper. I have spent many hours installing apps, pulling music down to the phone via Subsonic, Watching YouTube videos, configuring the home screens, reading a couple of chapters of a book on the Kindle app, streaming music via Bluetooth to my stereo- pretty much the better part of a Saturday using the heck out of the phone without ever plugging it in. The battery was only just above 50% by the time I went to bed. Most of the use I just outlined would have required me to have the Incredible plugged in the whole time.Overall, I am very happy with the rest of the capabilities of this phone. It is fast and has quite a bit of internal storage, however I'm not sure I like how the storage is partitioned. The "sdcard" you see in the file system is actually a partition within the internal memory (about 8GB). The sdcard slot you can load shows up as sdcard-ext. Not many apps can map data to this, so that 32GB class 10 card I just bought won't do much for me except hold pictures and music. All of the application storage - and apps that you move to the "sdcard" will actually remain internal. That class 10 I just paid a premium for won't actually do much to boost phone performance, since I am stuck with whatever speed memory is built in. But when I look over the sdcard of my previous phone, the majority of my sdcard utilization was actually music and video, so maybe that 8gb storage limitation won't be that big of a deal.My only other complaint might be the fact that it is still so thin as to make it slightly uncomfortable to hold. But the good news is that when in a case, it is just about right. I went with the Seidio Active case (Seidio BD2-HK3MTRMK-BK ACTIVE Combo with Metal Kickstand for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Black) with the holster. The last Seidio case I had was the first case I've had to outlast the phone. The Active case on the Razr makes the phone very comfortable to hold, adds lots of protection, and has a fold out kickstand on the back. An added bonus is that instead of having a cutout for the power and volume buttons, Sedio built it into the rubber of the inner case- so you actually have an easier to locate rubber button over the actual button, which works very well.Until more phones have batteries on par with the MAXX, I can't see having chosen any other phone - even if some others boast more pixel count (I'm dubious about the necessity of HD resolutions on such a small screen- especially if all that resolution requires more processing power and more battery usage). Sure you can get extended batteries for other phones, but this one beats most others on thickness and weight in stock form. It is well worth the price premium in my opinion.Now, if we could just speed up the LTE roll out in my area...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0071G0KR4" id="B0071G0KR4-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-22:</strong> I've had this phone for about 4 months now (upgraded from a Blackberry Tour), and I must say, the functionality is incredible.  Let's start off with some of the basic concerns:Battery:  Never had an issue with battery life.  I'm a rather "light" to "medium" user, but I've participated in 3-hour phone calls for work and other high-demand applications with no problems.  Standby life is extraordinary - unplugged it from the charger at 9 a.m. one Saturday but didn't use it at all.  Went to bed at midnight, and the battery was at 87%.  Has a built-in Task Manager app so you can see which applications are draining your battery.  Also includes "Smart Actions" that monitors battery life and makes adjustments accordingly (e.g., by dimming the display screen).Connectivity & call quality:  I live in a rural area (3G coverage only), but have never been without service and never dropped a call (on my Blackberry and other devices, it would drop calls along roads that ventured into "dead zones" within the county).  I haven't had that issue since upgrading.  When I go to town, it automatically connects to 4G service, and when it detects a wifi signal (either from my own home network or public wifi), it also connects.  Call volume and clarity, both ear and speaker, are excellent; I've never had issues with others not being able to understand me, even while outside on windy days.GUI:  Love the customizable 5 home screens - the apps I use most frequently are only a couple swipes away (no hunting through menus to find your music player or an email).  You can have a home screen dedicated to music, one for social networking, one for pics & videos, and one for (of course) the telephone and contacts.Touch screen: Upgrading from the QWERTY keyboard on the Blackberry, I was skeptical about the touch screen (big, beefy "guy" fingers).  I honestly have had no issue with it.  It is very responsive, and I have no issues selecting icons.  Besides, for every app that requires text entry (email, web search, text, etc.), it has a voice command feature.  Additionally, the screen is very bright and vivid, even at the lowest brightness setting.  A word of warning -- DO NOT use a privacy screen with this phone!!!  Privacy screens make the display very dim, especially while outside (and forget it if you're wearing sunglasses).  The dim display will compell you to turn your display brightness to maximum to see through the privacy screen.  This can cause screen burn-in, and you'll notice ghostly images of your home screen icons forever.Operating system:  I've read a few reviews about crashes & freezing, but this hasn't been a problem for me.  I try to remember to shut the phone down weekly (you have to treat the phone like a computer & can't leave it on ALL the time!)...  I've had a couple instances of the system locking up, but after a force reboot (hold power button & down volume button for 5 seconds), the system restarts just fine.  Both internal data and SD data can be accessed easily via the My Files app on the phone or via Windows Explorer.  I use the phone as an external hard drive for work... except the phone connects to my desktop quicker than my external hard drive...  There is also a Motocast app so I can access any file (music, pic, video, Microsoft Office, etc.)that is on my PC via the phone (as long as the PC is on & has an internet connection).  I can also print a document or email from the phone to my home printer (or work printer once set up).Camera:  Photos taken outside are incredible.  Indoor photos not so much.  My primary complaint with the camera is there is no way (that I've discovered) to change image resolution.  That photo you took to put on FaceBook winds up being 2 megabytes. Indoor photos can be grainy and out of focus.  I have not experimented with the front-facing camera yet...Apps:  Countless free apps available out there for the things not already on the phone.  It's just a matter of finding the app that works best for you.  For example, there are two music player apps preloaded on the phone, but I prefer the functionality of a third party music app.  Several GPS apps (Goodbye, Garmin!), Social Localization, You Tube, Kindle & Google Books preinstalled, etc. etc. etc.  And for every app that's already on the phone, there are two or three alternatives available from the Play store (you're not stuck using Verizon Navigator, Verizon Videos, Vcast ringtones, etc.).Strength:  Unit feels solid and robust; I've dropped it a couple of times, but there's not even a scratch on it.  The battery compartment is sealed, so you don't have to worry about the phone flying one way and the battery going the other if you drop it.  The display glass feels very firm and does not deflect - pushing on some touch screens, the screen tends to yield under finger pressure and you can see pixel discoloration where your finger is.  The screen on the Razr does not do this and seems to say, "Your finger ain't got nothing on my screen."  After 4 months, aside from my fingerprints, the phone still looks brand new.In summary, this is a very powerful phone that exceeded my expectations and meets most of my needs (it can start my car, but it won't wash it for me...)  I'm discovering more functionality and features every day, even after 4 months.  The screen burn-in and camera quality are my only complaints, but they don't come close to eclipsing the other qualities of the device.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0071G0KR4" id="B0071G0KR4-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-12:</strong> I replaced an original Droid with the RAZR Maxx.  I really like the phone and would recommend it.  Even with the larger battery the phone is still super thin and I would not recomend the Droid RAZR as you won't notice the thickness but you will notice the battery life.PROS:- Battery, battery, battery - Can pretty much use it all day with GPS, Bluetooth, Wifi and everything else turned on and not run out of battery.- Comes with Swype delivered- Screen is bright and clear- Love the internal battery - one less door to deal with and allows the phone to be thinner than with a replaceable battery.- Smart Actions are great - There are apps in Google Play that do the same thing but this app has a better and more intuitive interface.- Comes with a messaging app that is better than stock Android as it allows a consolidated inbox (Gmail, corporate, other)- External Storage Card - Comes with a 16GB card.  Replaced that with a 32GB card and I have all my music on the phone (great for plane rides and no need to use bandwidth to play music).- The home row of 4 buttons can be customized (mostly, see below) to have whatever apps you want appear on every page.- 4G LTE is lightning fast.CONS:- Crapware - this phone comes with so much useless junk apps that cannot be uninstalled that I cannot begin to count them.  Luckily with 3GB of app storage it doesn't create memory issues.- Its slippery - sides are glossy and rounded so it could easily slip out of my hand.  Will be getting a rubberized case- Its hard to use with 1 hand and I wear a men's large glove- The bezel around the screen is wide.  I would have preferred the phone to be slightly thicker and have a smaller bezel making the height/width less and easier to handle and hold.- Dislike the Motorola OS overlay (MotoBlur or whatever its called).- The Application app (used to access the apps) is locked into the home row.  It cannot be removed.- Finicky Wifi (see note below).- No ICS (but should be coming ... hopefully without MotoBlur)- Included charging cord is only 3' long and is 2 piece (plug with 2 USB ports and USB cord).Additional Note:  When I set up the phone to access my Wifi it initially had problems.  I downloaded Wifi Analyzer (great app) from Google Play and found that every 2 seconds the signal would decrease to 0 and then come right back.  To fix this I had to set my router to broadcast the SSID (before I had it hidden) and this fixed the issue.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0071G0KR4" id="B0071G0KR4-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-03:</strong> I am so tired of manufacturers continuing to add bigger, brighter, higher density screens, and not paying a bit of attention to battery life.  It's insane to have a phone that does so many things, but you can't use them after a year, because the battery drains before you get home from work.I have been staying away from smartphones because of this.  I have always purchased old Nokias from ebay so I don't have to worry about charging my phone EVERY day.Until now.  This is a great phone with all the features of it's counterparts, but with a HUGE battery.  Quite honestly, I would put up an 12mm phone if I could get a 6000mah battery.Pros:- I get 2-4 days(depending on use) without having to charge it.-- NOTE: I ACTIVELY manage the battery.- SmartActions is cool because it allows you to automate/manage your phone features.- Otherwise, its the same as most other Android phones.Cons:- A little slow to update to ICS, which they have promised.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0071G0KR4" id="B0071G0KR4-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-05:</strong> I have owned the Droid Razr Maxx for two weeks now.  I have owned it long enough to know that I love it.  I owned an iPhone 4 for more than a year.  Prior to getting the phone, I had owned an old standard phone without Internet.  When one of my co-workers first showed me the iPhone and what it could do, I could not believe it and I went out and purchased one the next day without even investigating other phones.  When I first got it, I loved it.  It was amazing, almost like having a computer in your pocket.  I was in love with the phone.  Then, over time, as I started using the phone more to go to various websites, I realized that many websites that I was going to had blank spots where there were supposed to be pictures, or the sites did not work at all.  I just assumed that it was not possible to view these sites on a smart phone.  I thought it was a limitation of the technology.  Then when some of my students would show me their smart phones, I noticed that they were able to view the same websites that I was not.  I wondered why that was, and what was in common between all those phones that could view those websites was that they were not iPhones.  I came to realize that Apple does not allow flash player on their iPhones, or their iPads for that matter.  This upset me quite a bit.  I read Steve Jobs' explanation in a long letter that he posted online.  It seems to me that he simply had a fight with Adobe, who makes the flash player, and therefore refuses to allow it on the phones or iPads.  He says in the letter that flash player makes the phones crash and so on, but the moral to this story is that I did get an Android phone a couple of weeks ago and I can tell you that the phone has not crashed a single time.  It is VERY nice to be able to browse the Internet unhindered and view pretty much whatever site you want to view, without blank pages or blank spots showing up on the page.  Consumers should be told prior to purchasing the iPhone that they do not allow flash player and thus you will not be able to see a significant number of sites that you would be able to view on other phones.  The Android experience has been much more like a true computer/internet experience.  Some other frustrating things about the iPhone are that you cannot open, edit, or create Word files, again because it is an Apple phone and they will not permit you use the Microsoft product.  On my Droid phone, I am able to open, create and edit Word and Excel files, then easily send them as attachments to emails.  Most other phones also have a MUCH larger screen than the iPhone.  The iPhone's screen is so small that it is quite difficult to maneuver around, and trying to type on the incredibly small keyboard is very haphazard and often results in typos.  Then to add insult to injury, the auto correct feature on the iPhone is terrible, just awful really.  I had many times sent texts out that the auto correct feature changed a word that I had typed correctly, corrected to the wrong word, and made me look stupid.  So I would quickly re-type the word and send it again, thinking that I had corrected the mistake, only to find out that it did not correct it at all and it again corrected to the wrong word, again making me look stupid, and I would try again with the same result.  No joke, the auto correct feature and the keyboard are SO BAD on the iPhone that this sometimes went on 5 times as I would fight the auto correct feature to get the right word to go out in my text, with 4 idiotic versions going out in a row.  We would of course make a joke out of it, but it is just so stupid.  It does not have to be like this and the Droid Razr Maxx that I purchased does not have this problem at all.  In fact, it has never auto-corrected a word to the wrong word and better yet, it helps you to find the correct word by giving you about 10 options of possibilities that you can click on.  This helps you to send out better texts that make you look smart, not stupid.  In addition, the Android phone that I have allows you to print out directly from the phone to your printer at home wirelessly, without need to buy one of Apple's printers.  I splurged for a Droid Razr Maxx due to the improved battery on top of everything else that I talked about.  The Droid Razr Maxx has an incredible battery that can go at least one day without ever having to recharge.  I also love using the FREE Google Maps Navigator as a GPS.  It has turn by turn instructions with satellite view, current traffic updates, and estimated time of arrival, and all for free.  This free application is better than the GPS in my car.  The traffic is more up to date and the satellite view and estimated time of arrival are incredible.  The ONLY negative I have found about the phone is that it is a bit large, which can make it slightly difficult for someone with small hands to use one hand to browse. But the large size is also what makes the browsing experience so much better.  I could tell MANY other things about what the Droid phone can do that the iPhone can't but this would go on forever.  I would highly recommend the Droid Razr Maxx if you have the money, otherwise the Droid Razr would be an excellent choice as well.  The Droid Razr Maxx is ranked number 1 by Consumer Reports and the Droid Razr is ranked number 2.  I am very happy that I purchased a Droid Razr Maxx.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0071G0KR4" id="B0071G0KR4-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-18:</strong> This phone comes w/ an appstore which you must use to find all the fundamental things you would expect from a smart phone.

It upgraded to ICS shortly after turning it on (permission required).  Apparently some people who have had this phone for awhile have had difficulty with bugs since the ICS upgrade.  I have not had a single one and suspect this is because I did not add apps until the update was completed.  I have been using an HTC EVO 4G on Sprint for the past 18 months.  Sprint changed the contract twice during that time period (giving less for the same price).  One of the reasons I had chosen the EVO was the ability to add on the hotspot with unlimited data--Sprint severely restricted data in May and, despite giving three ways to find out your usage, there was no way to know usage until they send you a message that you had reached your maximum allowable (the message itself pushed you over the allowed data).  In mid-June the Sprint network started dropping calls in downtown Chicago and, after many calls to Customer Service (also to restore 4G service which mysteriously would become unavailable without calling them--dropping calls requiring several tries to complete--only to have it revert to 3G shortly afterwards) and they eventually admitted to having two cell towers down.  This problem persisted through all of July at which time I gave up on Sprint.  The RAZR MAXX solves the hotspot problem without any extra charges.  The ability to clear items from the notification screen is a great feature.  The only criticism I have is that, so far, Verizon Wireless has not allowed customers to use Google Wallet's scanning feature to use in place of carrying credit cards around.  Apparently Motorola built in the chip required for access at a later date and, from what I have been able to read on the subject, Verizon is waiting for Isis although there are also rumors that it will be allowing Google Wallet soon--it would be nice if Verizon clarified its position on its website--as of now, it appears that any access via this technology will have to wait until next year.  That one issue aside, this smartphone is amazingly fast (4G LTE on Verizon far superior to 4G on Sprint) and has connectivity features that were not available on any other smartphone I've owned (including T-Mobile).  Love it, love it, love it.  Also purchased Lapdock 100 (had to return to Motorola for quick fix of screen problem on that)--recommend it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0071G0KR4" id="B0071G0KR4-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-03:</strong> I have had my Droid Razr Maxx for just over a month and I'm so glad I have it.  I just returned from 24 days in Italy and the trip would have been a complete disaster if not for this device. Since this phone is not SIM locked, I was able to buy an Italian SIM card when I arrived in Italy, so I didn't have to pay Verizon's roaming charges.One can read about the features and capabilities of the phone itself, so I won't go into detail on that.  But the battery life... WOW! I ran apps and used various features of phone all day long, every day: GPS with directions and mapping service, internet browser, camera, Quick Word, Map My Ride (I was biking through Italy), email, music player, and movies.  After a day of biking, with the Map My Ride app running for about 12 hours, using internet and email, taking pictures, listening to music, and watching a 2 hour movie I had stored on the phone, I only used 50% of the battery.  A couple of co-workers convinced me that this was the main reason to buy this phone over any other - the battery life - and they were so right.Things I found out about foreign travel with a smartphone:To get the SIM card, I had to go to the cellular provider's store and have my passport with me (I had left my passport with the hotel's front desk, so I had to go back and get it)It took about 2 hours after buying the SIM for it to be activeI bought time as I needed it, but the places to buy more time are often closed in the evening (like after 8pm)Using 3G cost about 4 Euros a day, not including data usageWi-Fi isn't always free and/or not always available in ItalyYou can only stream Netflix in the 50 US states (sometimes you just want a little bit of home to comfort you after a rough day of travel)Calling the US cost about 60 cents per minuteIf I ran out of time on the card, I could still receive calls from home (free for me, not free for the caller)I had considered taking my Wi-Fi tablet with me to Italy, and buying a cheap Italian phone to use there, but EVERY day I was in Italy, I was so glad I had this phone.  Wi-Fi in Italy is not very reliable WHEN it's available, and the tablet would have added bulk to my already encumbered travel, plus the tablet battery only lasts 5 hours at best.  Buying and using the foreign SIM was quick and easy, and re-inserting the VZW SIM and getting back onto the home network upon returning home was seamless.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0071G0KR4" id="B0071G0KR4-review21" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-30:</strong> I had the droid razr, then I brought the maxx and now I'm back with the razr.  I actually love the phone but there are issues that really bother me.  When you are speaking on the phone though the earpiece if you are on more than 10-20 sec you can't adjust the volume of the call. With Visual Voice mail you can't adjust the volume period if the phone is on your ear.  I would also like the report that the tethering does not work properly either.  You can't get to sites like yahoo, msn mail mostly htts sites.Is the phone pretty yes, is it fast yes, does it have excellet call quality yes Does the maxx have a good battery yes.  But thats not what all to a phone.  If you buy a tv with a remote control you expect the channel button to work, well I expect the same thing here from Motorola.I tested 3-4 phones in the store and they all have the same issue which to me means motorola is selling defective phones.  I can't understand why some people spend between $300.00 and $ 649.00 and dont care about things like this.  Truth be told the Droid X which is a discontinued model and other phones since have had the same issue and the company does not seem to care.  Don't go by my statement try it for yourselves.Now That I expressed this let me tell you why I went back to the razr.  for me (not the avg person)  my hearing is very sensitive and I found for me that on the maxx I was saying what what more than the oringnal razr.  If the phone sounds good and you can live with the issues I metioned above get the maxx because the battery is worth it.one may ask why did I not go back to my old phone such as the thunderbolt Well the Razr is cool but mostly because if I'm holding the phone wrong in my ear I will drop the call because of the senor problem.When picking out a phone I guess instead of thinking you are going to get a perfect made phone you have to pick out what flaws you have to live with.

The carbon fiber is a nice touch and the front of the phone is pleasing to look it, it is also quite light despite its size.Over all I am very pleased with this phone, the build quality and form of the phone is top notch and I actually like motoblur.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0071G0KR4" id="B0071G0KR4-review23" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-01:</strong> ok now this is the best phone hands down i love love love love love this phone i am not a big moto fan but gots to show love to this one i love the hdmi part no other phone even have that now and that is a plus love the feel of it love the way it is made love the fact that i can drip it and it still come back good love the fact that is could take a 64g sd card i love the over all look of the phone</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0071G0KR4" id="B0071G0KR4-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-12:</strong> Just got one of these things to replace an AT&T; phone (Captivate) where the contract was close to expiring.*WOW*The phone charged from 30% to 90% in just over 2.25 hours (full recharge time is said to be 2.5~3.5 hours).  That's REALLY good given how massive this battery is...The battery is big, but not much bulk is not added.  And given how smartphones were a decade ago, yet for such tiny screens in return, I have no complaints on the form factor and the battery within at all.Also, every time I bought a 3rd party battery, it died within 6 months.  So the need to have a spare battery is eliminated by this device, and I don't need to trust the quality of third party replacements. So the need to worry that this battery cannot be replaced by me is a non-issue.4.3" Super AMOLED screen is really nice.  The Captivate's screen isn't as saturated, but was slightly better in presenting darker colors (or maybe the gamut was limited and it elevated darker hues, resulting in an inaccurate appearance). This is a VERY minor nitpick, as only one game (Osmos) has a dark background where minute detail is no longer as visible, but for every other game there are no issues that shroud darker elements, and every other game looks FAR BETTER under the RAZR MAXX, thanks to the color gamut and darker hues.The 960x540 resolution on the RAZR takes a moment to get used to (most models have 800x480), but it makes life easier for browsing and, again, the 4.3" screen size makes typing easier.  (the PPI to the RAZR is 256, whereas the Captivate's was 216 - neither is as densely packed as a certain phone from a fruit vendor (300DPI), but I've no complaints on screen quality.)FAST.  This phone is FAST.  No doubt other phones might be faster (e.g. those with the Exynos processor), but this one is no slouch.  Every game and app I've worked on feel more responsive, especially Osmos (which I didn't expect to run better, but it did).FEEL/SIZE:  With case protector (Otterbox) on both devices, the RAZR MAXX is almost as thick as the Captivate, but taller.  And just slightly wider.  It weighs more, but the feel of the MAXX feels more solid and well-built.Actually, I do have a gripe:It has 16GB internal flash RAM and also includes a 16GB MicroSD card.  It would have been ideal if a second MicroSD slot existed, which would really bring out the full potential of this phone.Definitely 5 stars - there's nothing that's really detractable, not even the nitpicks.  The fastest data connectivity sweetens the pot (YMMV, I chose Verizon), and reports on how it's impossible to drain this thing down in one day with moderate/heavy use are truly impressive.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B0071G0KR4', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B0071G0KR4', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B007K3RPGM</h2>    <p class="price"> $B007K3RPGM</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

The CD mount does a great job and has added features to accept a wide range of cell phones.Unlike most phone mounts, there are no grippers used to hold you phone in place. Instead, magnets and metal inserts are used. There are two inserts to choose from. One has a sticky back on it that can go between the battery and cover. The second choice goes between the phone and protective case. So, you can pick the method that best suits your needs.There is a "Ball & Socket" joint that allows the phone to be positioned in the best viewable angle, even landscape mode.The base will affix to the CD slot with a fixed edge, which can be manually adjusted with a turn screw to give the proper tightness.Most phone mounts have to stick to the windshield, which can become cumbersome or jus in the way. This is where this mount shines, it will keep you line of view cleaner.I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HUIL310" id="B00HUIL310-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-26:</strong> I don't have room between where my dash and my CD player meet to use it without blocking my buttons and clock, so I used it with another ball socket mount with suction cup that I had for my old car dock.I'm going to have to replace it soon though, because I want to buy a Qi wireless charger for my new Galaxy S5.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HUIL310" id="B00HUIL310-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-13:</strong> even with the use of the happy face plate or the rectangular plate (supplied with the mount), it still is not enough.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HUIL310" id="B00HUIL310-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-28:</strong> no, the gf didn't say that-- I did!

The phone is slow, lags, and exhibits the following wonderful traits:1.  WiFi instability issue NEVER fixed since release2.  Muting the phone then restoring sound keeps all volume at 0.  You must manually increase the volume.3.  Text input by Swype will often spell the word but not insert it4.  Loses 4G signal then switches back and cannot send mobile data5.  Slow and laggy.  Gets worse with each update6.  Camera takes smeared, blotchy photos in anything but bright light7.  Screen almost impossible to see in bright daylight8.  Samsung Bloatware sucks up all RAM.  You won't have more than 500 MB of RAM free at any one time9.  Piss poor design means that a muted phone will still BLAST that AT&T; ringtone when the phone spontaneously restarts10.  Music decoding will insert skips into some songs (especially jazz songs)11.  NFC never works well the first time or the second or the third12.  Screen attracts and holds all grease until wiped with pure alcohol13.  Without power saver and auto screen bright, you will get about half a day out of this if you are playing music and doing light browsing.Samsung doesn't give a damn about their customers, they just want a sucker to pay a lot for their beta test phones.

The N9005 or a carrier model is the only way to go.This international version is not for US users or even US users who travel. If you are not a traveler forget the comments about it being region locked.I still say 99.9% of all people who get the Note 3 could not care less if the international version is region locked.  However, this model, if you expect to use it in other countries has resulted in a thousand problems, literally. The phone is neutral but when it is activated the SIMM locks in the region and you cannot use it elsewhere.  Do not think "unlocked" means you have magical usage.  There is NO universal phone (except for spies), although some phones use other country SIMM cards -- but not this one!  I get a US carrier phone, travel internationally, and keep my phone in airplane mode and use WIFI or get a phone card.Get the scoop.  Do a search for XDA-Developers dot com, and go to the site. This is where the big boys and girls hang, for programming, not dumb questions.Type in Galaxy Note 3 in the field for the phone you desire.In the Forums, go to galaxy note 3 general.Search down the page to the thread "SIMM restrictions on unlocked European Note 3."  This thread has over 1300 posts.  Yes this is a big problem.Read the first half dozen pages and the last 10 pages, but also check especially posts 1041 through 1045, and pages 117 and 18.This N9000 phone is the international or European version. It was released 2-3 weeks prior to the US versions, it is NOT LTE it is 3G; it has a different CPU -the Samsung Exynos 5 processor, not the Qualcom Snapdragon 800. US residents should not get it.  We need to get a phone activated for our respective carriers, which changes the last digit of the number. Search Amazon for the Note 3 for your carrier.  Notice the different last digit.Amazon may be confusing people by not listing the phone for what it really is and they need to change that in the title of the phone.  The black version does say 'International" in the title and so should the white one.Now, down to business.First, I am not affiliated with Samsung in any way, nor do I work for a cell phone store.  I am a writer though.Secondly, I hate long reviews where the poster just reports the specs you already have.  Rather, these comments show why the Galaxy Note 3 is more technologically advanced, and more phone for your money, compared to the many good phones on the market today, and the not so good phones, like the cave phone (that's what I call it) that does nothing.1.

Despite a few good contenders, no phone on the market can match the combination of vibrant color, and deep blacks.  Check it out for yourself.  For those who prefer drab, you can even adjust color intensity and contrast.Is this practical?  You bet.  You get more viewable data for all social networking apps;  you can see more email and contacts without scrolling; browsing is quick and pages more visible; YouTubes and video are fantastic; games are more playable; you can see larger areas on GPS maps;  you get a better view of radar in weather; (live) wallpapers look great; you can use it as a reader; you can multitask with it; and with the right productivity apps you can even get some work done on it.  I will never go back to a small screen phone.2.  The CPU in the US versions is the quad core Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 @ 2.3, which is the fastest processor on the planet as of this time.  It will perform well for years to come.  A few other phones have it.  The international version uses the Samsung Exynos 5 processor. It also has another quad core processors making it octa core, but it is still not quite as fast as the Snapdragon.3.  The Adreno 330 GPU is the best on the market, a few other phones have it.  It is 50% faster than the Adreno 320 in the Galaxy S4 which is a screamer.4.  It's the only phone to come with 3 GB of DDR 3 RAM.  It also comes standard with 32 gigs of storage  and you can add more with an SD card.  Note: No extra charges for these!5.  It has a great 13 megapixel camera with useful software, a BSI Sensor, Smart Digital Stabilization and high CRI LED.  Very few phones have this.  It is also the only phone to  do 4K video right now - sharp!6.  No other phone has USB 3.0.  2 advantages: the phone charges very quickly on the 2 amp charger and nice thick cable.  File transfer times are faster.  With USB 3.0, a 2 gig file takes 27 seconds from the Note 3 to my (high end) PC.  With USB 2.0 the same file takes 57 seconds.7.  How many phones have an S Pen?  Except for email and quick notes, I seldom used the S Pen on my original Galaxy Note, but the Note 3 comes with some useful software making it more functional,  and the handwriting recognition is scary accurate.8.  How many phones have a huge 3200 mA battery?  It easily lasts all day with moderate to heavy use despite the large screen.  Hardware and software improvements make the 100 mA bump over the Note 2 even more significant.  You can also open the back and change out the battery - unlike some phones.9.  It does infrared remote control.  It also has TV-out (via MHL  A/V link),  Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometer, temperature, humidity, and gesture sensor.  I'm serious people, you get more for your money.10.  Hello multitasking!  The fast CPU & GPU, extra memory, and high-resolution 5.7 inch screen make multitasking feasible and fun on a cell phone.  You can even scroll through multiple applications in each split screen.  This is even better if you hook up a keyboard and mouse via Bluetooth or USB, and connect through HDMI to your TV or computer monitor.  The Note 3 can actually serve as a small computer.  How many phones can do that?  You can also mirror the phone screen with your smart TV for internet, games, viewing pics, whatever.11.  This the best cell phone for gaming on the market , period.  The above features and OpenGL 3.0 which is part of Android 4.3 make it happen.  Don't believe me?  Read the reviews, watch the you tubes, and compared it for yourself.12.  It doesn't just have GPS, it also uses A GPS (improved), and Glonass Satellites.  DL a GPS satellite app, and you'll see it will access between 5 and 25 satellites at once depending on time of day and location.13.  Got Knox?  No, you don't.  This phone provides business enterprise, and government level security for boot, VPN, etc., and comes in handy for privacy on public Wi-Fi.  You don't have to use it, but it is there.14.  The air command and air gesture features make the phone futuristic.  How many phones do that?15.  Is the screen too large for one handed operation?  Yes, but so what?  The tradeoff is worth it.  Besides, Samsung now includes software to shrink it for one-handed so you get the best of both worlds.There are 2 things that Samsung needs to improve in my opinion.  I don't know how many thousands of people need to tell them that putting the volume rockers directly opposite the power button is inconvenient  for users.  The Note 2 placement was better but still wrong.  (I do like the new speaker placement though.  Its perfect for horizontal viewing because your hand channels the sound to the user).This phone should also be waterproof right out-of-the-box.  Not a scaled-down version, just waterproof the thing.  Other manufacturers are doing it for their flagship phones.  That means Samsung can do it too.  Truth be known, we users never want to see another flagship phone that is not waterproof.  It's doable, so please do it.  Smoke it with that nano-whatever  waterproofing stuff.  You went to CES.  (Oh, and S voice is still sorry, use Google voice)All that said, I'm very, very, happy with the Note 3.  IMHO the Note 3 is so powerful and functional, it is the first device I would classify as a hand held computer.  As a professor, I researched it for days and used the original Galaxy Note for over a year now.  There are other good phones, but the Note 3 does it in one package, and in almost all cases does it better,  for the same flag-ship- phone price.  I feel sorry for the fanboys and people believing advertising  hype who don't research the market.  They pay top dollar but don't get their money's worth.  Amazon is a great place to get your money's worth and to find out user information.  Thanks Amazon.Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention, it's a really good phone too.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F33OE06" id="B00F33OE06-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-09:</strong> Been a Note 2 user for a long time.  When the Note 3 was announced, there were rumors that the phones were programmed for specific regions.  Meaning, SIM cards for that region worked on the units built for that region.  I thought that was a dumb move from Samsung if they did that.I got my unit from Amazon and have it shipped here in Manila, Philippines.  Stuck my local Telco sim card and it works.  Migration from the Note 2 to the Note 3 was a breeze.  It was done in a matter of less than an hour.  Only issue was migrating from the old S Note to the new S Note.  Other than that, am happy with this unit.  Power consumption seems to be better than the Note 2.  But I got the Zerolemon battery and case as I know the stock batteries won't last a day without a recharge.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F33OE06" id="B00F33OE06-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-10:</strong> WHAT A JOKE!!!

My friend and I picked up the Note 3 from TMobile here in America yesterday! It was very limited at certain stores. Now to the review.This phone has the highest and if not, tied for the highest spec for a smartphone out. 3GB of RAM, the closest phone has 2GB. The processor is tied with the Snapdragon 800 being used in a few high end Androids. The camera is amazing. Very clear and a lot of different options to chose from camera or recording. The screen resolution is amazing for a big phone. When I whip this bad boy out, it automatically catch peoples attention. You don't have to squint or zoom in. Things are that clear and big.Those are the pros. There are some cons, if you can call it that. My biggest complaint is - THERE ARE SOO MANY FEATURES & FUNCTIONS! I love this phone, don't get me wrong but I haven't had time to fully go through everything this phone has to offer. You can run 2 apps at the same time like Youtube and surf the internet. Name another phone or tablet that can do that? Take notes on a fly and have it sync with everything. This phone does it all but like I said, there's a lot to know about the phone which is a good and bad.The Note 3 is here to stay. The specs are up there so you won't need a replacement for a few years if you so choose. The battery life is ridiculous long. I left the house this morning with it full at 7:30 AM, have listened to music on my train ride back and forth, surfed the web and text my friends on and off. It is now 2:00 PM and my battery is like at 93%. I don't see how anyone can manage to drain this battery in 1 day if it wasn't intentional cause even with moderate use, that battery is lasting all day.I bought this device October 2, 2013 and if anyone has any question, please let me know and I'll gtt back to you as soon as possible</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F33OE06" id="B00F33OE06-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-24:</strong> WOW.

Of course, you can use your own phone's proprietary charging wire.+ CHARGES OFF ANY STANDARD USB CHARGER - you can use either then provided wire or your own.The bads:- The built-in charging Micro-USB wire is a little short - about one inch because you don't want to stretch it too much - and it's not easy to pull out. This charger is meant to be used by responsible adults.- Too shiny - both the front and back come in a super-shiny finish, making it a fingerprint collector.- The manual's English is atrocious - this is a Made in China product. The product's quality is excellent but the maker should hire a native English-speaker/writer to fix the manual.Overall, I am quite pleased with the product. The functionality is there, the in-body charging wire is an innovation that makes the product stand out, the small/light body is 'right' and the few 'bads' that I noted may or may not matter to any particular user.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CCWP93W" id="B00CCWP93W-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-07:</strong> Ultra Slim 3200mAh External Battery Pack looks very slick, it is quite thin. One unique feature of this external power pack is that it has a micro USB cable built into the side of the unit (see attached photo collage). It pops out of the side on a coiled cable, so if your mobile device takes a micro USB connector you don't need to carry any extra cables. This built-in cable delivers very rapid charging (see test results below). The power pack also has a port which allows you to connect other connectors, so it works with devices that have proprietary connectors as well.I tested Ultra Slim 3200mAh External Battery Pack with Galaxy Nexus Phone (running ICS 4.0.4), Samsung Galaxy 7.7 Tablet (running ICS 4.0.4) and iPad Mini.I received this power bank from the manufacture for an honest review be it positive or negative. Top reviewers are often asked to review new battery packs and one of the benefits of being asked to test different power banks is that it gives me an opportunity to compare them to each other using the same charging test, so I can compare them using "apples to apples" comparison. This set of tests allows me to provide unbiased results as the numbers speak for the performance of each unit.I received two identical units black and white, having two of them allows me to test for consistency in manufacturing. Ideally I want to see the same performance numbers for both units, and this was the case with the two Ultra Slim power packs .My methodology is to charge each mobile device on each port of the unit for 10 minutes and measuring how much each unit was charge in that 10 minute period. In addition I tested charging two mobile devices at the same time. Each line in the table below represents a separate 10 minute test. I use Battery App by Elvison to determine how each device recognized the charging source. 'AC' status means the charging is at full charging rate. 'USB' status indicates charging at a lower charging rate. 'Discharging' status means that the charging rate is below the power that the device is consuming so it slows down the discharge rate but does not re-charge.&#10152; General features:======================Ultra Slim 3200mAh external battery weighs 3.2 oz. Its size is 2.25" x4.25 " x 0.375". The pack has one USB output port and one built-in micro USB cable.In addition to the built-in micro USB cable Ultra Slim comes with a charging cable and two tips - micro USB and iPad. It did not have tips for Samsung Galaxy Tab or lightening connector for iPad Mini and I used my own charging cables during the tests. I am attaching a photo of the Ultra Slim 3200mAh during one of the test next to my tablet for size reference. You can find this photo by following 'customer photos' link under the main photo in this listing.Ultra Slim 3200mAh looks very slick: it is thin, has a nice finish, and in general has a look and shape of a smart phone. It shows the charge level by displaying 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% on panel. When it is charging, however, this indicator gets turned off. But the charging continued even when the lights were off. This is a little different from how other external power pack indicators work (they stay on when you are charging),so I wanted to mention it. In addition to the charging capabilities, Ultra Slim has a built-in flashlight.&#10152; Test Results:======================&#10004; Galaxy Nexus Phone~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~White unit: AC ~~~~~ 6% change in charge in 10 minutes (built-in mciro USB charging cable)Black unit: AC ~~~~~ 6% change in charge in 10 minutes (built-in mciro USB charging cable)White unit: AC ~~~~~ 2% change in charge in 10 minutes (separate charging cable)Black unit: AC ~~~~~ 2% change in charge in 10 minutes (separate charging cable)&#10004; Samsung Galaxy 7.7 tablet~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~White unit: AC ~~~~~ 1% change in charge in 10 minutes (separate charging cable)Black unit: AC ~~~~~ 1% change in charge in 10 minutes (separate charging cable)&#10004; iPad Mini tablet~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~White unit: AC ~~~~~ 1% change in charge in 10 minutes (separate charging cable)Black unit: AC ~~~~~ 1% change in charge in 10 minutes (separate charging cable)&#10152; Key finding:======================&#10004; This power pack has great performance with built-in micro USB cable.&#10004; Using your own charging cables the power pack works with both Galaxy 7.7 Tablet and iPad Mini but performance is on the slow side.&#10004; I observed the same performance for both the black and white model, which is good and reflects consistency in the manufacturing process.I highly recommend this power pack to people who can take advantage of the built-in micro USB cable.Note: the photo collage referenced in the review can be located by following 'customer photos' link under the main photo.Ali Julia review</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CCWP93W" id="B00CCWP93W-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-10:</strong> The iFlash Ultra Slim Portable Power Bank Ultra has a great look and design that can add 1 full charge or add 10 hours of talk time to your iPhone 4S / 4G / 3GS, 100+ hours audio playback, or 100% - 200% to the battery life of most mobile phones.

I also have (and have reviewed) the white version. Rather than repeat the review, I'll summarize the main points: this is a nicely made, very slim (about 3/8 inch thick) powerbank that works well. What it lacks in terms of charge capacity it makes up for in ease of carrying around.Like the white version, the only major issue I have with this is the micro USB cable that is built into the device. While this is a good idea since it makes the power bank easier to use, the cord length is too short for comfortable use (about 4 inches long fully extended) and it can be a pain to recoil the cord so that it fully retracts into the power bank body. That's the main reason for a loss of one star.However, the black version also has another strike: it is a major fingerprint magnet. While I'm sure the white version attracts as many fingerprints since it also has a glossy finish, you have the benefit of not seeing them. That's not the case with the black version - smudges galore!I won't detract a star because of that since it's strictly an aesthetic issue and has nothing to do with performance, but point it out in case you're bugged by easily smudged devices.Like the white version this does most things very well, and does so with a very small footprint that's easy to take along. Definitely worth considering, and a good value for the price.[sample provided for review]</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CCWP93W" id="B00CCWP93W-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-02:</strong> This external battery is so slender and so sleek that it looks like a small iPhone. I can stick the battery in my purse with its charging cable to have it available wherever I go. Most other external batteries are more bulky; therefore, I take them with me only when I'm traveling. This iFlash power bank simply slips in one of the inner phone pockets in my handbag. Even better, I like that I can get more than one iPhone 5 charge out of it even though the specs say only one full charge.It takes about two hours for the battery to charge my iPhone 5 (lightning cable/adapter not included), about 30 minutes longer than if I plugged it into an outlet -- not bad at all. I like the push button display of how much charge is remaining (in 25% increments.) There's also a pull-out micro USB cable built into the side for charging devices with that kind of connection; for this reason, the battery is ideal for smartphones that use micro-USB. It comes in two colors, this black one and a white version.

For one thing it is quite slim, compact, and easy to tuck away in a desk drawer, purse, or briefcase.  I like the power banks that are usually dubbed "lipsticks," but this one is much less clunkier than any of those are.  The most interesting, and perhaps welcome thing about the iFlash, is the fact that it has an internal spring output plug.  At first I thought it was a switch, but was very pleased to note otherwise.  It comes out quite easily when you simply pinch and pull.I instantaneously knew how much power was in the battery when I pressed the button on the top face where the iFlash logo is.  Instead of simple dots or slashes accompanied by numbers, the LED lights are underneath.  The numerical panel lights up nicely with a bright blue.  If you hold the button for a couple of seconds, the mini LED flashlight comes on (reverse the process to turn it off).  I gave this small battery pack a little workout right out of the box.  I tried it out with an iPad, which it certainly isn't meant for, but was getting a surprising  2% to 3% charge every fifteen minutes.  Mind you, this little experiment was undertaken with a battery pack with probably no more than a 74% charge to begin with.This is definitely a high-quality battery pack that is set up for gift giving.  It's in a hard shell, plastic case rather than a box and is very attractive.  The box can either be recycled, use to store the battery pack or used for something else.  I'd never heard of iFlash before testing some of their battery packs, but have definitely been pleased with not only the performance, but also attention to detail.  For example, the cords are of high quality and the plugs fit quite snuggly.  iFlash stands behind their product and is offering a 1-year limited warranty.WHAT'S IN THE BOX:~  3200mAh power bank~  USB cable~  30-pin connector~  5-pin micro USB connectorSPECS:~ Weight: 92g (.20 pound)~ Capacity:  3200mAh~ Input: DCV/1A~ Output: DC5V/0.6A~ Output charging time:  2 - 3 hours~ Input charging time: 4 - 5  hours~ Recycling time: Unknown (probably around 500 times)~ One year limited warranty~  ROHS and CE certifiedDIMENSIONS:~  107(L)x57(W)x10(T) mm 4.17 x 2.24 x 0.4 inchesPOWER INDICATORS:(These are numerical from 25 to 100)~ Not lit up:  &lt;25%~ One LED light on: 25% - 49% (25)~ Two LED lights on: 50% - 74% (50)~ Three LED lights on: 75% - 99% (75)~  Four LED lights on: 100% (100)OPERATING PARAMETERS:~  Working Temperature:  -20 - 45 C (-4 - 113 F)~  Storage Temperature:  -20 - 60 C (-4 - 140 F)~  Working Humidity:  20% - 80%~  Storage Humidity:  20% - 90%Sample provided for review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CCWP93W" id="B00CCWP93W-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-10:</strong> This is my review of the iFlash Ultra Slim 3200 mAh power bank. It came with a micro USB adapter and an apple adapter for Apple devices before the lightning connector. Now power banks are usually pretty big and bulky to compensate for the battery charge that they are holding, this one is unique. This power bank offers a 3200 mAh back up which is enough to charge phones with small batteries (not smart phones) quite a couple of times and a smart phone maybe about 1 time and then another half charge. This power bank conserves battery life unlike other external batteries though, the battery indicator on most power banks light up when charging a device and that lets you know how much percentage of a charge the power bank still has, this is great but those lights that are always on can reduce the overall performance by using up some of the stored energy.When you connect a device to this power bank it immediately commences to charge, but the lights remain off! This helps improve the battery life of the iFlash power bank, a neat feature that makes this one such a good power bank. This power bank also incorporates a built in micro USB cable on the right side of the product, it is a couple inches long so it isn't that long, but just having the option of using it makes it that much better if your device charges via a micro USB cable. This addition makes it not only more usable, but more portable because you don't need to carry around the cable for that such device.The best feature of the iFlash 3200 mAh powerbank, at least to me, would have to be its design, it is an amazing design and it looks amazing. It is ultra slim, it is about a third of the thickness of my phone and unlike other power banks this one is so slim and small that you can even fit it in a pocket if you really wanted to.The only con to this powerbank is that its output is at 0.6 Amps, not necessarily a bad thing it just means that the rate of charge isn't going to be as fast as if you connected it to a charger with a 1 Amp output or 2.1 Amps. I would say that although this power bank is capable of charging tablets and pretty much any device that charges via a USB port it would be more suitable for phones in general that don't have big batteries such as the Samsung Galaxy devices since those would be better off charging at a faster rate.Overall I can highly recommend this product, you will be sure to enjoy it and you won't regret purchasing one.I rate this product a perfect 5 stars out of 5 stars!I was provided this product for testing and evaluation and my review of this product is completely honest and unbiased, the words stated above are my own.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CCWP93W" id="B00CCWP93W-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-15:</strong> I've seen external battery chargers for mobile devices that had capacities as high as 12,000mAh, with up to three charging ports. For many cellphone and tablet users, that's overkill, and those chargers are fairly heavy and bulky, as well as expensive. At 4.17"x2.24"x0.4" (slightly smaller than an iPhone 4) and weighing barely three ounces, the iFlash Ultra Slim 3200 is small enough to carry in a pocket, and the smoothly curved edges won't poke a hole in your pocket. The micro-USB and iOS/Apple plugs included in the package will work with almost every mobile device sold in this country. One of each of the two plugs is included, but perhaps the best feature is a built-in micro-USB plug with a coiled cable (about 4" long) that you can never misplace. Note that no AC wall charger is included in the kit.I tested the charger with my two mobile devices, a Samsung Android cellphone (1800mAh battery) and an Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7" (4400mAh battery). Even allowing for electrical losses, the iFlash Ultra Slim 3200 should fully recharge any smartphone at least once, and extend the runtime of tablets by a few hours. Note that the output of the iFlash unit is 0.6 Amps, so charging will likely be slower compared to larger-capacity backup batteries.For users who don't require a heavy duty charger, the iFlash Ultra Slim 3200 backup battery looks like a very good choice.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CCWP93W" id="B00CCWP93W-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-10:</strong> TheiFlash Ultra Slim 3200mAh Power Bankis thin, small and can fit in the palm of your hand.  This portable power bank is perfect for use with Smart Phones, including Apple and Android Devices.  Ideal for devices using Micro-B, a coil cable is built into the power bank and pops out whenever you need it.Other included accessories in the package:+ One (1) 6" white USB cable for use with the included tips+ One (1) Micro-B tip, and One (1) 30-pin Apple tip+ One (1) black soft carrying pouch.  This pouch has a divider inside to help keep your power bank and cables separate.Even if your device does not use Micro-B or Apple 30-pin, you can still use your own charging USB cable with the iFlash via the USB output port.  This unit also features a LED mini flashlight that is activated by pressing and holding the power button, it is turned off by pressing and holding again.  The unit features percentage indicators illuminated by small blue LED lights which fade after a few moments, conserving power. This is great for knowing the current available supply in the power bank.At 3200mAh, this is designed with Smart Phones in mind, and can fully charge most smart phones, with additional power left for another partial, if not full, charge.  This power bank can also add hours of life to most tablets, but is not designed for that use, due to the lower capacity.Overall, theiFlash Ultra Slim 3200mAh Power Bankis the take-anywhere spare battery you have always needed.  Available inblackorwhite, the iFlash Ultra Slim is a fine value for such a portable multi-feature power bank.Disclosure: I received a sample product from the manufacturer for the purposes of providing this review.

You charge the power bank and take it with you to charge your mobile devices when their battery power runs low. This is especially handy for the times you're on the go & don't have access to a power source to charge your mobile device.The iFlash 3200mAh power bank won't provide a wealth of power for your devices, but what it lacks in power it makes up for in portability. Its slim, lightweight design also includes a built-in micro spring charging cable and a built-in LED flashlight! If your device requires a micro USB connection to charge, you won't need to carry anything extra with you, only this slim, light power bank - no extra cables or connector tips, just put this power bank in your bag & go! However, because the Output port is .6A, it will take longer to charge your device than power banks that feature a 1A or larger output port.It arrived with an almost full charge so it was ready to use right out of the box. You don't have to turn on the power bank to begin charging your device; just plug it in & the charging begins. The 3200mAh power bank charged my iPod Touch 4G, Kindle Fire HD & my LG Cosmos prepaid phone. I used the included USB cable & Apple 30 pin tip to charge my iPod. I used the built-in, internal micro spring charging cable to charge my phone & Kindle Fire HD. It seems that only one device can be charged at a time.Press & hold the power button to turn the flashlight on/off.To charge the power bank, plug the included charging cable & micro USB connector tip into a USB AC adapter or into your PC.What's in the box:1 Micro USB white Connector/tip1 Apple 30 Pin white Connector/tip1 27.5" white USB cable1 3200mAh power bank with built-in micro USB internal spring charging cable1 instruction manualApproximate measurements:Measures: 4 1/4" x 2 1/4" x 3/8"Weight: 3.2 ozGreat product! My purse already weighs too much; this ultra-slim power bank weighs a little over 3 oz; I don't even feel the extra weight in my purse. I love the built-in flashlight too!The iFlash 3200 also comes in whiteiFlash Ultra Slim 3200mAh Portable Power Bank - White]1 Year WarrantyA sample was provided for an unbiased, honest review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CCWP93W" id="B00CCWP93W-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-15:</strong> The iFlash 3200 mAh charger is easily one of the best looking and stylish battery charger I have seen.  The exterior is pristine white with silver trimmings on the side.  It is perfect for those who wants to have extra juice but doesn't want to travel with heavy clunky power banks.  It is less than a centimeter in thickness and just 92 gms.The remaining charge can be seen clearly on the front in blue LED - 25, 50, 75 and 100 which corresponds to how much juice is left in percentage.  The power button is at the front and unlike some other chargers is a lot easier to find.  If your phone charges via microUSB, you don't even have to carry a charging cable with you; the iFlash has a very convenient retractable.  An added bonus is an LED flashlight.  You can turn it on by pressing and holding the power button for about 1.5 seconds; it turns off the same way.The iFlash 3200 can be a great gift.  It is a beautiful product and packaged nicely in hard clear shell.  It comes with a USB cable and an extra 30-pin tip for older IOS devices.Sample item provided by the distributor for evaluation review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00CCWP93W', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00CCWP93W', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B005G21PGA</h2>    <p class="price"> $B005G21PGA</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

But I was expecting something a lot better than this.I've ordered literally a couple dozen phone cases from amazon that are all dirt cheap. And you really do take your chances when you order a phone case for 87 cents plus 1.13 shipping hahaha! You know what I'm talking about haha. But most of them have turned out alright. I like changing my cases every couple days and the only way I can afford to is by ordering cheap ones online.This is the worst one I've ever ordered, and it would cost me more in return shipping than I would get back. So in the trash it goes.It's literally a piece of paper superglued onto plastic. You can see the glue marks. The sides of the case that clasp onto the side of the phone are a bunch of holes punched into the plastic unevenly. They don't match up with the designs around the back of the phone case. When I was taking this off of my phone, I noticed I was oddly in roaming, because this case was blocking my signal.I really liked this case online. I love the design. I gave it a chance. However, please learn from my mistake and don't buy this hunk of junk. Order something else. It will be better than this crap.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G21PGA" id="B005G21PGA-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-15:</strong> I LOVE THIS CASE SO MUCH.

Even after working at it for a while, two bubbles remain. They're not that large, so it isn't disrupting the experience, but it is a little disappointing.Now to the positive: I love the texture of this screen protector. It has a matte finish that gives the iPhone's screen a tactile feel that enhances the experience of using the phone. As far as the anti-glare feature, it works perfectly.Great product dragged down a bit by our difficulties putting it on.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009A51Y1U" id="B009A51Y1U-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-16:</strong> I have used numerous screen protectors over the years some were good, others not so. This 3M was a pleasant surprise. Only one protector is in the package and it is a screen protector, reduces glare and is scratch resistant. This product is a high quality protector, with careful packaging. Videos are available online to view the application process. I have done a number of these so I did not bother with checking them. I always read the directions first. The product has two flaps with color photos and instructions which help greatly. The one protector is neatly packaged and had a longer covering that makes removing the protector much easier. Many have a protector covering that is the same size of the protector that makes it hard to see which is which. This is a great help. There is a nice, large 3M cloth used to clean your phone screen and the protector after it is applied. This is another feature that 3M offers extra. The size of most protector cloths (if included) are short and small and hard to use. This nice large size makes it easy to use. One unusual thing 3M has done regards the applicator (used to smooth the bubbles out). Most protector packages give you a plastic one, generally short. 3M includes a stiff cardboard applicator that is part of the package (open carefully!) with a blue stripe to differentiate it. Believe it or not, this still cardboard actually works better than the plastic cards for smoothing bubbles. I was able to clean my screen and apply the protector on the first try. The cutouts for the front buttons are one larger button that makes it easier to place the top section. I had a previous one on my old 4 that separated the buttons with a thin strip in between that made it much harder to place. The cardboard applicator removed all the bubbles on my 5, something I have rarely seen before. This protector does have excellent touch capacity although it does have to be cleaned, fingerprints will show on it. It feels smooth and gives a more "protective" covering than just the usual screen shield. All in all this is an excellent choice. I do recommend this product. You are able to see the screen in bright light without glare and I love the scratch resistance.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009A51Y1U" id="B009A51Y1U-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-13:</strong> I haven't been using a screen protector, although I have tried some samples of them I got. I ended up taking them all off because I didn't like the way they looked or felt. This one is different.Pros:* easy to apply (use credit card to smooth it out)* cleaning cloth included, a nice touch* does remove all glare from any angle* feels satin smooth, excellent tactile feel* fits perfectly* reduced fingerprints on screen* three in the package* thicker than other screen protectors, less flimsyCons:* anti-glare texture very slightly reduces sharpness of screen.I don't personally feel the slight reduction in sharpness is a big enough problem to stop using this. I like how it repells dirt, dust and fingerprints, and is thick enough to be sturdy and protective. I think 3Mhas a winner with this one.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009A51Y1U" id="B009A51Y1U-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-26:</strong> All screens that have a privacy feature or glare feature certainly do take away from the original clarity of you retina display.  So there is certainly a small compromise if you need to protect your eyes. Especially if you spend long hours looking at your phone, this will certainly help with the glare but don't expect the same look of clarity you'd get without it on it. It does make a scratchy sound when  gliding across the screen.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009A51Y1U" id="B009A51Y1U-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-24:</strong> The newer iPhone screens don't really scratch easy but screen protectors just give an additional layer of protection that gives some impact resistance to the glass so the screen won't shatter easily if you drop your phone.By now most have figured out how to install screen protectors.Spritz a little alcohol or glass cleaner on the surface, polish away with a soft cloth till every speck of dirt is gone, inspect under bring light to make sure, then very carefully line up the protector, peel away the bottom and align again. The start at bottom going to top slowly, every so slowly laying down the protector on the glass screen while sliding a credit card on the just laid down protector so you keep eliminating any air pockets. Slow and steady is a job well done. Then peel away the top to reveal the perfect shiny new screen with no air bubbles and protector barely visible except at the edges.However, the thinner and cheaper no-name protectors are no good and no matter how well you lay them down they bubble up or get a weird orange peel effect due to cheap adhesive layer. The 3M protector eliminates that as well as some of the glare so you can see your phone screen in brighter light. The tactile feeling is pretty good, and I'd rather take a tiny bit of loss in the tactile feeling to keep it scratch and shatter free. It also keeps off messy fingerprints. Every now and then I just spritz a tiny bit of water on it and wipe it down with a soft cloth to keep it grime free.As long as you take the time to apply it as carefully as they do in electronics store or at the mall kiosks you should get great results with this protector. Or you could bring it to one of those mall kiosks and have them apply it for you for a few bucks.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009A51Y1U" id="B009A51Y1U-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-19:</strong> As far as screen protectors go, this one is fine.  It is priced decently, fits the iPhone 5 screen perfectly, goes on easily, leaves no bubbles, and reduces glare as advertised.  For those reasons I give the product five stars out of five.However, here's a word of advice for those buyers who may not have used an "anti-glare" screen protector before: You should be warned that anti-glare screen protectors inherently reduce the quality of the screen due to a matte finish, which produces a somewhat "filtered" effect.  If you want something truly clear, that won't inhibit the beauty of the retina display, you may want to try3M's "clear" screen protectorinstead.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009A51Y1U" id="B009A51Y1U-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-27:</strong> Either this is a great screen cover, or I'm FINALLY figuring out how to install these things!  This is the first screen protector I have ever installed on my iPhone 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (yes, I've had all 5 major releases) that didn't involve a frustrating process of applying, removing, realigning, etc.  It just worked.  I may have just gotten lucky, but it seems like the material was a bit stiffer, making it easier to manipulate.  Another trick is to apply the cover in a humid environment (like the bathroom with the shower running) to cut down on floating lint particles.The anti glare finish does cut down on the clarity of the screen a bit, but it does really help in bright sunlight.  I also have an anti-glare screen on my Macbook, so I have grown to prefer the matte finish that doesn't attract fingerprints as readily as a gloss finish.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009A51Y1U" id="B009A51Y1U-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-31:</strong> Highly recommend these screen protectors, especially if you use your iPhone out doors a lot.

They seem to help a little, but they also add a very slight distortion to the screen. I'm not entirely sure if anyone's come up with a solution that doesn't do this even a tiny bit, though, so maybe it's just one of the drawbacks of this type of technology.Mostly, this seems like a good product for what it is. I'm a little bugged by the idea of 1 per package on a product where it's so easy to mess up installation. If you have a lot of experience with this type of thing, that may not make a difference since you probably have a pretty deft touch with getting it on just right. If you're new to screen protectors, though, it's tough to recommend something that'll only give you one shot.I didn't really count that against it too much in the star rating, because I figure you only end up getting to USE one protector anyway generally, so you always have the option of getting help from someone who's mastered the skill. Just take the issue into account when you're making your choice.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009A51Y1U" id="B009A51Y1U-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-18:</strong> This applied easily and didn't seem to leave a lot of bubbles.

The other downside is the noise one's finger swipes make on the screen drives me nuts. It's not overly loud- but for someone swiping in a silent room, it's very audible to nearby friends and family. The sound is a bit like what your finger on a pair of jeans sounds like- or paper. It just makes a swishy sound.It isn't any easier or harder to apply than any other screen protectors I have had so there are no pro's and con's there. It also fits well under my case/cover. I have had it on for a month now- I take several conference calls a day, run my family all over town on the weekends, and check emails and voice mails constantly. Throughout all of this it still looks like the day I put it on. If you are looking for a protector that cuts glare- this does the job without disturbing the image too much. If the noise issue is an issue for you, look for something else.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009A51Y1U" id="B009A51Y1U-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-30:</strong> This anti-glare screen protector is better than the one that came with the iPhone 5, at least the one we were provided with.  The iPhone 5 is especially bright, so it actually could use an even stronger anti-glare protector than this one, but this one is fairly decent and the best we've found thus far.  It goes on fairly smoothly and for the inevitable few bubbles that appear, there is a little tab like thing that comes with it to help push those bubbles out.

Here is the important warning: when they say don't touch the adhesive strip, they're serious.  She accidentally touched just a very little part of the edge, and that part does not stick.  Luckily it's not enough to cause any kind of issue, but we can tell that if you touch a bit more than she did, or if you touch a more important part of the adhesive, it could cause issues.  It barely shows.Otherwise, very easy installation.  Mine went on without a hitch.  The applicator and tab are useful for getting the screen on and getting it centered and leveled.The touch screen works 100% (which is an issue that other brands have had).  It also works well with phone cases, I can't imagine a phone case that would cause problems since this screen protector is so flat.The anti-glare is amazing.  It works perfectly and without any problems.

A good way to do this is the opposite motion of what one would do if it were peeled off at one corner.  It can be applied in the reverse of this, starting with one corner and letting it adhere slowly.  If done correctly, the applicator may be unnecessary.This provides excellent protection to the screen and cuts out glare - as expected.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009A51Y1U" id="B009A51Y1U-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-19:</strong> I have an iPhone 5 that I use for work and my work is 90% outdoors.

Application is super easy just like all the other screen protectors. At first there are little bubbles that I was not able to get out right after installation. The next day they were gone so no need to worry. The only drawback is it adds a bit of grainy look. All the anti-glare screens I have tried, even on my laptop give you that grainy look.

It works very well. I also like the texture of the material. I slide my finger across my iPhone very frequently. The surface of the screen protector is a big improvement over bare glass. The reason is that my finger tends to "catch" and drag on the smooth glass. It is a suction effect. With the screen protector in place, pure sliding pleasure!The screen protector is thick and stiff. This should enhance durability and perhaps even offer a bit of impact protection.The matte texture is mostly great, but it definitely degrades image quality. I would describe the effect as "a field of tiny points of light."I got lots of air bubbles. After re-applying, I got most of the bubbles to vanish, except for some edge bubbles. Those are not going away without dynamite, sadly.The cutout around the iPhone speaker is needlessly asymetrical and, um, "blobby." It looks stupid, and it made it more difficult for me to get the screen protector on straight. I simply can't understand why 3M cut out the extra "blob" of material.Lastly, there is the issue of price. Relative to other screen protectors, the price is fair. But let's be honest. It's ridiculous to pay this much money for a little slip of plastic.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009A51Y1U" id="B009A51Y1U-review21" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-24:</strong> With more than one iPhone in the house, I ordered this screen saver for the anti-glare.

Screen protectors are actually a very thin plastic sheet which adhere to the screen. They protect the screen from light scratches if you, say, put the phone in your pocket with keys or loose change. They protect it from oil should you answer the phone after putting lotion or oil on your hands. In the process, though, they sometimes trap dust between the screen and the plastic, causing air bubbles to interfere with the appearance of the image on the screen. And sometimes they interfere with the overall image quality.In this case, 3M provides a screen cleaning microfiber cloth to use initially as well as a small piece of cardboard to be used as an applicator. Used properly, you can get the sheet on the phone without air bubbles. For this screen to be anti-glare, there's a flat coating on the sheet that degrades image quality slightly. It's not a big deal, but it's noticeable, so it becomes a glare vs image quality question. If you primarily use your phone in sunlight or under overhead lighting at work, this is a perfect solution. But if glare never bothers you, get the non-glare screen protector instead.As you apply the sheet, do so in as dust-free an area as possible. The last thing you want is for static to attract dust to the protector as you apply it. Once dust has adhered to the plastic sheet, there's no getting it off.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009A51Y1U" id="B009A51Y1U-review26" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-04:</strong> This 3M Natural View Anti-Glare Screen Protector for iPhone 5 works great.

While I think these are quite good, I won't rave about thwem either (generally saving that for things which really make me happy).  That said,these do not make me unhappy, as some others have.  At this point I have purchased a dozen or more screen protectors for the various devices in our house and find that the 3m screen protectors are the best of the bunch.  They go on easily, do not leave a nasty residue (like sonme I have tried) and are comparatively thick and durable. They are better than most at deterring fingerprints and also cut glarwe (an issue here in the tropics).Time was my biggest issue with screen protectoras was the cost (given that it is a little bit of plastic film,) but having used several generic screen preotectors as well as a few brand name,  have to say that some are better than others.  Among the various brands which I have tried, I find 3m to be about the best. They may not have you turbning cartwheels,but likely won't leave you frurated and angry either, and will do a pretty good job of keepibng your screen in good shape.Now I want to find a set of these for my camwera, since the LCD screen can be hard to see in the sun (and the screen protector which I am currently using doesn't do as good a job as these of cutting glare.

Installation is pretty typical for screen protectors -- if you are really lucky, you'll get it lined up correctly.  They provide a "cardboard" piece to try to remove the bubbles but that piece is pretty worthless.  Your standard plastic loyalty card from the grocery store is more effective.The biggest problem is that this does cause the display to be "crystallized" -- so the beautiful crisp display that Apple has spent so much time and technology developing and for which you have probably plunked down HUGE bucks has just been reduced to something with the clarity of a blackberry from the 1990s.If you use your phone to watch videos or anything that is higher def than email, then you will be disappointed with this protector.

However, my poor old iPhone 4 was scratched into premature age by occasionally sharing a pocket with a key. So this time, I'm being more careful. However, given the choice, I still prefer glossy versus anti-glare protectors  as anti-glare has the problem of making everything a bit pebbly in its appearance and having a noticeable finger texture.Installation went quickly and without incident. There's a large cut out for the front facing camera, the earpiece speaker and the proximity sensor, so there is some leeway in putting the sheet down not quite perfectly.

Wipe the screen dry with the supplied cloth.3. Peel half of screen off, align the home button hole and press to the end.4. Press the air bubles out with the edge of a credit card.If you miss it the first time, you can peel it off and reapply. I had a couple tries before I got it right and it works well.

The second was horrible--it was the kind that makes the screen impossible to read from the sides to protect privacy (I nearly went blind with how grainy it made things look). This screen protector has the best overall score:Clarity: 3 starsThere is a bit of fuzziness added to the screen, sort of like a haze, that takes away from the retina display. It is not so bad that reading text is impaired, so it's not a logistical problem so much as an aesthetic one.Texture: 5 starsSome slick screen protectors almost feel sticky and can sort of catch on your fingers as you slide them across the screen. This one has a feel similar to the kindle display--almost papery, very smooth--no catching or sticking.Glare: 5 starsIt really does reduce glare! Great if you plan on using your phone outdoors.Application Process: 4 starsThis screen protector is a little thicker than the cheap ones, which makes it easier to install. The cleansing cloth helps get rid of some static, but for some reason, there's always a bit of a charge to the phone and to the SP. Some dust always manages to get in. Also, most kits come with a plastic or hard cardboard thing to push bubbles out. It's not a big deal--I just used a credit card, but I thought it would come with that. It went fine, though.

Fortunately these tiny bubbles are not visible unless the phone background is black (typically only when it is turned off).However, I don't like the way the anti-glare protector makes the screen slightly fuzzy, especially noticeable with white.  Similar to computer screens, there is a tradeoff between the clearness / sharpness of the screen and it's susceptibility to glare - any film / coating / treatment meant to reduce glare is also going to reduce the sharpness of the display a bit.  Since I've had no issues with glare on my iPhone 5 up to now, this screen doesn't really fix anything for me and reduces the quality of the iPhone 5 Retina display.I also want to agree with other reviewers that 3M should have included at least two protectors in the package, if for no other reason than it is so easy to mess up the application and having a second protectors as a backup would be nice.  It seems liek the price charged for the single protector provided is *very* high.Now if glare is a real problem with your iPhone, this may work out for you.  But if you're looking just for protection without an anti-glare treatment, perhaps the3M Natural View NV827748 Screen Protector for iPhone 5 - Clearmay be a better choice.Edit - since I first wrote this I tried out the3M Natural View NV827748 Screen Protector for iPhone 5.  I was never able to test that one out, as I could not apply it without multiple bubbles under the surface of the film.

I was traveling frequently which led to frequent drops, key scratches, etc.  Initially I was concerned on the cost of this ONE screen protector (there is just ONE in this case, not the usual 3 pack despite the large font numerical 3 on the package.) The package also comes with a microfiber cleaning cloth (folded, so it's about twice the size) as well as a stiff applicator to help install the screen protector.Using the cheap screen protectors, they usually last about the lifetime of the device, so in reality most people will be just fine with the single pack.

It's good for glare and goes on without too much fussing.The good parts:- the plastic is just the right amount of stiffness to apply easily and not give me a nightmare of bubbles to deal with. The really limp screens by other companies have bubbles galore, and are hard to line up on the iphone screens. This one is relatively easy to apply.- the screen is easy to take off when needed and put back on, due to the relative thickness.- the screen stays mostly free of fingerprints, unlike with some other protectors.- a little 3M wiping cloth and a paperboard smoothing applicator is included.- significantly cuts out glare in bright sunlight. This is the point of the product, so full marks on that.- the touch screen on the phone works very well with the protector applied- the plastic protects the glass on my phone.Less good:- the matte surface really cuts down the pristine screen resolution of the iPhone. If you know this going in, that's fine. This screen is great if you spend a lot of time outdoors, or are sensitive to glare.- only one side of the screen came with a protective layer of plastic, so my screen protector actually arrived "pre-scratched". Not a plus.RECOMMENDATIONIf you are outside a lot, this Is a good 3M screen protector that allows you to actually use your phone in comfort. You can also take the screen off indoors and save it for later use (keep the little bag handy).

Nor have I ever liked them on my tablets, whether Windows based Tablet PC's or other things like my iPads or Kindles.  They generally serve no purpose for me, since I don't have a habit of getting scratches on devices.  Fingerprints are easy to wipe off with a microfiber cloth, and more often than not even if there are no bubbles under the film when you apply it, it seems there ends up being some at some point anyway.  So for a couple decades now, going back to even just the first old PDA's, I've avoided them.I saw this one in the Vine program and decided to give it a try more for the anti-glare properties than anything else.  I figured worst case scenario I'd pull it off.When I installed it, I had the typical frustration of some bubbles, no matter how carefully I was applying it and using a straight edge to help keep it on there.  So far, just like any other protector.  But with some judicious wrangling, I was able to get it on with only a couple bubbles out to the edges of the screen, none in the middle.  And even just using a fingernail, I was able to push them out.  And unlike most other protectors, they didn't reappear.The material is a bit thicker and stiffer than most I've used, and has a slightly rough feel to it, very different from the feel of the smooth glass.  On my Macbook Pro computer, I LOVE the glass trackpad, and even though I use palm protectors on them, I never put a protector on the trackpad, as the feel and smoothness of it is one of the things that first drew me away from PC's.  But despite that, I find I now prefer this feel on my iPhone for some reason.  It just feels better to me.  I don't use gestures on the iPhone like I do on the laptop, so the slightly rougher surface isn't a hinderance at all.The anti glare works pretty well, but it's not a total solution for glare since in some situations you just end up with a duller flat white spot rather than a glaring reflection, but that's pretty much when you position yourself using it as a mirror to an extremely bright light source, which isn't something people generally do when they're using these anyway.  So for the most part, it does help improve visibility of the device, without any notable detraction in lower light situations.  It also preserves a great wide angle viewability although you can notice some dimming at extreme angles.I use it with a case and it didn't cause any issues with getting the case on or off.  The cut is about as perfect as I've ever seen, it fits exactly as it needs to, with the cutout for the home button and one for the top by the microphone and camera (and a cut to one side, for the ambient light sensor I assume).The only downside I've seen is bits of dust or pocket lint likes to gather around the edge of the protector by the home button, nothing that a brush of a finger or blowing at it won't dislodge.All in all I'm pretty impressed with it, compared to my history with this kind of product.  I'm actually keeping it on the phone, something I hadn't really anticipated I'd end up doing.Edit December 2013 - after 6 months or so this started getting pretty awful looking around the edges.  And it's not even the edges where you'd think maybe something caught it and started to separate, but around the ear piece speaker as well.  Just dust and such that got under there and gummed up the exterior edge about a quarter inch from all the edges.  Oddly enough the bottom half of the unit was totally unaffected by this, just the top half and around the cutout for the ear speaker.  I ended up pulling it off and have my phone going commando again as far as screen protectors go.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009A51Y1U" id="B009A51Y1U-review44" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-24:</strong> I have always been a proponent of a screen protector film.

I've never cracked any of my phone's screens and these days the glass is incredibly scratch resistant. First off, this thing is quite thick. You will notice it on your phone if you manage to successfully get it on your phone. It's great at reducing glare but I felt like it reduced clarity as well. The screen's "pop" went away once the protector was on. And once it was on it was very "meh". I prefer my iPhone clean and smooth so I took it off. I bought theSPIGEN SGP iPhone 5 Screen Protector Clear Steinheil Ultra Crystal [2-Pack] film cover shield for AT&T;, Verizon, Sprint, International - CLEARat launch and actually did like that one. It was super thin and the cut was perfect. You could barely tell it was on and it also reduced glare and added durability against impact. The SPIGEN also comes with 2 protectors while 3M only gives you one. So if you fudge up on the first try (which you very likely will) then your guaranteed dust bubbles and non perfect placement, which drives me crazy.

That being said it is still an adjustment.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009A51Y1U" id="B009A51Y1U-review50" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-15:</strong> This is high quality anti-glare screen protector which is also very affordable and user friendly in terms of application.

It's not especially prone to getting bubbles or lint during application but the bubbles don't seem to dissipate thereafter as they do with some screen protectors.A cleaning cloth and an applicator card (that interestingly enough doubles as the package's hanger tab) are included.

It's the first thing I did when I got them.  With that being said, the picture quality was not noticeable or an issue for me.  Application was fairly easy ... although tedious in ensuring that no dust or bubbles got between the screen protector and screen.  I am happy with this screen protector.

This is not as bad as others I have tried, but it is still present, and I don't think there is any way to get around it. You will be giving up a little bit of image quality. If you don't mind that, then you'll love this. I'm not so happy about it, as I love the image quality I normally have, and so does my wife (I actually put it on hers). I got lucky on this one and got one very tiny bubble on the corner....I count that as a success. The protector fits well, covers well, and protects the screen from light scratches, especially from keys that might be floating around in her bag. If she had kept it on, I don't know how long it would have lasted, after one week, it was pretty scuffed (but in all fairness, she has a lot in her bag)....She said it almost feels like there is a filter over the screen. I understand what she means, it is subtle, but you can tell a difference without it. Still, as far as anti-glare goes, this is probably the best I have seen, so if glare is an issue for you, this is the one to get. If not, I would pass and get a protector that is truly clear. This is also relatively inexpensive compared to some other screen protectors.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009A51Y1U" id="B009A51Y1U-review59" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-21:</strong> This was the easiest applying screen protector I have ever tried. Ihave cleaned my iPhone screen and positioned the film, then stuckthe top using the included `applicator'. No matter how good andhow fast I was, it always ended up getting bubbles and tiny dust piecesunderneath with the cheap ones. Often corners don't stick and causedust buildup then the whole thing comes off. This one is not that cheap,however. Once it's applied, it seems just staying on the screen forever orbecoming a part of the screen. The quality is very good, not too thickor not too thin and almost scratch resistant. I like an anti-glare screenbetter than clear ones due to the light reflections. Matte screen couldlook fuzzy a bit though. Lastly, I wish they put more about the 'limitedtime warranty' on the packaging.

I started with the standard one, and really didn't care for it much. Then, I moved on to this one, and I actually very much like it.First, I guess I should say that I generally don't care for screen protectors at all, as 1. they rarely go on without getting tiny pieces of lint/dust under them, no matter how careful you are, and 2. they don't feel right. Some of them make the phone's screen seem to stop responding correctly, or they feel filmy or streaky. The standard 3M one felt a little streaky and seemed to have something on it that rubbed off after just a few hours of usage. Not horrible, but I didn't like it near enough to keep it on my phone.So then I moved on to this anti-glare one, and I like it much better. As they mention in the description, it has a silky, kind of satin feel to it. When you look at it, it almost looks cloudy, though it doesn't look that way when you turn the phone on. It doesn't negatively affect the screen at all. And, despite my expectations, it actually feels very nice to use. They call it a "smooth touch", and it does feel smooth. It doesn't affect the screen's performance at all that I can notice, and it actually does cut down on glare. I've never noticed any particular glare on this (or any other) iPhone in the first place, but I must say that I notice a bit LESS of it with this protector on (if that makes sense). That is, once I got this on my phone, I noticed that I can turn it any direction and I don't see a glare with it...hadn't realized that I had made those tiny, subconscious adjustments previously, until I had this screen protector on and didn't have to make them.Your mileage may vary, but this screen protector actually has a chance of staying on my phone for a while...the first screen protector I've ever said that about.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009A51Y1U" id="B009A51Y1U-review65" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-25:</strong> I understand that this is the anti-glare product.

I worked at the Apple Retail Store for nearly 5 years and I have probably put these types of films on at least 100 phones over the years... and I'd say these are really good films and do the job if properly applied. Let me share some tips to make this a great fit for your phone. It is crucial that dogs, cats, or any pet that bears fur or feathers be in another room and that children are not running around during the installation of the film. If you have any fans (oscillating, ceiling, etc.), make sure they are off and have stopped turning completely. Turn off the heat and/or air conditioning. Seriously - it's just for a few minutes - you need to have ZERO air movement. The air we breath is FULL of tiny, barely perceptible amounts of dust and lint hanging in near suspension in the air. As long as you stop the circulation of air, these particles begin to settle a bit. The little fibers and debris you can barely see in the air are magnified 50x the minute they get under the film. Once all air movement has settled down, it's time to prepare the phone. It should be removed from the case and cleaned thoroughly by applying an appropriate electronics cleaning fluid like iClean to a microfiber cloth. Never spray fluid onto your phone! Apply the fluid on the cloth and vigorously wipe and clean it, and examine under a bright light to make sure there are no fibers there. When you are ready to apply the film, be sure no part of your finger even grazes the edge of it - or your finger grease will be there - just enough to make the film peel back after time. Use the non-sticky backing of the film to help you line up the edges.  Apply at one edge and very slowly peel it down toward the glass to avoid air bubbles. If a bubble is visible, pull back a bit and try again. Patience is key. Also - limit your breathing to slow, measured breaths - you can exhale debris right onto the sticky surface or onto your iPhone glass. Even though the films are cut precisely for an iPhone 5, you cannot just try aligning it using the corner. During the whole process, you should be watching the hole for the home button and the ear speaker to make sure everything is lining up and that it is not askew. Once applied properly, the film is secure. Your finger won't slide quite as smoothly as it does across bare glass, but it won't leave discernable fingerprints unless you were just eating fried chicken. It takes away the glare and the annoyance of greasy finger prints occluding the view of the icons, your photos, etc. Nice product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009A51Y1U" id="B009A51Y1U-review69" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-26:</strong> Overall, this is a quality product.  It is cut to fit the iPhone 5, is sturdy, and enables you to still use the touch screen as if there is no cover on it. The anti-glare feature also works well, though glare wasn't something that was a particular problem for me.  Most importantly, this product will protect your screen.It did take me several tries to get the protector on the phone without bubbles and even after multiple attempts, there are a few small bubbles that I can't seem to remove. I wish I had read the other reviews prior to installing this screen protector as several reviews offer helpful tips - be sure the phone is extra clean.

If you hold it up and look through it, the images are completely diffused.

With a normal resolution screen, the added fuzziness wouldn't be very noticeable.  With a Reina display, it is.  Personally, I find the sacrifice in crispness to be unacceptable.  Does it work?

Through an AC adapter, its throughput is ridiculously low: less than 400 mA. Through a USB port, just above 400mA. Bear in mind here that most AC adapters with USB cords plugged in will push 1,400-1,600 mA (1.4 to 1.6 amps) through to the phone. This is enough to trickle charge a phone which isn't being used, but if you're actually making calls, using data etc., the phone will use more power than is being received and will actually die while on the charger.Syncing works though I doubt these are USB 2 capable. Like I said, emergency trickle charge while phone isn't in use would be the best use for this, so stocking stuffers, throwing this in a shaving kit or glove compartment might work, but don't depend on it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CTM5L0Q" id="B00CTM5L0Q-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-21:</strong> I ordered these for multiple reasons, I like the price, the length, ect.

(this as far as i know is a technical limitation of charging from something that has power passthru. ) it may play havoc with my multi hour ingress jaunts, but i should just turn off the screen every now and then. also, it should keep the phone from getting too hot while charging, (see above), so thats a good.----update 1: if you want to get maximum life and use from the batteries , do not keep the pack on when you know the phone is sitting idle. it is my observation that keeping the battery pack on all of the time causes the phone to think its connected to permanent power source, and seems to keep the phone in a higher power state. this shows for all other battery packs, and is the design of all phones that i know.the charge lights stay blinking when when you know the phone and pack are fully charged, theory is because the pack has to maintain the charge of itself, and the phone (passthru) so it indicates there is still a charge going into them. hopefully (and apparently ) it reduces down to a trickle charge. also, as the pack is in use, the lights continue to blink, the LED's in the pack are only using mA's of power, but its not entirely necessary to be always on (unlike many external battery packs that turn off their lights after a few sec.----update 2 (2014-04-22): im only a few min. into the second purchase of this battery pack (1 month later),they have made the battery act more like other external packs,  the lights do not stay on while in use, also, it seems to show you about how much is in the battery while the battery pack itself is charging. some minor updates to this battery, now if we could get an even larger battery that will fill the gap next to the camera id keep buying one each month. still waiting for battery only option since you can get the coloured cases separate</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IMOCZOA" id="B00IMOCZOA-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-04:</strong> Received the order today, very satisfied and works perfect, exactly as described, may still early to say perfect but the fact it's superb, little bulky but this what you expect when carry a case included super power battery in it :)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IMOCZOA" id="B00IMOCZOA-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-28:</strong> I got this because the amount of time I would spend on my phone really took a toll on a batteries charge.

The rubber/silicone cover is semi hard and not really flexible. This make the cover feel cheap. Buttons are hard to interact with through the cover. The built in screen protector interferes with the way the screen reacts to your touch. I took mine off, it is held in place by a double sided tape.

I don't get that option on Amazon, and I'm an optimist. You're welcome, Zerolemon.SUMMARYIf you're looking for overkill protection AND a way to mitigate the Nexus 5's most significant short-coming (battery life), this is a great way to get it done for a reasonable price. Granted, I'd like to see instructions (not just better instructions, but ACTUAL instructions) regarding proper battery operation. I almost sent this back because I thought I had a bad battery because I didn't know what I was doing, and be prepared to sort out the proper protocol for your specific battery. This irritates me because I'm tech savvy and it took me a while to figure it out. It would be impossible for someone unfamiliar with these things, and that's bad for business.See you later 1 star: customer service starts from the moment the end user opens the product, and shame for leaving some of them puzzled. I imagine a lot of returns have happened because people can't figure out how to operate the battery, leading them to believe it's defective.Understand that this will make your Nexus 5 about three times it's girth, but I don't mind. It actually makes the phone more stable and comfortable to use, especially when moving through crowds and in the car. The little grippy texture on the sides is a major bonus. Yeah: this is a huge case, but guess what: if you're concerned about skinny jeans compatibility, buy a purse. Seriously. Skinny jeans are girl pants.Overall, I recommend this product to anyone.THE GOOD:Better build quality than my last Otterbox's hard plastic shell, though I would like to see a little more squish to the TPU outer-cover. The built-in screen cover is as good as Otterbox, or at least no worse. The fit and finish around the buttons is excellent; they're actually easier to use than a naked case.The battery gives me a solid 1.5 charges before it geeks, and charges at a current sufficient to increase my phone's charge while using it as a mobile hotspot.Also, kudos to Zerolemon for offering pass-thru charging. This is a great feature that only charges the external battery once the main phone is 100%. At that point, it trickle charges it while charging the backup. Some have mentioned that pass-thru doesn't work when the external battery is on. Why would you ever want to do that? Dumb dumb dumb.It also looks good clipped to the strap of my jump bag. I no longer work in EMS and SAR, but old habits die hard. I use a Maxpedition Tactical attach&eacute; (which rocks) when lugging the field content capture gear for my PR firm. This thing makes an otherwise unassuming murse-strap look tough. Kind of. What can I say: I'm a boot-fit kind of guy.THE WHO CARES:I noticed that the battery is positionally sensitive to causing interference. If I lay it screen down, my phone's data speeds slow and my hotspot becomes somewhat unreliable (unless I have more than twwo bars coverage). If I lay it screen up, all those problems go away and it functions just fine. I haven't noticed any issues with phone reception during normal usage.Also, the jumper is a little difficult to get out while everything is cased up if you're pulling it out with your finger nails. Don't use your finger nails. I carry a knife at all times: another habbit from my public service days. There are ridges, and you just use a little leverage after getting the blade positioned adequately. No problem.Other people have commented that they need deeper than normal mini USB cables to charge or access anything physically. This is a load. Every single USB cable will get in the holes I need them in, and the same goes for OTG. It would interfere with an OTG dock that fits close to the phone, but I've never been satisfied with any of the ones I've used. Cable and port access is fine.THE CONFUSING:Charge time on this battery is excessive. My Nexus 5 will charge from 4% to 100% in roughly 3 hours. This has about 1.5 times the capacity, however when both batteries are geeked, it takes more than 10 hours to charge both my phone and this pack to 100%. To me, it would appear it should only take 8hrs to do the job. What gives?THE BAD:First of all, the biggest detriment to this case is the complete absence of operation instructions. Yes, there are instructions on how to install your phone and the external battery, but a caveman could figure that out with ANY case. How about the battery's usage, which is the primary reason ANYONE would buy this?I've found that I need to press down on the battery button in a specific place with specific pressure for a few seconds to get the level lights to come on. THEN I need to press and hold again (you'll figure out that you have to bottom out the button) in order to kick on the charging. Sometimes it blinks for a few moments. Sometimes it doesn't. I'm just glad it doesn't blink constantly while charging.The reason I'd like to see a little more squish and flex to the TPU is because the port covers on this case are difficult to operate at times (I'm also getting older and less dextrous- thanks keyboards).Also, in my opinion, there is WAAAAAAY too much of the face exposed when in the case. The screen protector extends all the way down the Nexus 5. I imagine this is to allow the notification light to be visible, but there are better ways to incorporate that. This is a borderline "who cares?", but it does compromise the protection, if only slightly.Another thing that compromises the overall feel of quality is the belt clip. It holds the phone fine and looks okay, it also offers great stability and protection. However, the rotation of the clip itself leaves a lot to be desired: it moves way too easily. Maybe this is to make it more comfortable when changing positions during the day, but it makes it flop around when strapped to my bag, which is my primary carry method when on the go.I may be old school, but I'm a speakerphone guy. I hate bluetooth headsets. One: I'm not landing aircraft or calling in air strikes. Two: It doesn't matter what I'm working or, or for who: nothing I have to conduct over the phone requires that kind of urgency. Three: call quality sucks over bluetooth. Regardless how much you spend, it's only a matter of time before it degrades to unusable.This case renders speakerphone inoperable by creating a constant feedback loop due to 1) how the Nexus 5 designed its speaker/mic ports, 2) Zerolemon failing to mold in a divider between the mic and speaker grills in its case. Honestly, this is a fault of LG and Google in the design of the Nexus 5, but Zerolemon is supplying the aftermarket bits for it: they need to engineer a work around.In the mean time, I have to look at my bluetooth graveyard to find an acceptable device to use when I'm at the desk or in bed. I hate bluetooth for comms, but I'm even less of a fan of holding a microwave up to my head... especially when the case makes it the size of the 1969 phone in Men in Black 3.JUST END IT ALREADY:Yes: I'd like to see slightly better tactile impressions with better TPU. Yes, the instructions don't just suck, they're absent. Yes, the battery is a little confusing and slow to charge (time will tell if it's due to defect). Yes, there are other issues.However, when weighing the positives and negatives, I can easily recommend this product as it achieves all its objectives reasonably well. The instructions are an easy fix, and with them this would be a very good to excellent product. Buy it. Abuse it. Enjoy it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IMOCZOA" id="B00IMOCZOA-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-26:</strong> The case that comes with this battery is ridiculous.First of all, it breaks several of the Nexus 5's features:- Wireless charging of the internal battery does not work.- NFC does not work.- There's an unnecessary clear plastic layer over the screen that significantly decreases the screen's sensitivity.- The headphone port is made to be recessed by 3/4 of an inch so most headphones and accessory cables can't be plugged in.- The case recesses the camera and flash so you get blurring and fogging in your pictures.It is huge, cumbersome and difficult to put the phone into and take it out of.It does not fit into any car smartphone holder.It is actually 3 cases combined.There is a case you put the phone into, which goes inside another case, which goes inside a third case that has a gigantic belt clip on it.Like all Zero Lemon batteries this one has to be fully charged and discharged five or six times before it will hold a full charge.So in summary, the case that comes with this battery reduces your shiny new Nexus 5 to an android phone from 5 years ago.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IMOCZOA" id="B00IMOCZOA-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-13:</strong> The product works but is bulky.

The holster is great. If you have the Seidio Active case, this works nice. It holds the phone tight, pivots so you can have it horizontal or vertical, and the phone won't slip out.The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the clip is plastic. It's really a good clip, and works well, but if you are someone who works in an environment where you can bump into things (like I do), running into something (like a wall or door frame) might break the clip. I'd love to find a holster where the clip hings was metal, just for durability. That says more about me and how I use it than an actual defect in the product. Under normal circumstances, it is quite durable and should last a long time.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AOCCWJG" id="B00AOCCWJG-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-19:</strong> I have bought Seidio cases and holsters for about 5 years and 3 phones now. Love their cases.  Unfortunately, every holster I've purchased from them ends up with a broken clip at the hinge. The first one occurred after I dropped it -- my fault. The second one occurred after 2 years of use (out of warranty), but the latest one occurred after just 3 months of use -- no drops, no abuse. I might start looking for a different holster option. In the meantime, I need a case for my phone so here I am ordering another one because I know I can get it in 2 days via Amazon Prime, and then I'll probably play the warranty replacement game for a couple months. It just seems like they have a bit of a design weakness on their clips, but they're still the best cases and holsters I've found.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AOCCWJG" id="B00AOCCWJG-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-13:</strong> The Sedio Active has done a great job protecting the Galaxy Note II from several fall.

This one just slid off my belt constantly.  Total fail until I got my pliers out and did minor mods.  I bend the part of the clip which would be below your belt when it is in place inward to make it closer to 90 degrees or perpendicular to the part which when in place is behind your belt.  This has made it so that it stays on my belt.  It is now usable.  Out of the box it was not.  The velcro takes some getting used to but again I wanted it for rough working weekends and this makes sure a magnet closing lid doesn't get opened on me.  This thing is not bad, not good.

There is also a small soft pad on the inside.Update: 4-9-13Be careful what you rest it on. I don't know what got on it but it ate away at the top layer or the clear coat. Some of it got scraped away so don't put it in your pocket with your keys or other objects capable od scratching it.

However once again the camera lens and flash are hindered by the 'too small&#34; opening where the camera and flash peaks out. when using the flash on you camera the light bends and causes your pictures to have a haze, so you have to take the case off before you can take a photo with the flash on, this can be quite annoying.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BYJMJ5A" id="B00BYJMJ5A-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-22:</strong> I love this case!

I came across this case on thisiswhyimbroke.com and fell in love with it.  I buy all of my cases from Amazon, so this time was no different.  The item arrived in 3 days (NY to PA) and is exactly as described.  It fits perfectly, the rubber buttons are cut out and colored accordingly, it's exactly as it appears in the picture.

It looks almost EXACTLY like the classic Game Boy I used to play back in high school down to the most remarkable detail.All holes for the headphone jack, volume buttons, speakers and charger are perfectly placed and I am MORE than a little impressed with the coverage that wraps all the way around to the border of the front screen!My only tiny complaint is that I would like the rubber to be the *slightest* bit thicker, as right now it's a pretty floppy material with a bit more extra "give" when it could possibly be a tighter fit.However, overall I am extremely happy with this cute little novelty protective rubber case. Looks like it will provide excellent protection in case of drops or falls, and with two little boys (ages 2 and 4) running around my house the odds are great! ;)Thanks so much to Hong Kong for the speedy shipping and wonderful products. I will absolutely be back to buy more!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BYJMJ5A" id="B00BYJMJ5A-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-07:</strong> This is a reeeaallly cool case! I've gotten lots of "ooh is that a gameboy?" and "thats cool" comments with it, and i've barely had it a week. I ended up with two cases because the first one took 2 months to arrive so I ordered another one.One does have the "nintendo Game boy" the other one from boho tronics doesn't; although some one did post earlier that the one they got from boho tronics did...i guess it's just luck.Like many have stated, the silicone is pretty thick so it should protect it from a fall.Pros;-Definitely looks really cool-Thick silicone that should be enough to protect from a fall although I wouldn't count on it.Cons;-I think it's just luck of the draw whether you get one that has the "nintendo game boy" logo or not. I ordered one from a seller that someone else claimed shipped the ones with logo on them, but mine did't come with the logo. :( Fortunately I had another that did.-Since it's silicone it will stretch after a fair amount of use.Overall though it is a sturdy retro case :)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BYJMJ5A" id="B00BYJMJ5A-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-26:</strong> This case was very appealing to me since I have been a fan of gameboy since it debuted, and for only a couple dollars I decided why not! First of all the shipping took place from China so don't expect to receive the case in under a week. So about the case...The case is a simple semi-thick silicone case (much like the cheap silicone cases from ebay, amazon, etc). You can clearly see the seam from the machine, but again it was only 2 dollars. The gameboy detail is actually very well made, I originally assumed that it might be a print, but actually there are raised buttons and "gameboy screen". This case fits well and all ports and openings are accessible. However, the camera cut out provides a lot of flash back, and the long sides seem to be stretched out. All in all for two dollars it's a fun case to have and show your friends, also will provide adequate protection when having a night out on the town.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BYJMJ5A" id="B00BYJMJ5A-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-13:</strong> I think I must have received the new and improved case because mine doesn't have any of the imperfections that other customers have been listing.

I think most kids these days who use this case have probably never seen the original Game Boy (just as they probably haven't ever used a cassette tape!), but I have gotten a lot of compliments from my peers who had Game Boys when they were younger. It looks good and has the appropriate holes for the camera and flash, dock connector, headphones, etc. The one I bought does NOT have the Game Boy TM written on it, but it's still recognizable as a Game Boy lookalike.Like other reviews have mentioned, this does give your photos a bit of a hazy look when you use flash, but it's nowhere near as bad as the SGP case I was using before. I don't use flash often so this isn't a problem for me. The fit is a little off -- it could be a little tighter -- and it does collect a little lint when I put it in my coat pocket, but overall I really like this case!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BYJMJ5A" id="B00BYJMJ5A-review32" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-06:</strong> Looks cool but fits poorly.

I wanted a case with protective bulky corners like the otterbox and others. But the silicone insert does not fit snugly. It fits... but not at all snugly. You can just use your finger lightly to peel it away from the screen. This will allow for dust, sand, etc. to get under the edges. My other issue is there is no "real" grip on the sides. This case, to me, is about as grippy as the LG bumper case, which I did not like (other than for looks also). I'm sending it back and putting my S-Wave case back on, til I find something better.*Edit: Wanted to add that I recently received the new Ballistic protective case for my Nexus 4... it is AWESOME! A great alternative to this case, it is not slippery on the sides. Ballistic's silicone insert is not snug either, but oddly, it works! Once you put the hard part on, your phone is fully protected and stylish, with about the same bulk added as this case. Go with the Ballistic case!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A06YQ86" id="B00A06YQ86-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-19:</strong> This is a 2 piece case.

It is an excellent product for the price. However, that being said, the quality does suffer a bit as a result. The rubber portion has some unsightly ridges sticking out, and the cutouts do look a bit tacky. The plastic shell is not as thick as a Ballistic case, but I think the protection offered is still more than adequate. I personally don't like the polka-dot design and wish the logo wasn't on the back, but that's about it when it comes to gripes. This is simply one of the most durable cases you can get for the Nexus 4 at the moment. I wouldn't hesitate to get it if you're looking for some extra protection.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A06YQ86" id="B00A06YQ86-review26" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-18:</strong> for the price its not bad.its pretty ugly though i would recommend you look at the Seido Active Case</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A06YQ86" id="B00A06YQ86-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-23:</strong> Really good feel and protects the phone well.

I was pleasantly surprised by the button locations; they feel like natural extensions of the Power and Volume Rocker. I don't find myself having a hard time locating or pressing the button locations at all, they're also safely tucked at a lower level than then harder outer plaster shell so they're protected from potential side impact.This case also lends itself to coalescence with a fitted screen protector like the Skinomi I installed last night while the gel I had didn't at all&#8211;heck I didn't even attempt installing the Skinomi skin until this case came in!The MicroUSB and MiniJack audio openings aren't fit for a particular size and that's a really good thing. I see only later MicroUSB chargers have a slimmer connector while the older ones we have around the apartment have wider ones and this case facilitates them. The same for the MiniJack audio connector. Have a pair of headphones with a slightly wider plug? I'm sure it would fit.The dot pattern in back, whether an intentional design for utility or not, has its utility; it helps provide a super snug fit for the entire device and actually helps applying without much adjustment. It was easier to put on than the Ballistic case I last had.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A06YQ86" id="B00A06YQ86-review29" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-19:</strong> I received my hard case yesterday, December 18.

Their page makes it look like they will ship out fast and I trusted it. They seem to do so with their other sales. Yet on the 10th I saw nothing, on the 11th I saw nothing. On the 12th I contacted them to try to change the shipping speed and later to cancel if they could not make my deadline and they said no to the shipping (really?) and didn't reply to the cancel email. On the 13th I see amazon send an email saying the item has shipped and I just knew they didn't bother trying to fix the problem.They shipped by package services USPS when they say first class on their site (is this the same?) and they didn't think to try solving any of the problems. Several customers ordered and needed these cases by a certain date. The easy way to avoid bad feedback is to pay attention to YOUR OWN mistakes and sort them out so the customers are happy. They didn't care to do this. The product might be good, but I won't be seeing it till next year if at all.This is the only case available that offers decent protection (from the looks of it) for the nexus 4. A lot of people are in need of this and a lot of people want the case promptly. Unfortunately for this company, a lot of people won't be getting it on time because of the error and lack of willingness to fix it. Great case if I had it.

The buttons are easy to press.The hard plastic part is actually molded two-tone plastic--it looks better in person than I thought it would from the pictures.To be completely honest, a simpler nonslip pattern on the back would be more practical for one-handed phone use, but the multiple rubberized &#34;round things&#34; feel are interesting and fun. And I like it. It's not *bad*, it's just weird. And fun. Can you tell I like it?The back is perfectly flat--just like the phone without a cover.

The belt clip fits snugly and the magnetic clasp seems to hold together pretty well.

The only way around this it to lock your phones keypad before you put it in the holder. This kind of defeats the purpose of having the case then. There are several other just as cheap cases available that do this very thing.I don't see how Amazon could have left out such a key feature in the process of making these cases.While it does have a magnet clasp on the case to hold it closed it's not positioned right to turn off the keypad at the same time. Clearly whoever designed this case knows nothing about BlackBerry products and how they work in general.such a simple thing to implement and they didn't even do that...

The most important part of such a unit might be the clip.  That's the part that clips to a belt or other anchor and simultaneously attached to the case and swivels horizontal or vertical. However, there is no magnet in the case to turn the Blackberry off - major problem.  A separate, minor issue is that the magnate in the clasp is not as strong as what I'm used to in other cases.Pros:*Clip - the part that attaches to belt and also the case and swivels, as described above.*Case itself - it's tight and secures the Curve well.*Logo - I prefer the AmazonBasics brand logo over other brand logos because Amazon is known for customer service.Cons:*No auto-shut off because no magnet in case to do that.*The magnate in the clasp is not strong.*The Blackberry Curve phone loads vertically into this holster, not horizontally. That makes it just a tiny bit more effort to unholster when answering a call.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002VPE1NY" id="B002VPE1NY-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-07-27:</strong> Great price for a genuine leather lambskin leather case.

This case holds my phone securely and pretty tightly so the magnetic flap is just kind of an afterthought. I prefer to lock the keyboard before putting in the case as I do not want it to pocket dial. I am concerned that the side pieces might put too much pressure on the side buttons (I have the iDEN version). However, those same side pieces allow the phone to stay secure while it is being used for phone or music playing as it does not interfere with the headset jack.

There are quite a few to choose from and, in the extreme, some sport designer names and prices that near 3 digits.  If you want the same upscale look and quality at a ridiculous price under $10 then I am pretty sure this is about your only choice.  And what a good choice it is.  This thing just reeks of quality and its only sin is it is a bit delicate due to being made of lambskin which can be marred in appearance due to abrasion.  Lambskin is luxurious, however, and feels so rich and supple...Lambskin is also a strong leather as it has good elasticity and tensile strength for the same size and weight vs. cowhide.  In other words cowhide as light and thin as lambskin tends to have less tensile strength and splits sooner (I am a shoe retailer and a third generation shoe repairer so I am around leather on a daily basis).  So, this Blackberry Curve holder is excellent and the clip is very versatile as it rotates in no less than 6 locked positions, it is a screaming bargain...I don't know how they do quality like this at this price???

The interior is lined with a soft, napped fabric to avoid scratches to the phone. The belt clip is sturdy, neatly attached and swivels smoothly.This case would be perfect except for one key feature that was left off - a magnetic, proximity sensor which automatically turns the back light off and locks the touch screen when holstering and back on when retrieving your phone! This is an extremely important feature to most Blackberry users as it conserves battery life and eliminates "butt dialing".

I could do my emails, read texts, and play music at the same time. I could GO ON THE WEB and stay in a phone convo at the same time. Just was amazing and the phone didn't limit what I did.The first issue I encountered was the battery. It barely lasted 8 hours, and that's with background syncing and all that stuff backlight all that turned down. You'd be lucky to get 1 hour at best if all that was on. I got the extended battery, and when it helped, it somehow made my screen go nuts. No joke, put the old one in and the device screen works and never an issue. The extended battery, it scrolls, clicks n things, and the landscape mode didn't work. Motorola tech support recommended a full reset, so I had to set up everything once more.The next issue I had was the music player integration. I can BLUETOOTH myself MP3 songs that AUTOMATICALLY are stored to the 8GB factory included SD card (finally), but they do not have any sort of identification. It says the track name- but with the track number, they are only in numeric order for example 01-&#34;Only Time&#34; The album names for everything that is Bluetoothed over is Bluetooth. It doesn't drag over the album name, and the artist simply reads unknown. I tried the USB with the same result, so i guess it's not all the bluetooth.And while the ANDROID 2.1.1 Android operating system is a joy to use, you cannot save APPS to your SD card. This leads to small lagginess, such as Angry Birds, takes literally 2 minutes to fling the next bird. As far as I was told, processor speed has nothing do with this, and as this was a premium phone, I'd think it had a good processor in it.Overall:It wows, but it could be better. Do I recommend it, yes, somewhat, if it can have it's issues fixed. I guess if you don't mind the SD issue it'd be a perfect phone, but unfortunately I decided it was something I didn't want to use and upgraded.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003DQD5CS" id="B003DQD5CS-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-28:</strong> The Good: Excellent design, lots of power, superb features from Google, amazing cameraThe Bad: App store is still young, processes running in the background kills battery life, keyboard is a bit cumbersomeGoogle as been known for revolutionizing the internet and now they are with their Android phones. The Motorola DROID (A855) is the newest and most advanced phone on the market right now, and this bad boy does an awful lot. A lot of people are going to compare this phone to the iPhone, but the DROID trumps the iPhone in features, and freedom. I will discuss, first, the tech specs and compare them to the iPhone head-to-head so you can see how powerful the DROID truly is.Techno BabbleThe DROID has a 550 MHz processor, and to be specific the Arm Cortex A8 processor that is also present in the iPhone 3GS by Samsung. The 3GS is clocked only 50 MHz higher and can be overclocked to 800 MHz. To compare that the original Xbox has a 733 MHz processor. So can the DROID be overclocked to this as well? Most likely. With a monster processor the DROID can multitask and has one of the first actual mobile OS (besides Windows Mobile 7). This also means maintaining processes running in the background to gain battery life, uninstalling apps (not just deleting them), and a lot more, but we'll get to that later. The iPhone however can not multitask due to the OS running on it, and the processor is only used in games.When it comes to graphics the DROID still hasn't been pushed to its limits. There are very few 3D games on the Android market, but as of right now the iPhone stomps the DROID in the graphics department. The DROID has a 200 MHZz PowerVR SGX 530 GPU. The iPhone has the same, but due to the slightly better CPU is can currently outperform the DROID. The iPhone has been on the market for quite some time, so there are bigger better games available. The DROID should start getting the same quality soon. They both have 256MB of RAM, so under the hood they are pretty much the same.The DROID has a slightly bigger screen sizing in at 3.7' and the iPhone at 3.5'. Does 2 millimeters matter? Yes it does. There is a good 2 millimeters on the top of the iPhone that could be screen, but for some unknown reason it's not. The DROID has a higher resolution of 854480 and 265 ppi (pixels per inch). The 3GS has a 320480 resolution with only 163 ppi so the DROID has double the resolution of the iPhone. That is great for people wanting to watch high-res movies on their device.Both devices have the same input such as the 3 axis accelerometer (tilt sensor), digital compass, Multi-touch display, proximity and ambient light sensors etc. The DROID is a bit heavier than the 3GS, but only by 1.2 oz. The DROID wipes the floor with the 3GS' camera. The DROID camera is 5MP compared to the 3GS 3MP. The DROID has dual LED flash, and geotagging and it can even run higher than 30 FPS. The 3GS has all this except the dual LED flash and this is a huge plus.When it comes to storage the DROID wins with its external memory option. You can insert up to a 32GB micro-SD card, but you're stuck with the 3GS' internal memory and have to pay a huge price for more. The DROID even comes with a 16GB micro- card when you buy the phone. So when it comes to comparing junk under the hood they both have the same hardware, but the DROID has the extra tidbits that push it over the edge.GUI: Graphical User InterfaceThe DROID has an excellent GUI and the whole marketplace is run by the community. There are programs such as PandaHome, OpenHome, GDEHome etc that allow you to change "themes" for a small price or for free. These also change icons, clock widgets etc. The DROID has a great interface that is more like a computer that gives you a desktop, then a slide up menu where all your apps are stored. You can drag and drop as you see fit. The iPhone, however, is plagued with the mundane Apple OS that only show apps in a grid format with a black background. Sure you can change your "wallpaper" but this is only when the phone comes out of sleep mode so it's rarely seen. This makes every iPhone look the same so the DROID wins in customization by a long shot. There are four touch buttons located at the bottom of the screen which are your back button, menu, home, and search. You will use these buttons a lot so Motorola and Google were smart to put these here.Apps: Who's Better?It all comes down to the apps. Who has more right? Well the iTunes marketplace has hundreds of thousands of apps that the DROID doesn't have so the iPhone wins there. However, the Android market is ever-growing, and thanks to the user run community a lot of great apps are showing up that the iPhone can't run. These include a lot of customization apps and loads more. Apps are easier to run on the DROID since there is no iTunes type program. The app store is run off the phone, downloaded from the phone as well. If you don't want an app anymore you go to your settings and uninstall it. Google also allows you to refund anything you buy within 24 hours and Apple does not support this. While iTunes may have more stuff, Android has better customer service and a better community and setup. There are really no "hardcore" games for the DROID like there is for the iPhone, but it's getting there. You do not want to get a DROID for a gaming system just yet for sure; stick with your iPod/phone.Features: Welcome to Google TownThe DROID has a lot of little things going on in it. You can do everything a touch screen phone can do, but it also has a slide out QWERTY keyboard. The buttons were a little flat and the top row is hard to get at if you have big fingers, but it works well. If you tilt the phone sideways you can type with a landscape keyboard or use Google text-to-speech. I found this feature extremely useful when typing long messages or writing reviews for apps. Since this is a Google phone you get all their awesome apps such as Google Earth (yes it's in 3D and you can see every detail), and Google maps. Switch to your "car app" and press navigation. Speak your selection (i.e. Phoenix, Arizona) and Google will give you directions for a car, bus, or walking (God forbid you walk that far!). Press get navigate and the phone will speak you the directions. It doesn't update in real-time, but it does update as you drive down each block.Google Sky is a fun app that lets you point your phone in the sky and it will show you, in real-time, where each constellation and planet is. You get plenty of excellent Google apps such as Gmail, YouTube (yeah Google owns YouTube), and Google Goggles which allows you to take pictures of products or objects and the phone will scan it and search it for you. There's even a Google search bar on the desktop with a text-to-speech button next to it. Brilliant. There are plenty of other apps such as the Amazon store, eBay, Bank of America, MLIA, FML, and even ShopSaavy. This app allows you to scan a barcode and it will tell you where you can find it cheaper online or locally. Of course you have all your social networking apps like Twitter, Facebook, and MySpace which run great.When it comes to things like ringtones, pictures, and videos, so the DROID delivers. You can store any MP3, or picture and set them as wallpapers, notifications, or just ringtones. Mount your SD card via USB and just create the folders. No having to sync with a program on the PC. Total freedom is what Google gives you and this is what I love.Problems: It's Not PerfectThere are some issues with the DROID, but not many and they are minor. The biggest one is the running processes in the background that can kill your battery even in sleep mode. You have to get the Advanced App Killer app and every so often check everything you don't want running and kill the apps. Another problem I ran into was that since most of the apps are user made they can be glitchy and screw up your phone so watch out and read reviews before downloading anything. You could say that the major issue is the app store. There is a lot of apps, but some of it is junk. There aren't any excellent games available, and the app store doesn't have any sort feature except Top Paid, Top Free, and Just In.For a $550 phone (if you pay for it without  a plan) the DROID delivers and trumps the iPhone in every direction except the apps. The DROID is a very advanced phone, and is for people who love using their phones constantly and make it a part of their every day life. With a sleek design, excellent features, sturdy hardware, and monster processing power the DROID should be the #1 phone in 2010.Update: 10/15/2011Now after I have had this phone for 18 months I don't like it as much. The phone started having issues with serious lag, slowdown, and just hardly responds anymore. The touch screen lost sensitivity after about a year, plus the hardware is ancient compared to what is out now. Due to that all the apps are now optimized for higher end phones so the Droid is left in the dust.Overall the phone just doesn't really work anymore internally. It won't come out of sleep mode some times, won't answer calls, turns off randomly, and the internet is just impossible to surf due to the now weak processor. Hardware wise it has stood the test of time with many drops, slides, fumbles, and kicks. Not a single crack or anything, but thankfully this phone is now discontinued. If you have the original Droid you are probably finding the same problems even after a factory reset. The phone was great 22 months ago, but now I just absolutely hate this thing. If I were to amend my score I would give it a 4/10 now, but of course that's unfair and should be remembered for how great it was at the time of release. Did I also mention that the appraisal price for the phone is about $20 now-a-days?</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003DQD5CS" id="B003DQD5CS-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-23:</strong> I bought this to replace my current phone because it was damaged.

It was sporadic so I lived with it but knew that something had to be done. A colleague mentioned he'd had the same problem, had bought this replacement battery kit and that it worked perfectly. So I went ahead and got it. Being cheap and of the generation that keeps electronic equipment longer than disposable kleenexes like the younger folks do I figured the old 3GS actually used as a phone....like, to talk to people? had more life in it.So anyway, the kit arrived very quickly and armed with the Youtube "how to" set out to replace the battery.I cannot stress and emphasize enough how important it is to either get Instructions though a Google Search, or watch the video clip on Youtube that explains how to do this (do a search on Apple iPhone 3GS battery replacement).It took a bit longer than I expected, but that's because the screws and parts are tiny to take the phone apart - and you have to be really careful with the connectors (little flat cables with tiny contact snaps!).Once you get to the old battery and "pry" it out of the case (the glue is pretty strong) then it's a matter of sticking the new battery in and reversing your steps and snapping/screwing (did I mention that the screws are VERY tiny?) the phone back together. It's a bit tricky to get the little camera pod to seat back into its slot and ensure that all the cables are back connected properly.The moment of truth: Hit the on button and everything worked as expected!Some have mentioned they didn't get the battery pictured. This was NOT my case and I now have a 1600 mAH which has actually allowed me to routinely go 2 days without a recharge - which NEVER happened with the OEM battery.Editorial note: I did read (I think) in Steve Job's (RIP) biography that he was so ticked off when he heard that people were actually opening up the iPhones to do this type of repair (and jailbreaking and glass replacement) that he made it even harder to do ANYTHING to repair the newer generation iPhones (4 and 4s). I don't know if it's as simple to do this on newer phones.I highly recommend this to those that don't throw away their phone every 6 months and enrich Apple or the Phone companies.I give it 4 stars because the plastic tool that comes with it is not very useful and the instructions useless.I've had it in for the last 6 months without a hitch!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0061XLXX8" id="B0061XLXX8-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-12:</strong> As soon as I received the product I decided to immediately install it.After unscrewing the screen I realized that it's impossible to lift it without a suction cup.  The kit does not come with a suction cup tool, which is essential for removing the display.I decided to drive to a local pharmacy to pickup a Kitchen Towel Hook with a suction cup.  They didn't sell one.  Most of the products they sold had a double-sided tape instead.  I drove off to a supermarket - the same picture.  I then went to a hardware store and again the same thing.  Finally, on my 5th attempt I found a kit with 2 hooks with suction cups several miles away.  Bought it for $4.95.  It took me over 1.5 hours to find a suction cup.

Weird but it still worked as long as it was plugged in, For a few bucks I thought I would replace the battery and use this kit. Overall the process was easy and followed a couple of youtube videos. The inside components of the phone were not identical in the videos so check out a few to make sure your parts match. The battery fit well and seems to be lasting about the same amount of time as the original - we will see after a few weeks. On tot he tools - the philips was too big for the internal screws so was useless, the long plastic tools used to pry everything apart broke on the tips, I didn't use the guitar pick shaped ones though. THe suction cup did not hold tight enough to pull off the screen...... in the end I improvised and worked through it.

Don't fool yourself into thinking you need to spend more money because you don't. These work great and have a nice smooth feel just like the original glass. They come with a protective film with pull tabs on both sides making them easy to apply. Leaves no bubbles if done correctly and look terrific. Several of my friends have asked me what brand I bought so they can get the same for their phones. Tip - Put a small piece of masking tape across one corner of your screen to make the protector easy to lift if you don't get it right the first time. Then when you're satisfied just pull the tape away from under the screen. Works great.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00CMRCEN0', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00CMRCEN0', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B004IAJ82E</h2>    <p class="price"> $B004IAJ82E</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

I can slip in my driver's license and two debit/credit cards. It's a little difficult to get a card out of the slot, but that just means that they are very secure and won't slip out. This case, along with a few other iPhone apps, has enabled me to replace my wallet with my iPhone. So far it's working great.Update (10/18/11): Well, I still like the case, but just like another reviewer noted, the "tab that creates the pressure to hold the cards to the back cracked, and now can no longer keep my cards from jostling around." I now have to keep 4 cards in the slot in order for them not to slip out.

The price was right and it works as advertised. Now that my wife and I have matching phones (HTC Evo's)it's so convenient to be able to plug in either or both phones while driving. The unit comes packaged with one cord so we just bring along an extra one so we can charge both phones at the same time.Usually, my wife seems to always forget to charge her phone at home so she's used it quite a bit more than I. When we're on long road trips we leave the phones plugged in so we can use them as we travel and when we get to our distination, our phones are (usually) fully charged for a day of sight-seeing.I use the GPS (Sprint service) feature on the phone, so my old Magellan GPS is now obsolete. Besides, the battery had gone out (dead) on the Magellan and it would have cost what I paid for one of the phones (with rebate), and I was just about to pay out nearly a hundred dollars to update the navigation system. Thank goodness we bought the new phones.By the way, the blue light on the plug (the part that goes into the car's cigarette lighter) is just right and bright enough to let us know the connection is working. The phones have battery-charging indicators also.Rate a 10 on a scale of 1-10.

These are a good value and have worked fine but the wire is VERY small.  Obviously it is adequate for the application but I have to wonder how long before there is a failure where the wire enters the plug.  Having said that, handled correctly by grasping the body of the plug and NOT the wire to remove it from the tablet it should hold up okay.  Time will tell.  I would buy more if needed.And these do appear to be SAMSUNG OEM equipment and not a clone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00APLOM62" id="B00APLOM62-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-02:</strong> It's a cable, what more can you say.

As a charging cable? Not so much, provided you don't have a Samsung AC USB adapter. Samsung uses something specific in it's hardware that prevents their cables from charging the tablets when used in anything but a branded AC unit, PC USB or a compatible pigtail cable. These can be purchased separately, but it's rather obnoxious to require a measure like that, especially when it's a proprietary cable.If you already have the AC unit and just need to replace a cable that a pet, child, drunk friend chewed on, then this'll work a treat for you. If however you don't have any charging accessories, keep in mind you'll likely need some additional hardware if you want to charge out of anything other than your PC.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00APLOM62" id="B00APLOM62-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-16:</strong> to get my samsung tablet 101 galaxy  up and working again this is awesome it come sooner than i thought. its great great for the price as well.As a matter of fact i ordered two, now im set for awhile.great product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00APLOM62" id="B00APLOM62-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-10:</strong> Excellent Data Cable with reinforcements at the ends..

I plugged the cable with 46% the first time and after an hour, it went up to 80%. The logo seems original to me.

I had to get a pair of needle nose plyers to pry it out.  Of course the tiny internal parts if the cable broke off.  I took the chance and was ripped off.  If Samsung didn't charge so d#@% much money for a simple cable then we could buy directly from them. Buyer beware.Is was purchased through Markers Mark.  I suggest avoiding them.
