I am on call a lot so my phone must work. This is a really nice power source. It is easy to use, has helped me out many times when my phone is dead and I need to make or receive a call, and fits in my purse or pocket nicely. It has a male plug projection so the cover must be kept on when not used, to protect it. The only minor problem is it is hard on nails to open it, but the lid must stay on to protect the plug so I accept that. It works for about 3 charges when new, but I just use it when my battery runs low and I am on call. I recommend, would buy another, and I hope this helps someone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AS9WQVE" id="B00AS9WQVE-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-19:</strong> I have a Samsung galaxy S2, so use the enclosed micro USB to USB cable in order to both charge the battery and charge my phone. While some reviewers mention a problem with the battery pack not seating properly, this is only a problem with iPhones, because the cord running from the battery to the phone works just fine.Overall, I like the small form factor, the fact that it is black, and that it came with the cord I needed. It charged my Kindle all the way, and it charges my phone to 100%. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't automatically shut off when it's finished charging, so even if I only needed a portion of the charge, the entirety of the battery pack still becomes depleted because I don't remember to go back in an hour and shut it off. That said, for the price this is an excellent little product and it certainly saved my bacon on a recent trip where I didn't have access to a charging station for 24 hours.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AS9WQVE" id="B00AS9WQVE-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-04:</strong> yes there are a lot of battery juice packs out there, but I've never seen one quite like this.  Aside from the fact that the design is fashionably sleek and compact for carrying around, the price is extremely cheap for what it has to offer; what I like about it the most is that this PowerBot TNT 2600 unit already has a built in lightning adapter which made my life a lot easier without having the need of bringing an extra cable around all the time. Furthermore, this PowerBot TNT power bank charges more than just iphone 5 or idevices, it can also be used to charge microUSB devices such as hTC or Samsung smartphones as well, which makes it very very handy for the friends and families around me who are on android phones (great gift for heavy duty mobile device users).  This juice pack does not have a led flash light however, but I am quite fine without it as I can use my phone as a flash light anytime as long as it's got power.  Overall, it's a classy little powerhouse that keeps the power thirsty mobile devices properly fed.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AS9WQVE" id="B00AS9WQVE-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-10:</strong> There wasn't supposed to be any difference in connection between the iPhone 5 and 5s, but this worked for the 5 and not the 5s.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AS9WQVE" id="B00AS9WQVE-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-05:</strong> Great idea and concept for the Iphone but didn't last very long.

Powered by Samsung Battery Cells. Limited Edition Model (originally labeled 10000mah). Includes Free Wall Charger and Bonus Bag. 5V 3A Dual USB Output. Fit for Android & Apple De...andPowerGen PGMPP8400 8400mAh External Battery Pack High Capacity Power Bank Charger Dual USB output for Apple iPhone 5 4s 4 3Gs 3G, iPod Touch, iPad mini 1 2 3 4, The New iPad 3/ HTC sensation, XE, XL, One X S V, Thunderbolt, Inspire 4G , EVO 3D, EVO 4G, ....  These are all about the size of a pack of cigarettes and fairly lightweight.  I didn't think you could improve in any other way.  What I like about the POWER BANK is that it can charge ALL my devices, like my iPhone 5, my iPod and best of all, my iPad mini.  In fact, if you check out the specifications, you'll see it can charge many different kinds of devices that the others cannot.  It's very small and very portable.  Using an included Lightening connector and standard USB port (a short 4-inches), it charges in about 2-3 hours.  It also holds it charge for many days.  The usage of the charge depends on what you use it for.  It can charge my iPad mini in less than an hour as well as my iPhone.  There is a mini port input on one end and a standard USB input on the other.The best part about this device is the price and the small size.  It will not give you the charge of the other two items I mentioned as it simply does not have the same size lithium battery, but it makes an excellent backup.(Compatible with: iPhone, iPad, Samsung Galaxy, LG, Motorola HTC, Nokia, Android, Smartphone, MP3, MP4 Video Player, GPS, Tablets, Cell Phones, iPhone5 iPod, Nano7 iPod Touch5, New iPad 4 and iPad Mini).  Product generously supplied by manufacturer for an honest review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AS9WQVE" id="B00AS9WQVE-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-11:</strong> Any charger with a lightning plug built in should have 2 things going for it:1 - it must charge lightning devices, which means 10watts so it can do the iPhone 5, iPad and iPad Mini.2 - it must be recognized by those devicesUnfortunately, while this charger seems to do job 1 most of the time (which is good), it fails utterly at 2.  No iDevice I have (iP 5, iPad Mini) will connect without the dreaded "This accessory may not be compatible..." notice.  I'm fine with that for devices not specifically built for lightning connectors, but if you have a device that - essentially - only works with iDevices, then it should be made to work with iDevices. Certification is expensive, but critical. I'd rather pay more than have a product that might not work.I should point out here that on several occasions - specifically with both WiFi and bluetooth enabled - the phone was not being charged while the device was attached.  So sometimes it even fails at job 1.Second issue: The internal parts are not well fixed in place.  If you shake the device - gently - you can hear things moving around.  I have two units, both exhibit this problem.  This is a rechargeable battery that gets put into backpacks, bags, jackets - the thing will get a little jostled from time to time just by nature of being a portable battery.  It *must* be solidly built or it will break and could cause damage to anything near it.I cannot recommend this item.  Though the concept is brilliant, and there are very few devices like this available, the execution and workmanship are far below acceptable.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AS9WQVE" id="B00AS9WQVE-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-06:</strong> Ok.. So needed an emergency charger to have with him while at work (sometimes he doesn't have access to an outlet)So, after scouting amazon I came across this item and for the price and design I couldn't resist giving it a try. Well i'm so glad I did.. This product is amazing!! First the design is sleek, it fits your pockets or purse, its not bulky and it has many functions. The white cord that it comes with it is just the right length. The power bot came 75% charged already which was a plus and just the other day hubby was charging his S3 while my brother was charging his IPhone at the same time! I was impressed!  So far we have no complaints, so please don't let the negative reviews steer you away!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AS9WQVE" id="B00AS9WQVE-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-30:</strong> You don't know how many times I've been without a phone because it died on a day trip or something.

Has on and off button so you do not loose power that is left after charging your phone, No more plugging into an outlet or looking for one while on the go as I use my phone all day.It charges your phones when you loose battery charge while on the go with no hassle , you can even talk on the phone while charging.I am extremely happy with my purchase and will buy two more for my hubby and daughter.Works for all smartphones and Iphones so no worries about what type of phone you have ,it is UNIVERSAL. I also charged my IPAD but will be using it mainly for my phones.Thank You Amazon for offering this great product at a great price.Update- I had to revise this feedback as this charger stopped charging after we used it about three times and it did not fully charge my phone , i thought it was the charger not having enough juice but I after charging the PowerBot overnight and plugging it into my phone again -there was absolutely no charging going on and item had to be returned,Too bad it worked great for the first three charges but there is definitely something wrong with this charger,had to return and now searching for another one,hope this helps you all.Thanks SM.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AS9WQVE" id="B00AS9WQVE-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-27:</strong> Does not attach to phone with a case or cover.

I typically switch phones monthly, amongst all the high end smart phones. I like to try different ones, and have had every high end Samsung phone, GS2, GS3, GS4, Note 2, etc. and also the HTC one, LG Optimus G pro, Nexus 4 etc. also, all my house TVs are Samsung smart Tv's and I often like to project my phone videos and pics onto the 55" TV in the den. (much like Samsung phones)I use a galaxy note 8.0 tablet for car and home etc.I typically switch phones b/c I don't believe there was one phone that had exactly what I want...although each had "some" good stuff to add.Now, I believe that a phone is a computer..with phone abilities. I'm not alone in this. I'm NOT the guy who says all phones nowadays work fine, and there is no need for improvement or speed increases. I run 2 companies, have a child, and have a hobby competing in dance events on weekends. I often use my camera for video, pics, and watch videos on my phone. I am not a gamer kid. I rely on my phone to be fast, effective, and the software should make it easy for me to operate a business and be dependable with the ability to jot things down quickly, send emails and share stuff often. And I should be able to communicate...AND NOT RUN OUT OF BATTERY too soon.So, here goes my take on the G2. (I'm on Tmobile)I have used the G2 for about 4 weeks now. I try out almost every feature and see if it's useful for my purposes. I consider it a better phone than the Galaxy S4, and by preference better than the HTC One. I do consider the HTC one to be an amazing phone of all my choices. Great job HTC.Screen:The screen size is huge relative to the size of the phone itself. I think all phones should be this way. I felt like we should be carrying almost all screen without the extra bulk...and the G2 finally provided that. The extra border is useless to me, and just makes for a bigger device in my pocket and hand, with unusable area. The screen is beautiful. Daylight viewing is much better than all other phones accept the HTC One. I can see this thing clearly in very bright outdoor situations, I can't say that about Samsung GS4. The screen is a pleasurable experience. 5.2 inches doesn't bother me. I'm average size. I could have been just as happy with 5" with no border. Either works. I will say that the Official quick window case makes me like the phone 10x more. The case is super thin, but adds function and protection. The china knockoff cases are too thick for me.I feel that 5" and 5.2" are acceptable screen sizes. I was happy with the HTC One (4.7") but watching videos were just too small for my taste.BRIGHT WHITES: I prefer this. And LG hits it right. I enjoy that part of apple devices actually. Clean and bright. LG has that for me.Build Quality:I give it a 10/10 for a plastic phone. Super sturdy and feels solid in the hand. No creeks and cracks like the cheap Galaxy S4. Samsung gave plastic phones a bad name. LG makes it's plastic phones with quality feel. Now, I do not care for the plastic material in terms of being a little slippery. I use the quickwindow case, but wish they would have used a Nexus material for the back cover. Not a deal breaker, but a wish. Not a huge issue for me.Speakers:Not so good. Do the job, but not the best. This is the one area they could have made better, but I assume they ran out of money and had to pick which options mean the most to consumers. Me, I always use Bluetooth (LG HBS730) and don't use the speakers much. I used the HTC one speakers, on occasion, and found they were nice, but not worth the extra " in height to the phone. My preference. I wouldn't want them the extra height.Phone quality:Phone works great. Bluetooth works great. No issues with hearing people with our without Bluetooth. Speaker calls are acceptable when needed.Quick Charging:This phone charges ridiculously fast. They don't tout this feature near enough. I can be at 15%, and plug it in for 20 minutes, and be at 40% with the LG 2A charger (or any 2 amp charger including my car charger). WOW. Now THAT IS a USEFUL feature! A 3,000mAh battery plus quick charging. Much better than HTC and Samsung I used.Battery life:Best of any phone I have used. With a full 1080p screen, and never using "battery saver" this phone has a great battery life. A full 4+ hours better than the GS4, and ridiculously longer than the HTC One. I sync 4 email accounts every 15 minutes and listen to music throughout the day.Lag:No lag. Very quick. Much like the HTC One (which I consider the HTC phone to be very nice in that area)Buttons on the back of the phone:LG placed the buttons (volume and Power) on the back of the phone. They said its more natural than the standard way with buttons on the side: My take? BRILLIANT. It's very nice to not have ANY buttons on the side of the phone, and my grip on the fold is much better holding it the way they recommend. It won't slip out of my hand AT ALL. Very good feature. I hope they keep it with all their future phones. I use the Knock on feature mostly, so I rarely use the back buttons but this was a good move IMHO. If Samsung or Apple would have done this, people would consider it brilliant. It is a good habit and functional.Knock on feature:Great feature. No need for a power button. Works great for me. One secret is when the phone is on, and in an app etc, just tap at the top area twice near the notification bar, to turn it off. (sometimes in an app a double tap activates the app stuff). This alleviates that in that situation.A worthy feature worth keeping. I find myself trying to do that with my Samsung galaxy note 8.0 tablet.LED Light:Love it, works great. Glad they included it for notifications when phone is off. I use it often.Camera:I won't go into a lot of detail here, but I think it's the best camera I have used. Optical image stabilization is a great feature, and the rest of the features are similar to Samsung in terms of modes. I'll let the camera review blogs cover this. I like it and consider it premium. Pics and video are truly amazing on this screen.USB OTG:I like the ability to plug a flash drive into the phone and have access to it to move files or watch movies or whatever. Every phone should have these drivers in their software. And most high end androids do. Apple doesn't. Cables are $3 on Amazon. Use it for business and transferring files quickly.Software:I have used phone software extensively from everyone accept Sony. HTC, Samsung and Nexus etc.Here is my take on using the software for business and pleasure. I like it. Thoroughly.Here is why.Quickmemo: works great. For both screen saves etc. I actually use it a lot. I never really used the Samsung "memo" feature. I prefer Quickmemo being in the notification bar with wifi, Bluetooth etc. I turn it on when I am on the phone and need to jot something down. It quickly saves to my notebook and I'm happy (similar to galaxy note 2,3 notebook without the pen). HTC doesn't have this option for business, and Samsung is lacking (maybe not the note 3 I don't know)VUtalk:Meh. I guess in the rare occasion I had someone with an LG phone I was chatting with, it may be useful. Can't say I use it. It's whatever.Browser:I like the browser viewing experience when on the web. I consider it nice like the HTC One...which I considered the best. Smooth transitions, quick, and not jagged or laggy. Almost up to par with Apple in smoothness. Now, I am a big fan of "whiter whites" and this is where I think the LG shines (along with the HTC One). My one problem with the Galaxy S4, was dingy whites. It bugs me...although I like Samsungs darker blacks. My eyeballs need a bright white like Apple's.Keyboard:On par with HTC One, much better than the GS4 in terms of accuracy (for me anyway). I don't need swiftkey or swype anymore and I get to keep the numbers above the keypad.Basically I like the software adds. The stuff I don't use, I turn off. i appreciate the fact that when I get a text, it shows up in its own little window over any screen I am on. Very non intruding, yet lets me answer texts right then. Works the same when you get phone calls. VERY NICE feature.I appreciate the option to add themes from the stock launcher. (see OG pro themes for freebies on XDA)I also appreciate that I can change the app draw icon size to large. Very nice feature other phones do not have.Lastly, I am amazed and saddened at how the price of this phone has dropped so soon. It's still an amazing phone and I consider the best (note 3 as well)...but without the marketing hype, people don't buy it as much. Which is silly to me.That's it for now, will update when I have time and think of other useful things.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F2SGBXK" id="B00F2SGBXK-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-17:</strong> Pros-1.

It is a fragile fingerprint magnet if you don&#8217;t use a cover.Having used the LG G2 as my primary phone for the last 2 months and a half I think it is enough time to write a fairly competent review of my experience. My experience with the device has been very pleasant. I love the phone, but as with any other electronic device it has its pros and its cons. I will explain with more detail each of the above pros and cons below.Pros (continuation)1. Probably the single most important thing a smart phone needs to have is good performance. In this aspect this phone certainly delivers. It is fast, very fast. It will handle pretty much anything that you can throw at it. I currently have 1 live wallpaper running behind three home screens that have a total of 4 widgets. It still runs flawlessly. The transitions and animations are smooth and lag free. My previous phone was a Galaxy S3 and even though that phone was no slouch you can definitely tell the difference between the S3 and G2. I have seen the biggest improvement in the browser. The G2 is noticeably faster opening tabs and loading pages. It is also smoother when zooming in and out of web pages. As far as games are concerned I have not run many graphic intensive games. I do play a lot of Temple Run (my favorite game) and it runs with no problems.2. Battery life is often times the biggest weakness that a smart phone can have. That is not the case with the G2. Battery life is simply outstanding. I find it almost impossible to drain the battery with normal use in one day. For example, having use the phone for 14 hours today listening to podcasts and music, talking for about an hour, sending over 50 text messages and watching Netflix the battery is still at 60% before going to sleep. By the way, the screen brightness was at 75%. I absolutely hated having to always have to dim the screen in the S3 to have the battery last me a whole day. The only thing that takes a considerably amount of battery is the GPS. An hour using the GPS with full brightness will use about 25% of the battery. Not a big deal if you have a car charger though. Speaking of charging, this phone charges from 0-100% in two hours. Not bad at all for such a big battery.3. One of the most advertised aspects of this phone is its big beautiful display. There is no denying it is gorgeous. Absolutely great if you want to watch videos and pictures. Reading on the phone is comfortable. Colors are considerably toned down from the AMOLED displays on Samsung phones. The pixel count in the display is through the roof making texts incredibly sharp. I have not had any problems with burn in or flickering on the screen. Nothing more to say here, the screen is awesome.4. The camera of the phone is excellent by cell phone standards. There is no way it is going to replace a DSLR camera but it can replace a regular point and shoot. I have not used my regular point and shoot camera in the last two years. The LG G2 takes excellent pictures during the day and decent pictures at night. The pictures come out looking much better at night if you use the &#8220;night&#8221; mode on the camera app. But that can be a hassle when you are trying to take a picture quickly. LG has marketed OIS capabilities of the camera. Honestly, I see this having the biggest difference when I am taking videos. The videos definitely look less shaky than the ones in my S3. When it comes to taking pictures however I don&#8217;t think it really does much though. If I am not careful I still get the occasional blurry picture.5. The phone comes with 32 GB of memory. You can only use about 24 GB out of the box. After installing all my apps, music, taking a ton of picture and videos I still have 12 GB left. The storage is not a problem in my opinion. It is a good thing the base configuration of the phone comes with 32 GB and not 16 GB.6. I got used to the buttons being on the back of the phone after a few hours. It just becomes second nature after that. I actually find the position really comfortable now. I laugh whenever somebody tries to turn on my phone and they spend half a minute trying to figure out how to turn it on. If you are hesitating on this phone because of the back buttons DON'T. They are really no big deal. You might actually like it after a while. Even if you still don't like the buttons on the back you can always use the knock knock feature. That way you don't even have to use them if you don't want to.Cons (continuation)1. The bad thing that comes with having such a big phone is that it makes it pretty difficult to use with one hand. It can get annoying when you are driving and trying to change a song quickly on the phone. I have small hands for a guy but they are not exactly tiny either. The phone itself is pretty thin and it definitely packs the biggest screen possible with the space it has. The borders are very small. Just keep in mind it is still a huge phone, not much smaller than the Samsung Galaxy Note 2. That is great for watching movies but a real pain in the behind if you like using the phone with one hand.2. Having use the G2 the last few months you can definitely tell that the LG software team is not up to par with its hardware. I have experienced a few bugs while using the phone. None of them a huge deal but annoying nonetheless. For example, the knock knock feature should be more like knock knock knock knock. You definitely have to tap more than once to get it to work at times. Also when the knock knock feature is On and I am going to put the phone in my pocket or lay it on a table the phone turns On for no apparent reason. The problem goes away if I turn the knock feature off. But by far the most annoying bug I have had has been with the messenger application. I have had to completely turn the notifications for text messages off. The phone will not turn off the screen if I have the notifications On. It happens with every single text message application on the market which makes me think it is a bug in the operating system itself and how it is handling these notifications.3. This phone has no removable battery or micro SD slot. Not that big of a deal for me but I know many people care about it. It might be a problem in a couple of years if the battery starts giving me any problems and I need to replace it. By that time I figure I have gotten a new phone though.4. I have tried the quick remote feature a few times now. It works with all my TVs and DVDs on my house. The set up was simple enough. The problem is that it just doesn&#8217;t have nearly enough range and you have to point exactly straight at the device you are trying to operate. Often times it doesn&#8217;t receive the command and you have to press it again, again, and again. Very irritating. It is definitely a feature I see using in case of emergency only if I ever lose or break the other remote controls. It is a real shame though because I can see how useful it is to have all your remotes in one.5. When you first get the phone it comes with the LG stock launcher. It is not bad but it is not nearly as good as some other launchers you see on the Play Store. The Nova Prime launcher has less clutter while having more features and customizations. There are no swipe shortcuts in the LG launcher, which is one of the reasons I like Nova Prime so much. The LG launcher is very similar to the Samsung Touchwiz in a lot of ways. When you swipe down the notification panel it has toggles for rotation, wifi, data, Bluetooth, GPS, airplane mode, quick remote, NFC and more. It also has volume and a brightness slide bar so you can adjust them. All of these features in the notification area are very useful but it would be very nice if you could have the option to take them away. You can&#8217;t take them away which makes the notification feel cramped and cluttered.6. The final problem with the phone is that just like with a lot of phones a protective case is a must. The phone is fragile and it will definitely break if you drop it. Not only that, it is also fingerprint magnet. I had my phone two days before deciding it was a mistake to have it without a cover. The phone looks disgusting without a case. You can see the fingerprints from a mile away. The phone feels slippery without a case too. I ended up purchasing the Incipio Dual Pro case. It gives the phone a much better grip and minimizes fingerprints. It also offers very good protection while keeping the phone pretty slim. I highly recommend it.In conclusion, do I recommend this phone? I sure do. Overall, the phone is a fantastic devise. It is fast, has a nice screen and it takes good pictures and videos. The battery lasts all day which is a big plus in my opinion. Unfortunately I cannot it give 5 out of 5 because of all the cons I mentioned above. The biggest problem being the software bugs it has. To be fair though I don&#8217;t think there is a single phone in the market that is worth 5 out of 5 stars. There just isn&#8217;t. There is a lot of pretty impressive competition but you will always find fault with a product if you really want to look at it with an objective view. I really hope this review helped you decide whether this phone is right for you. If you are in the market for a new phone keep an open mind and go to the store to try different phones. There are other options besides Apple and Samsung phones and the LG G2 is certainly worthy competition.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F2SGBXK" id="B00F2SGBXK-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-12:</strong> I chose this phone after deciding to switch to AT&T from Sprint. It is an excellent overall phone with an awesome, bright, clear screen that is large but simultaneously does not make the phone seem huge. I love the &#34;knock on&#34; feature which allows me to turn on the phone without touching any buttons. Additionally it has a feature that detects when you are looking at the phone so that it will not go to sleep while you are reading, etc. It is very fast and I have no complaints so far. AT&T's service is leaps and bounds better than Sprint's in my area which also makes it much easier to enjoy this great phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F2SGBXK" id="B00F2SGBXK-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-18:</strong> Very good.

Samsung, Apple, HTC and others certainly make excellent phones. I know. I've owned and used the iPhone 4s and iPhone 5, Samsung's S2, S3 and S4, and the HTC Amaze. This phone, however, the LG G2, is simply the best I've ever used. The screen is large with a gorgeous, brilliant display. The phone is very fast thanks to the Snapdragon quad-core processor. The battery is not removable, but it's a Li-Po 3000 mAh battery with the prodigious capacity to supply about 17 hours of talk time. I've been using the phone on and off all day and still have about 80% of the power left.  There is no SD card slot. The phone's design is probably too slim and tight to accommodate a card, but it comes with 32 Gigs of internal memory, about 27 of which are available to the user. I've loaded literally thousands of songs, and about 60 video clips along with over 200 hundred photos and I still have seven gigs left. If I want more storage I can always use an external stick. I paid full price for the phone and it was still almost $200 less than the 32 gig iPhone, which also has a fixed battery and no SD card slot.The software LG stuffed into the phone is well thought-out. I hated the problems inherent in the iPhone's small virtual keyboards and the various links and points that had to be poked or drawn with great care to perform simple functions. I also hated the fact that when I spoke on the phone, my ear would inadvertently trigger the address book and sometimes cut off the conversation. No such problem on the G2. The keyboards are actually large enough to use and the helpful guessing at words as you type is very clever and very useful. There are so many things that LG has done with the software, and so many things I've yet to learn, that I can't comment further except to state that there's nothing I've seen in their pamphlets or propaganda that isn't the product of a profoundly wise and practical design team.Finally, there's the sound. None of the "professional" reviews of the LG G2 I've read or seen have delved into it, but the sound through ear buds is utterly superb. The HTC One comes close, but I think the LG G2 has the edge. One or two reviewers commented on the sound of the speakers. Well, the iPhone and Samsung speakers are just as mediocre, but anyone who listens to his or her cell phone speakers for the thrill of the experience is no audiophile. I listen through ear buds when I exercise and when I walk, and what I hear on the G2 is utterly astounding. At home I coupled the G2 with a cheap blue tooth speaker and was so impressed I bought the Bose SoundLink Mini. I listened to both the HTC One, with its excellent "Beats" audio and the G2, and to be frank preferred the G2, at least for classical music. I felt as if I were standing next the Steinway as the marvelous Yuja Wang played Rachmaninoff, or as if I were in the middle of the combo during a Jazz performance. Rock or pop may sound better on the HTC One, although I'm certain the G2 could also deliver anything the aficionados of Pop or Rock would want.I like the LG G2 very much and would recommend it to anyone. To me, it's simply the best value there is in cell phones today.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00F2SGBXK', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00F2SGBXK', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B008B820SS</h2>    <p class="price"> $B008B820SS</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

Frankly, the OtterBox fits the Samsung Galaxy S III more snugly, which is a good and bad thing.  It is very difficult to take off.  The Incipio slides on and off more easily, not to say it fits loosely, but I could see a possibility that in taking it out of a snug pocket, both of the pieces, which fit together, could come off.  I always put it in a jacket pocket, which fits loosely, so I don't anticipate the problem.  Whereas the OtterBox Commuter case hugs the entire phone tightly, I can bend the top and bottom of the silicone easily away from the phone, but it snaps back when I let go.Both cases use a polycarbonate exoskeleton over a silicone inner.  Both silicone inners create a lip on the front, so if you do drop the phone on the front, the lip will protect it.  The exoskeleton on the OtterBox is a slightly more rigid and thicker, so perhaps it might be a bit more protective.  Furthermore, the OtterBox has tabs which fit over the headphone and charge ports, making it more protective against the elements.The killer to the OtterBox deal for me, though, is the button material that is used over the volume rocker.  The volume rocker on the Galaxy, itself, is soft and quite easy to use -- almost too easily touch.  The material that goes over the rocker on the OtterBox is terribly stiff.  Both the salesperson in the Verizon store as well as me had to turn the phone on its side and really push down hard on the top or bottom of the OtterBox button in order to get the volume rocker switch to respond.  Neither of us had good luck using a one-handed approach to the phone in that regard.Contrast that, not only to the Incipio, but to OtterBox's own Defender case, which has a button which is MUCH more pliable, making it far easier to manipulate the volume rocker underneath.  If I needed a really a hearty, super-protective case (If my phone were to be in physically perilous situations a lot), I'd definitely consider the Defender.  But the Defender case adds considerable bulk - both weight-wise and size-wise.  If you think you bought an elegant phone with nicely curved lines, fogeddaboutit.Which brings me back to the Incipio.  Perhaps it doesn't cross the 't's and dot the 'i's the way the Commuter case does, but it otherwise gives the normal user a substantial amount of protection -- quite adequate really.  I have already dropped the phone twice in two weeks, including once on its face on my ceramic-tiled bathroom floor.  No problem.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B820SS" id="B008B820SS-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-07:</strong> This case is just great, I'm a branch lover, and Incipio is one of them, all Incipio cases are great, this one is just fancy and elegant</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B820SS" id="B008B820SS-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-30:</strong> This is my third replacement Incipio case after the first one I had (white/black) became horribly discolored and my second one broke while removing it from the phone.This third case (silver/gray) has its own issues:The back is actually an aluminum look finish, looks cool but is chipping away unfortunately.My biggest gripe with this particular case is that it's super slick (can't really rest it anywhere like on your leg which I do quite often while in the car or resting since it will slide right off), the other two cases I had were grippy which was nice.All that being said, these cases have protected my S3 very well.On to the next one!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008B820SS" id="B008B820SS-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-14:</strong> The case looks great, is a perfect fit, and I can use the phone in the case with my car mount and sports armband.

The silicone cover that goes on first reaches all the way around the bezel of the phone, and still makes it easy to press the power and volume buttons. The hard outer shell slides right and keeps everything in place while offering more protecting from drops and scratches. Now keep in mind, that after awhile the silicone part of the case WILL stretch out over time and not offer as much protection around the bezel of the phone. As of this review, this is my second one of these style of cases. The first one I got with the release of the phone back in August 2012 and lasted me until now. That's about 6 months. Something to keep in mind for you.Update: The nice finish on the plastic part of the case has started to come off now, and I find myself picking and scratching it off.

You're buying a fake, not an original Griffin article2. There's no warranty of any sort - Amazon customer support offered me a refund, which I will exercise3. Even the cable is a low quality one, it split right before the 30-pin connector, like all low quality cables do (genuine ones split from the same place too, honestly, but they last a lot longer)They worked great up until they died last week.

They fit nearly flush into the socket which is nice as I can close the cover on my A4 and it's completely hidden.  1 amp output is sufficient for everything except for my TomTom which likes 2 amps for best results.  Now we can charge our iPods and phones in the car without concern. One other thing: the iPod cord is really beefy!I also bought a Kensington PowerBolt DuoKensington K33497US PowerBolt Duo Car Charger, iPhone 4 Compatiblefor its 2 amp outlet that I keep in the accessory port under the armrest.  It doesn't fit as well in the lighter socket as it protrudes enough to interfere with the lighter cover, so the Griffin is a better choice for that location if you're looking at both.

I have two power outlets in my car, and it simply does not make a connection in either. Which is too bad since I was pretty excited about it.If you don't believe me, read the other negative reviews, many of which make a reference Mazdas. Or better yet, search the reviews for 'Mazda' and see for yourself.The reason why I gave it one star is because the product description makes no mention of incompatibilities (and therefore implies it works with all vehicles).

I didn't want to have to keep pulling a big adaptor out each time.  I leave the USB adaptor in the lighter and I just remove the plug.  Also works great because my lighter socket is constant voltage (doesn't shut off with the key) I have left it in for over 1 week when I went on vacation and it doesn't draw enough residual voltage to drain the battery. My car started like normal when I got back.  Excellent!  I also use the other plug for the other accessories I use.

I have a 2010 328i xDrive Sedan, with the 6FL package (aka, a USB port for music) and the logic7 stereo system upgrade.  I'm an audiophile, so I decided that i wanted a high-quality digital media system in my car.  I purchased a small, 2.5 inch external hard drive, and I tried to use it in my car.  However, the USB port only provides 500mA, while the drive I had needed around 800-900.  Therefore, I needed an external power solution.Meet the Griffin PowerJolt Dual Micro.  When it says "Micro", it means "Micro".  It fits 100% flush to the cigarette lighter socket.  It has 2 usb ports, instead of the more traditional 1, so I can charge my phone and operate my music hard drive at the same time.  My drive came with a USB Y-cable, so I plug the data end into the vehicle, and the power end into the PowerJolt, and it works like a charm.Only problem is (and this is certainly not the fault of the product, but more the way my vehicle is designed) that the cigarette lighter shuts off the moment you power down the car, but the USB port does not.  Therefore, since it can't provide adequate power, the drive struggles to shut off, and it seems to cause the iDrive system to become confused, and then it locks out the USB port (probably a computer controlled safety system to prevent power drain on the battery), and it won't work until the iDrive computer does a 'cold' restart (takes about 10-15 minutes of the car being off, I haven't found out how to force a restart).In order to fix this problem, I'm looking for a small, USB battery pack that I can connect to the Griff PowerJolt, and then plug the Y-cable power into the USB battery pack.  The drives goes into a lower power power save mode after about 10 minutes, so it just has to have enough gas to get it there, and then once the car's on again, the battery pack can recharge.But anyway, it's a great product, highly recommended.  Just be aware that it only provides 1 amp per USB port, so it won't be able to charge an iPad.  However, I suppose one could get a USB Y-cable with a USB female port on one end, and then one could plug in the 30-pin apple cable, and then the iPad would be getting 2 amps--not quite the 2.1 that the wall charger provides, but close enough so that you would be able to charge it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0042B82W6" id="B0042B82W6-review50" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-08-31:</strong> I have been reticent to spend $29 on an Apple Car Charger for my iPhone 4 so I previously purchased two iPhone power cords off of eBay that are basically cheap knock offs.  The first one worked for over a year and the second worked for 6 months before it broke apart.  I realized it was time to get a quality item and was about to buy Apple brand when I saw this one from Kensington-which is a known brand for these types of things.  Here are my thoughts:-Item works great.  My last charger was VERY slow to charge my iPhone 4 and this one will charge it up in a flash.  Beautiful stuff.-Removable cord-so if I need to use the cord to sync my iPhone 4 or another iPod-I can.  I think that's pretty standard now-but some of the cheeps ones off of eBay do not have this option.-Dual charging capability.  While I do not know how much slower it will charge the device-the fact that I could charge another USB item at the same time if needed is important and a great option to have for a passenger iPhone, Kindle, iPad, Navigation system, etc.-Very small profile so not big and bulky.-Cord for syncing is just the right length of not too short, but not too long.Potential negatives-Tough to see in the picture, but the device that goes in your cigarette lighter is VERY small and could be hard to get out.  I was shocked when I saw how small it was.  It may be that others have had problems with this and there certainly is not a lot of room to grasp this thing to take it out, but just enough for me.Overall, a great value at this price when the Apple version is twice as much with only 1 USB charger.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0042B82W6" id="B0042B82W6-review51" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-06-26:</strong> This thing rocks.

Wire wound around a form touches the 12V lead from the socket, so when the thin varnish on the winding wears through... POOF. (See the picture I uploaded.) Visible smoke curls up and your device is fried. My Moto DroidX survived, apparently because Motorola knows how to buffer input power so a 12V surge from a 5V USB port won't do any damage, but Garmin doesn't do that.Not worth the risk. Use a manufacturer cord. It would be easy to anticipate and avoid this problem, but Griffin and the Ford Pinto are in the same category.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0042B82W6" id="B0042B82W6-review53" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-05:</strong> The wire works good.

It's quite a popular model, yet I have trouble finding solutions to advancing technology that fit my vehicle AND wallet. This dual charger is exactly the type of simple and elegant upgrade I was hoping to make and luckily, Griffin and Amazon were there in the clutch as usual.The outlet in my A6 is hidden within a hide-away drawer at the bottom-center of my dash (below radio). Normally, car chargers are large and long. This not only fits perfectly within my hidden outlet, it also allows me to leave this dual charge in the outlet at all times - even when I need to close the drawer when the charger isn't in use. As others have mentioned, this may or may not sit flush with your outlet, but in my case (01 Audi A6) it fits perfectly, leaving just enough space for my pudgy fingers to pull the dual charger out with ease.Overall this is a fantastic charger and these days, it's a must.NOT TO MENTION THE BONUS CABLE!!!! I SAW A SIMILAR DUAL CHARGER FOR $3 MORE ON AMAZON THAT DIDN'T HAVE THIS CABLE. THIS IS THE WAY TO GO!

The charger is convenient to have when you need to charge your phone on a long trip.

Why?  I walk to work most days, and when I do go somewhere it's usually within an hour's drive.  However, we recently took a long weekend trip and needed to recharge phones en route.This phone charger performed like a champ.  It fits snugly into the power socket in the car and charged our phones as quickly as they charge when we plug them into wall outlets at home.There are two improvements I would suggest, though these are not fatal flaws:1) How about an indicator light to let you know that the unit is seated completely in the power outlet?2) It would  be really nice if the coiled cord was a bit longer.  OK, a little more about this one...When I was riding along and trying to use my phone while it was plugged in the cord length was not quite long enough to reach from the power outlet, which is actually in a console between the front seats and my ear while seated up front.  I gave it some healthy tugs and stretches, but it was still a little short but not too bad after that.  It will take some more limbering up and additional stretching and then it may reach all the way with no problem.All in all a solid charger that does what it's designed to do, but with only minor issues.I give this unit a strong 4-stars</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HFEJNNO" id="B00HFEJNNO-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-28:</strong> The Samsung OEM wall charger that came with my Samsung Galaxy S4 has a stated output of 2.0 amps and this Amazon Basics car charger charges my Galaxy S4 as quickly as that wall charger.

I previously used an OEM Samsung car charger, theSamsung OEM Car Charger for Samsung Galaxy S4, Galaxy S3, Galaxy Note 2 and More (Bulk Packaging), which has an output of only .7 amps and takes quite a while to charge my phone.  So, this Amazon Basics car charger has now permanently replaced this Samsung car charger as my "go to" car charger.The coiled cord is stiff to operate, but it is long enough to be fully functional within the confines of my car.

It goes probably double that, but 2.5 feet has been a very comfortable length for normal use. Using my Moto-G while plugged in works fine with the coiled feature, but you really shouldn't be on your phone while your car is moving (hangs head in shame). The only major consideration in purchasing the Universal Car Charger for Android is thus the length of the cord. I love the coiled feature as I'm always having straight cords get tangled in my gear shift, brake handle, etc. and this keeps things a lot cleaner. It also sits a lot nicer in the glove box which is pretty cluttered also. When I pick up my Moto-G it easily stretches for use, then gets compact again when I reholster my phone.So, I plugged in my Moto-G and the micro USB connector slid in perfectly yet wasn't loose telling me the machined tolerances are solid. Tugging the phone to speak there was no hint that it would come out and I could hold the phone up by the cord. It also pops out with a reasonable tug. YMMV since you may have a different phone, obviously. It charged my Moto about as quickly as I would expect, though I'm more likely to rely on this as on the go power and to keep my phone topped off.Amazon has these manufactured to spec in China, as with probably all of the AmazonBasics line. I have had zero problems with all of the Basics products such as USB cables, wall warts, etc. Simple product, good quality, works. That 5 out of 5 stars for me.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HFEJNNO" id="B00HFEJNNO-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-12:</strong> The car charger works great, especially for devices that require more than the typical 0.5 A limit found on typical devices.However, the cord length of 4.9 feet may be somewhat misleading.  While the coiled wire is welcome in terms of avoiding &#34;self-entanglement&#34;, I found that the &#34;recoil&#34; on the cord to make its effective length about half that amount.  When I'm trying to charge my Galaxy S3, I was fighting the recoil a bit and found the cord yanking out if I stretched it too long.To be fair, however, my phone is getting quite old (and heavily used) and I think the charging receptacle isn't what it used to be in terms of holding a cable properly.  That said, I was able to use the cord to about 1/2 its advertised length with minimal fighting.  I think that you'll find that with ANY coiled solution, but the buyer should be aware.With a 2.1 Amp output, however, I'd still recommend this.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HFEJNNO" id="B00HFEJNNO-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-19:</strong> I used this product with my Galaxy S4 and have been thrilled with it's performance.  While most car chargers don't offer the same amount of power as a wall charger, this one seems to, usually charging my phone about halfway on my 40 minute evening commute, even when using it to talk with Bluetooth on.The only problem is one of personal annoyance which may or may not apply to you.  I hate how springy the cord is, invariably I will have it snap from my hand several times before getting it in the charger.  I'm probably just more of a spaz than the average person, but this is the first charger I've ever experienced this with.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HFEJNNO" id="B00HFEJNNO-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-15:</strong> I've uses a similar (slight more advanced) car charger for mini-usb, so I gave this one to my daughter.

Very disappointed. I had but ONE DAY remaining to be able to return for a replacement, and see that it is "out of stock" and not available for delivery until September?!?!?The LED went out, that normally indicates you are connected to a DC outlet in your car. Two other chargers work fine in that same outlet, and this unit does not work in any outlets in the vehicle (three were tried).The internal fuse of the unit is intact, has not blown, and there was no abnormal indication or use of the smartphone. I noticed that the charging unit had failed when the phone's icon for battery life remaining was far lower than normal.I limped along with the factory charging cord, which cannot keep up with both the phone in-use and charging the phone's battery.Although I'm glad Amazon's policy will cover a return and replacement, I hope the failure of this unit is not part of the China Syndrome of cheap products and poor quality control.Will update this review in a couple of months....-------(Original review follows. I had rated this device at four stars.)The higher power of this car charger allows me to get ahead of how much current the phone draws when I'm using it for navigation at full screen brilliance.The phone, a Motorola Razr Maxx, already has a beefy battery, but its extra capacity requires increased charging ability to bring it up to full.This device does that well.Car chargers with less power spend most of their time struggling to keep up with power demands of a smartphone that's being used.  As a result, there's very little capacity left to actually charge the phone's battery, so it will take far longer than if you turn off the phone, or when using the somewhat stronger home charger.It's important to note that this charger shows no sign of overpowering the phone, which would present a risk of cooking the battery or burning up the phone's voltage regulator circuitry that governs the charging rate.  Instead, because the phone operates normally, I conclude that this unit has the ability to supplement the power demanded by the phone, along with being able to recharge the battery.Recommended.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00HFEJNNO" id="B00HFEJNNO-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-31:</strong> Car chargers at the big cell phone company stores are very expensive, so it&#8217;s good to have a basic alternative to provide a charge while on the go.The AmazonBasics Micro USB Universal Car Charger for Android has an output of 2.1 amps.

My phone (Motorola Android based) My tablets (Kindle Fire and Kindle E-book readers) all accepted the charge without any fuss. Even couple of my Sony cameras accepted this charger as well. This ONE charger in your glove box will come handy for multitude of devices when needed.

However, at best, they might be able to prevent the phone from dying while in use. Why is that? Well the Galaxy Note 3 is a larger and powerful phone, which normally uses a 2.0 amp charger. Most car chargers either can't provide this or only work at full amperage with fruit products.So enter the AmazonBasics Micro USB universal charger to save the day. For my test and typical use-case scenario, I put my phone on my dash mount, fired up some navigation software (Waze, in this instance), maxed out the screen brightness, and went for a drive. Should also note I keep all radio's on at all times, including Bluetooth for hands-free calling, Wi-Fi, 4G/LTE, and GPS, of course.After about 15-20 minutes, the battery percentage had actually increased by 5%. Success!  If this was any less than 2.0 amp, that simply wouldn't happen.Beyond that there isn't much to say. It's a basic charger design with a coiled cable that's just the right length. While it may go to over 4 ft, it was pretty stiff going past 3 ft. Although I already got that impression from the pictures Amazon posted. And for most dashes, this is more than enough. Any longer and you'll want a straight cable.Overall, I consider it highly recommended for any Android user - even though it will likely work with plenty others.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00HFEJNNO', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00HFEJNNO', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B0088LVMIM</h2>    <p class="price"> $B0088LVMIM</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

I'm a fan of Anker products because so far I havent been let down. They are fantastic cases for the price and this case is no exception. I love that there is an option to add the ring around the case. I'm not sure if they actually intended on using the phone like this but I have been using it with and without the PC ring for about 2 weeks. With the ring around the phone it makes it sleek and sets it off with the matte finish coating and the added shine of the PC frame. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the PC ring is a bit loose on mine, its not really noticeable until you grab the phone and this could also be a defect with the case I got. Not even that big of a deal or I would have returned it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009DHJOPS" id="B009DHJOPS-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-03:</strong> I have had this case for about a month now.  This is by far the best Iphone 5 Case on the market for price and style.  At the time I purchased this case for $3.99! It was probably on sale but would pay the retail of $9.99 without hesitation.The case is great for the price but also for the style.  It keeps the phone very slim and that is the point with owning an iphone.  While the case offers a great look and protection against scratches and daily use, it would not protect against drops (in my opinion) on Concrete.  It probably would depend how the phone is dropped and how far but a big drop I believe could still crack the screen which comes to my next point of getting a screen protector for it.  I personally have the Spaigen T glass screen protector which fits perfectly with this case and hopefully would provide protection on the screen if dropped.A side note would be the headphone jack is definitely small and for example I use to connect this with my aux cable in my car and had to buy a new 'skinny' aux head cable to fit in the phone.  If you have headphones that have a large connector it might not fit in the headphone jack.Overall amazing phone case and definitely recommend.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009DHJOPS" id="B009DHJOPS-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-23:</strong> I received my case form Anker about a week ago and started using it the same day. The design is pretty straight forward, first you place the silicone (tpu) sleeve around the phone and then put the plastic bumper like piece over the tpu it will make a faint click sound to let you know that it is done properly. The feel of the case and look is great. There was no flashing issues on any part of the case so the quality control is there (for those who do not know what flashing is, cheaper cases usually have some rough plastic areas that arent smoothed down). I also dropped my phone with this case on and it survived the fall from a couple of feet. The cut outs for the case are great with 1 exception. The vibrate switch was very hard for me to get to. I have short finger nails and it was almost impossible for me to switch the switch back and forth. This isnt the only case out there that has this issue, and its to be expected when you are for the most part adding 2 layers of protection but its annoying none the less. If you are looking for a great quality case that has a few color choices and dont want to spend a lot id recommend this case over getting other brands like incipio or speck because with those companies you are paying 80% for the name, 20% for the product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009DHJOPS" id="B009DHJOPS-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-01:</strong> TPU inner case add just a little more protection than your standard case and the outer ring holds everything in place nicely. Buttons are very responsive even with the case on.Update December 8, 2012. Well, I had to send my first case back because of scratching around the protective plastic band. I just received my replacement case, and it has the same scratches. It looks like a combination of cheap plastic, and the tight packaging seems to mark up the band.

I was very impressed with it. The TPU body scared me at first. I usually don't like TPU cases. This came with a twist, it came with a frame to hold it in place. I have to admit, this was going to be a nice backup case, until something cool came down the line. I might just keep it as my primary one. All the cuts where perfect for the volume and lock buttons. I has a nice border the goes pass the screen a little bit, for people at are afraid of dropping it on the corner of the screen. This will help keep the glass screen safe from cracking on small falls. I would recommend this product to anyone, very impressed.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009DHJOPS" id="B009DHJOPS-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-29:</strong> This case is very slim and fits the iPhone 5 very well.

Two minor quibbles: The cutout for the headphone jack could be a little bigger and the mute switch is a little too recessed.

The case is a 2 piece tpu material with a polybarbonate  bumper ring, I will say that the ring that wraps around the case is very thin so becarful on how you take this off it seem it may be easy to snap. Another like I have on the case is that it has a translucent frosted matt back that will show off your 5 and has a very minimal bezel that will lift your case placeing it face down on a table.My only gripe on the case that I could find is that I wish that the power button could protrude a little higher from the case, it's  alittle flush but is still easy to press. As for the volume buttons those are very easy to press and protrude a bit more than the power button. Also my other gripe is the big branding ANKER on the side of the case it's a small gripe but would have thought a engraved branding would have looked better like other cases do.I have used this case for about a week and I like it alot. I also dropped my phone in this case a survived the drop with no damage to the phone and should protect from normal drops.I purchased this case for only 3.99 with 5 dollar shipping! If you want slim minimal bulk, protection, good quality and don't wanna pay too much then this case is for you! I recomend this case in white frost too for the iphone 5 in white as I have both colors.Note: The head phonejack is small and will not fit your thicker jacks I own the klipsch s4i, v moda vibrato and these will fit. I would make sure your headphone jack is a slimline design before you purchase!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009DHJOPS" id="B009DHJOPS-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-20:</strong> not bad and protects well.  i've purchased a bunch but this is a very good case for the iphone 5.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009DHJOPS" id="B009DHJOPS-review21" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-07:</strong> After just receiving this case, I must say I am quite happy with it. I first had trouble deciding if the "bumper" would go adjacent to the iPhone or if the actual case would be against the iPhone first. After looking at the picture again on Amazon, it made sense that the case would go in first.Quality wise, the entire case set up is good. It seems durable and not flimsy at all. It has the phone intact and does not seem like it will fall out at all which is a plus.One thing that is a drawback is how rigid the bumper is; I feel it could have been a bit more durable and gripped closer to the case but that could be personal preference. Also, the vibrate button is a bit too inside and kind of hard to get to until you get used to it.Overall, the case does its purpose and at the price point, it is a no-brainer. Solid, firm, and protective are three words I'd use to describe the product.4 out 5 from me.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B009DHJOPS', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B009DHJOPS', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B0031MFOEQ</h2>    <p class="price"> $B0031MFOEQ</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

I had the black silicone snap-on case from Verizon and liked it initially but fell out of love for several reasons.  I finally stumbled on the Seidio Innocase Surface and it is PERFECT.  Forget everything else, this is THE case to own for the Motorola Droid.PROS:- Perfect fit (no gaps)- Easy to install AND to remove- Provides extra grip around the Droid- Perfect cutouts- Durable plastic material w/soft coating- Does not pick up lintCONS:- AvailabilityThe best part of the Seidio Innocase is the perfect fit and solid build.  The cutouts for volume, camera, power, microUSB port, headphone jack, mic, camera lens, and speaker are spot on perfect.  My old Verizon snap-on cover covered all the buttons so it wasn't easy to always get a good feel for where the buttons were.  My old case also covered all but a 3rd of the speaker on the back, which I never could figure out why.  The Innocase reveals the entire rear speaker.  The plastic snap-on case by Seidio is coated with a soft material so that it almost feels like a rubber case.  I had Seidio cases for my old Blackberry Curve as well.I also like the top part because it's rigid enough that when I swipe the screen from side to side, the sides of the case do not flex.  My old VZW case flexed so much that it eventually felt like it was going to fall off.  The cutout for the mic is also done very nicely and I hope it improves the audio quality as I had problems sounding muffled with the VZW case.  The entire case is also very easy to install and also to remove.  I nearly bought theOEM Body Glovecase but read a LOT of complaints about how difficult it was to remove and how it added significant bulk.The Seidio Innocase Surface case for the Motorola Droid is absolute perfection.  You can really tell that a lot of thought went into the design.  It is also very slim and adds only the tiniest amount of extra bulk.  If you wish you could keep your Droid naked, but don't want to risk it, this is your best solution.  It's not a mil spec Otterbox case, but who among us really need that level of protection?  Go buy this today, in two colors, if you can find it in stock.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0031MFOEQ" id="B0031MFOEQ-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-04-08:</strong> I almost always have something negative to say about anything I buy, but not this Seidio Innocase for the Motorola Droid. It is the perfect design.- Takes seconds to install- Very, very slim design (almost looks like you don't have a case on)- Ports for everything (headphone jack, USB, camera, external speaker)- Physical keyboard slides out with no issues- Does a fantastic job of protecting your phone (dropped on concrete from 3 feet while working on car, and didn't even drop my call)- inexpensive- Looks cool- Non-slip, actually makes it easier to holdThe only con I could come up with is if you want to use a magnetic car holder, the case is some sort of polymer, and therefore non-magnetic. If that's an issue, then sure, go elsewhere, but otherwise, stop looking and buy it.(No, I don't work for them, I just love a well engineered product, which this is)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0031MFOEQ" id="B0031MFOEQ-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-27:</strong> Nicely protective and with a good texture for holding without being abrasive.

I started my case hunt with the Body Glove hard rubberized case.  It caused a little too much resistance when sliding open the keyboard and it was very hard to remove the case if I needed to access the micro-SD card, pop out the battery to reset my phone, or place the Droid in a dock or cradle.  My next attempt was the snap-on silicone case offered at the Verizon store.  That case completely blocked my keyboard from sliding open.  I searched the web for suggestions and all signs pointed to the Seidio Innocase Surface.  I saw that the case had great reviews on Amazon and decided to give it a shot.  Boy, I'm glad I did.  The cover snaps on and off very easily.  There is no resistance at all when sliding open the phone.  Both pieces feel very secure and the case adds virtually no bulk to the phone (the Body Glove adds significantly more bulk, but does feel as if it would offer better protection in the event of drops).  The texture has a very smooth rubbery feel and is a bit slippery.  It's stylish but definitely not for the butter-fingered.  The Innocase also easily shows smudges if your fingers are moist or oily, but they rub right off.  I read the reports of top pieces popping off for some users.  I have not experienced this problem and it doesn't appear imminent.  My case seems very well made.  Seidio offers accessories, such as car windshield mounts and desktop cradles, that work with the Droid in the Innocase. This is definitely the best case out of the few I've tried.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0031MFOEQ" id="B0031MFOEQ-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-08-24:</strong> The case is a perfect fit on the phone. I seem to do things that would mess up most phones but this case is a big help to protect the phone. I have the clip to wear the phone on my belt and it is equally sturdy and works as advertised.

On the plus side, this is the slimmest hard case on the market for the Droid.  It offers good protection from normal wear and tear, but I have not tried dropping the phone onto concrete to see if the case offers serious protection.  All the controls are accessible through the case and I do not have any problem with the keyboard like some people are reporting (maybe depends on the size of your fingers or how you hold the phone).On the minus side, the case does make the phone noticeably thicker and bulkier.  I used my phone naked for a month before buying the case and the phone does feel much bigger with the case on.  On the other hand, the case is comfortable in my hands and easier to hold securely than with no case.  Typing on the keyboard is probably easier than with no case because of the additional grip.Also, you cannot use the Motorola desk cradle or car cradle with this case on.  Seidio makes their own cradles that work with this case, but theirs are more expensive than Motorola's (much more expensive for the car cradle).  You can remove the case to put the phone in one of the Motorola cradles, but the case is not designed for frequent removal and I'm guessing that it will break if you do this very often.  Note that you do need to remove the case (at least the back piece) if you need to change the battery or SD card.I wouldn't pay the original $25 for this case, but now that the price has dropped to $15, it may be worth trying if you're thinking about a hard case.Otterbox also makes a quality hard case for the Motorola Droid.  It is reportedly sturdier, but also even bigger and bulkier.  If you use your phone a lot in dirty or dusty conditions, the Otter case has gaskets covering all the phones buttons (though it is not waterproof).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0031MFOEQ" id="B0031MFOEQ-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-06-21:</strong> Like others have said, I too have the dreaded scratch on my driodI've had this case for two weeks now and I noticed that my phone now has an inch long (but thin) scratch to the left of the verizon logo (only viewable when the keyboard is open) that was caused by this case. One of the tabs that hold the top section in place (lower left tab for the screen cover) is rubbing against the bottom section of the phone every time it is slid open to use the keyboard.If it were not for this problem, I would rate it 5 stars, the rest of the case is great.There must be a problem with one of the mold cavities (molds are multi cavity so they make more than 1 part each time the mold is used) and some people have reported this problem and some have not due to what I am guessing is a tolerance issue with one of the tabs.Unfortunately,  have one of the bad ones.There are enough people now that are complaining about this, but not all, that is why I think they have a bad mold cavity.Good luck with your case!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0031MFOEQ" id="B0031MFOEQ-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-01-08:</strong> This case looks the best of any case for the Droid Motorola (original) so far.

I used double-sided tape to keep it on the phone because I really don't want to buy another case as this is really the best one i've found.Edit/Update: After a few months, all of the little teeth/edges that hold this case to the phone have chipped off.

I also purchased a Verizon snap on case with a holster.  The verizon casing and holster are well made but more bulky.  It was also difficult for me to place my Droid into the Verizon holster because it has to slide in exactly straight or else you won't get it in there.  I usually had to use two hands to place the phone back into the holster.  It kind of defeats the purpose of a holster if you need to use two hands.  The Verizon model was easy to take out of the holster,  just hard to put back in.  When I received the Seidio and took it out of the packaging it seemed cheaply made to me compared to the Verizon model.  I chose to put the Seidio on anyway and try it out. The Seidio case had received many excellent reviews so I definitely wanted to give it a try.  Here is what I found.The Seidio case & holster is much sleeker and attractive than the Verizon model.  The verizon model is thicker and heavier than the Seidio.  The Seidio holster is a one handed operation which I LOVE!  I can put the phone in and take the phone out of the holster without a problem.  The casing itself feels great in my hands compared to the rough and edgy Verizon model. This case also has a larger opening for the speaker on the back of the phone.  Why Verizon's model is cut smaller, I cannot comprehend so Seidio wins on that  fact too.  The design of this case is terrific.  It is more costly than most of the cases on Amazon but I don't think you will find a nicer looking and more well designed model than the Seidio.  Now if Amazon only carried Seidio's Innocase Car Kit.....  I would be set to go!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0031MFOEQ" id="B0031MFOEQ-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-02-26:</strong> Apparently, either Seidio dropped the ball, or Motorola changed the dimensions of the phone after Seidio created it, but whatever the root cause, the front half of the case won't stay attached.

I bought it from Verizon with my discount for around the same price here. I like how you snap the case together and you can use it as a standalone without the holster and also just slide it into the holster if you want to use it. I just had one issue with this thing. When using the small face cover it has the raised edges at the bottom the length of the back and search touch keys. I usually push those with my thumb holding it with one hand while in calls to look for something or just out of habit. It is awkward with the raised edges to do this.

However it didn't stay on.I have read that some of the earlier cases had a "Fitting" problem that was resolved in later manufactured cases.  I sent an email to Seidio and they sent me a link to a webform to fill out and upload a scan of the sales receipt.  They have put a replacement case in the mail and hopefully this one will stay on the phone.The case itself is very nice.  Fits very snugly and appears to almost be a part of the phone until you look closely. Compared to other droid cases it has a much snugger fit.  I did alot of research before ordering this case.  It was by far the highest rated, with the only complaints being with the front covers of some not staying on (like in my case).  It would have been nice if they could have tracked down the bad cases and had them returned to Seidio so customers would not have to go through this hassal.Assuming the case stays on as it is designed to when I get my replacement I would upgrade this review to 4 1/2 stars..  The cut outs are all well placed for the buttons and openings on the phone for earphones and charger connection.One bonus it seems, is that a naked droid appears to have problems coming off of silent mode when the volume rocker is accidently depressed while moving around in your pocket.  I have read complaints about this in the Droid forums.However, I have not had this issue, as I have kept the back case on my phone and it appears to offer protoection from the volume rocker accientaly being depressed while in your pocket.  The case creates a recessed area where each button is.I would recommend this case to anyone with a Droid with the caustion that they hang on to their receipt in the event they get one of the earlier manufactured cases with the front covers that won't stay on.You can avoid this problem by buying directly from the Seidio website, but it will cost you a little more in price.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0031MFOEQ" id="B0031MFOEQ-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-07-06:</strong> At first I was very pleased with this product.  It fit my Motorola DROID snugly and works wonderfully with the other SEIDIO products like their docking station and car dock.Less than three months later, however, two of the tabs that hold the cover in place have completely worn down and disappeared.  The top cover will no longer stay in place by itself.  The good news is that SEIDIO offers a 180 day warranty.  The bad news is that upon requesting a replacement, I had to wait 3 business days for a response to my request.  I then have to mail the defective part back to them and then "allow 1-2 weeks for processing" after which they will mail the replacement.  That means at least two weeks without a cover for my phone.  And this for an item I ordered directly from SEIDIO.  What I'm most concerned about is that, if this is the design of this item, I imagine it will suffer the same problem repeatedly, needing to be replaced every three months.  While I use my phone frequently, I am gentle with it and the cover has not been removed since I originally put it on, so there has not been excessive wear and tear.A previous item of theirs (the docking station) I ordered from a separate vendor originally arrived defective.  I requested an RMA from them and was over a week into the process before they told me they could not replace it because I bought it from an outside vendor.  I had to go through that vendor because it was defective within 10 days of the purchase.  That vendor was not Amazon, but I mention it here so that people can be aware of the customer service they can expect should something go wrong with any of SEIDIO's products.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0031MFOEQ" id="B0031MFOEQ-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-01-18:</strong> This is a fairly nice case.  Unfortunately it only lasted about 3 months until the little tabs the hold the front cover on broke off.  I'm not sure how I'm supposed to give it more than one star since it didn't last long enough to be any better than the $5 cases you can get here.  Sadly I think that the biggest weakness of all of the cases for the phones that slide open to reveal the keyboard is that they are two piece and I can't see a way to make them more durable.  Seems like it would be better to just avoid phones with slide out keyboards.I don't see a point in asking for my money back since it's just a phone case and the hassle of sending it back isn't worth it.  I just won't buy another case from Seidio since they only sell high-priced cases.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0031MFOEQ" id="B0031MFOEQ-review26" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-04-06:</strong> I have been reading on the reviews that some people were unfortunate enough to receive front face plates that did not fit the droid properly.  Unless you were shipped a defective product, there is no reason to give this case anything less than a 5.  It literally is the perfect case for the Droid.It's thin, but just thick enough that on a bad fall it really will protect the corners.  It will definitely protect the droid from scratches, and the battery cover from popping off / getting moisture in it.Because of the nature of the Droid (being a slide phone and all) it will not offer the same protection as a case designed for a solid body phone...  But so what, the keyboard on the droid is worth it.This paired with the "High Quality Screen Protector Film Guard for Verizon Motorola Droid A855" is perfect to protect your new phone.I say this after having tried out Verizon's see through plastic "snap-on hardcover" case for the droid which by comparison is much bulkier and cheaper looking.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0031MFOEQ" id="B0031MFOEQ-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-06-27:</strong> Bought the extended battery, and the innocase front and back for the extended battery to use on my moto droid.The battery, in less than 90 days has come apart.The case back is ok.The case front pops off whenever it feels like it and is useless at this point. All within a matter of a few months.Seidio will replace their garbage with new garbage, after going through a dog and pony show and giving you 7 days to respond to their RMA which they send via email. 7 days from when they sent the email, which means if you don't get it due to spam filtering or other issues,  you're screwed.A defect like a battery coming apart and a case wearing out because the tabs are not good enough should be covered by a refund more than just 14 days. They know it's crap.There are other covers that are on the market that are made better, fit cleaner and stay on. Seidio is overpriced foreign crap pushing their sweatshop products into the American market just like every other 3rd world country is doing right now. Just because they have a website doesn't mean their a good company.Like crap, buy Seidio.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0031MFOEQ" id="B0031MFOEQ-review28" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-05-19:</strong> I'm a case freak, I get a case for everything I possibly can.  Some case are great, some so-so and some are worthless.  This case is amazing.  First and formost it is a PERFECT fit for the Moto Droid.  Even the slide down keyboard works with no hangups (a lot of Droid cases hang up at first until they get "broken"in).  The case has ample room around buttons and plugs and has NO slop around the edges.  I love the feel of this case- it is exactly like the feel of the back of the droid.  Grippy with out feeling tacky.  My Droid still slips in and out of the holster with ease, but I never feel like I'm going to drop it when pulling it out.  There are 4 Droid owners in my family and we all have different cases- but mine is by far the nicest, and the other 3 owners are looking for an excuse to break their current case so they can get this one (funny thing is that mine was NOT the most expensive case!)  I have dropped my Droid twice (from hip high onto tile floor) with no ill effects.

You know sooner or later you are going to drop your cell phone.  It is heartbreaking to see physical damage that could have easily been prevented.The case fits well, looks nice, and does not add bulk to the phone.The Problems:I use my Motorola Car Dock all the time.  The phone will not fit into the dock with the Seidio back cover on.I like to use my Motorola Charging dock.  The phone can't make an electrical connection to charge with the back cover on.The Seidio front cover slightly blocks the top row of the slide out keyboard.  It is not by much but the top row of keys on the slide out keyboard is not easy to use as is.  I have found the horizontal on screen keyboard more user friendly anyway.My Conclusion:Buy the cover and only use the front if you find yourself in the same situation as I do.  It is much better to protect the front screen then not have any protection.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0031MFOEQ" id="B0031MFOEQ-review30" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-30:</strong> Doesn't last. front frame cracks and falls off and the rest of the case fits so tight it cracks when going from hot to cold environment.

But once I disconnect the call, they link back up and work fine.This is the first headset I've had that doesn't fall off my little ears. I use the smallest earpiece of the three it came with and it works really well for me. I can wear the Voyager 510 for 45 minutes or so before my ear starts feeling annoyed with it. Thankfully it easily changes to fit the other ear.So far the talk time and stand-by time have been really good. I've talked for a few hours without having to recharge it.The answer/disconnect and volume buttons are placed well and work easily.

This was my error and not an indication of the quality of the headset.I am replacing it with the exact same thing as this is the best headset I've had the experience of using. I've had several over the years...jabra, another plantronics. The 510 Voyager has the best audio clarity of them all and people tell me my voice sounds clear and strong. Some people can't believe I'm using my cell-pone.The only thing I don't like about this headset is the on-off button can be difficult to press. It's just a bad design of that particular feature but all things considered, I think this headset is an outstanding bargain considering it's performance.UPDATE: March 4, 2009: Unfortunately I've had to return the "Recertified" Voyager 510 because the battery life was not per specifications or what I was accustomed to with my previous 510. The battery did not hold a charge for very long thus the talk time and standby time was diminished.

IT IS NOT A DOCK.  You still need to connect a car charging cable and an audio cable to the phone to get decent audio.  I give it four stars four what it actually does and what is provided in the description.There is a certain segment of hardcore Android users who are still crying (as you can read in these reviews) because Samsung didn't create a dock for the Verizon Galaxy Nexus that uses the beloved  3 "pogo" pins that are on the right side of the VZW Galaxy Nexus.  Samsung did make a dock like this for the GSM version of the Galaxy Nexus and Google sells it on the Google Play store.  Your VZW Galaxy Nexus WILL NOT fit in that dock because the VZW Galaxy Nexus is slightly thicker than that version because it has 4G LTE.  Honestly, it's not that big of a deal.  It's not that hard to plug in two cables and who honestly leaves their mount on the windshield 24 hours a day as an invitation for thieves to smash your window. So you'd still be constantly disconnecting the cables anyway unless you want a mess of wires running under your seat where you'd stash the dock while parked.The Nexus looks fantastic when in the mount, but getting it in there seems to put a lot of sideway pressure on the volume and power buttons so I am concerned about those eventually breaking.  Getting it out of the mount is also difficult.  You usually need to apply significant pressure through one of the slots on the back in order to pop the Nexus out.  Maybe there is a release mechanism but I haven't figured it out.  The windshield suction cup mechanism works fantastic and is very secure.  I am glad I purchased this as it is 1000% times better than holding the phone while driving and it works much better than a universal mount.That being said I honestly would not pay more than $30 for this mount.  But I'd take it over a universal mount which will lack the same connectivity options and won't be designed to fit the Nexus as this one is.  I snagged a used one for $10 off off Amazon and it works like new.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006NYP61K" id="B006NYP61K-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-14:</strong> so i bought this MOUNT. i know what a mount is vs a car dock. the car dock is for the non-US gsm versions.. it fits the US version but u have to mod it and if u dont do it correctly u are screwed. lolso my review of this is: it works.it fits securely in there - like a glove.suction cups work really wellsimple, easy to use, cheap.the headphone jack and the charging micro usb jack are easily seen and reached by cables..so many people grip about it not being a dock.. whats the difference???????? the dock - u plug the cables into the base, and the 3 pins charge the unit and u can still plug an aux cable.. so for this unit instead of plugging into the base u plug right into the phone. whats the big deal?ohhh yea - the car dock software. just go get one on the market?[...]done.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006NYP61K" id="B006NYP61K-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-05:</strong> This mount does not have the 3 pins to make it a true car dock.

The material is more durable than silicone, and has a nicer feel to it.  Additionally, it has just the right amount of flexibility to absorb some of the force of the impact from an accidental drop.  I've used all kinds of cases  (at all different price points) for all of my smartphones, but TPU does the best at protecting the devices.The amusing icons on the back of this case are cute, but the selling point is really the fit (which is perfect) and the material.

You can use it for your iPad, I suppose.The only down side to the holster/case combo is that the &#34;on&#34; switch is usually triggered when I remove the phone from the holster.

You can pivot the belt clip. You can access the s-pen easily without worrying about it falling out (the holster has a notch which covers the pen). And the whole thing is amply minimal to keep your already-gigantic phone from becoming truly behemoth.EDIT: After a bit of use, I have noticed that holster isn't terribly secure. Since the phone slides easily into the holster, occasionally I will find that the phone has slid partially out of the holster. I haven't had the phone fall yet, but have found it half-way out a number of times.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AHQC88O" id="B00AHQC88O-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-27:</strong> I owned a blackberry and loved the belt clip case that went with it. When I purchased the GN2, I wanted something very similar. I couldn't find a case out there that I liked. Came across this item and so far it works. I have a slim case already on my phone and it's not an issue to use with the belt clip case. It's light and durable and clips easily on your pants waist or even a pocket. Because of the size of the phone it wasn't feasible to hang on the front of my pants. I literally clipped it to my back pocket and had my walk in the park. I actually faced the phone inward on the case to protect the face of the phone. I wasn't concerned about answering a call because I can easily slide it out but the case is light enough to be used while on a call. Not sure I will use the stylus that came with it or the secondary case for the kick stand. I could in the future maybe. The style is simple enough that being a woman and marginally concerned about it looking feminine, not an issue. It's a belt clip case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AHQC88O" id="B00AHQC88O-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-02:</strong> nice case, my only reason for it not getting 5 stars is the rubber inner case is just too flimsy.  needs to be a bit more durable.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AHQC88O" id="B00AHQC88O-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-03:</strong> This case was a perfect fit for our Note II, great protection for your device + looks great, clip is sturdy.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00AHQC88O', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00AHQC88O', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B003XQG7HI</h2>    <p class="price"> $B003XQG7HI</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

It actually got a couple small scratches when I was applying it.  It doesn't seem to scratch now though.  The scratches may be on the back side.  Also, if your hands are hot or sweaty, it will be very difficult to slide your fingers across the screen.  They kind of stick.  I get around this by wrapping my shirt around my finger.

I went to the mall and spent my 25 bucks to have them put it on my Captivate for me so that I'd have a beautiful bubble free end result. It looked good but the euphoria only lasted about hour.This is no exaggeration. It totally ruined the screen response. Both the home and back buttons at the bottom of the screen required multiple hard presses and I could no longer text accurately using my Swype. While dragging from letter to another I'd get "skips" which garbled the input. This was no better that the one dollar product I had purchased from ebay a week earlier. But it was far more aggravating given that cost was many times higher and I actually drive to the mall to have them put it on.My theory was complete proven when I peeled off this $25 waste and my screen sensitive was back to normal. The marketing machine for ZAGG makes a big deal about the strength and scratch resistance of this product. When asked, their reps are trained to tell you it does not affect screen sensitivity. If decide you take their word for it, just be sure you ask if you can get a refund if you are not satisfied with how their product handles that one aspect of functionality. As it stands, they only replace it if it get scratched.Otherwise, don't get near these people.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003XQG7HI" id="B003XQG7HI-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-10:</strong> Got this for my grandma and her new phone, and it works really well.

I don't understand why people complain about the installation.  Just watch a couple Youtube videos on how to install and you're good.  I've installed these on four devices now with no issue's.  A iPhone 4s is my primary.  This one I did have to remove it once I had pressed the solution out but it was my mistake.  Zagg allows 3-5 minutes for removal and re-install but I don't recommend it.  Sometimes the removal stretches the screen protector.  My mistake during install was not holding down the opposite side which i'm pressing so the SP doesnt move.  Also, I found using a lot of the solution allows for easy install.  Don't be stingy with the solution cause in the end, it's only one SP per package(unless noted) so use a lot.  Just keep a terry cloth handy to wipe the excess water from the sides(not on the screen prior to install as it will leave particles) and press to the sides.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003XQG7HI" id="B003XQG7HI-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-24:</strong> It's mediocre.

Here are the things I like about the phone:* The phone is a nice size, it's lighter than my HTC EVO 4G.* The processor is one of the fastest US released Android phone, and it comes with 2 GB of RAM.* I played around with the camera and video camera and the quality is great in my opinion. (I'll post some pics or a video later.)* The ICS 4.0 is really snappy and it opens up applications quickly.* It comes with Google Wallet. I signed up and got a free $10 to use. (I'm going to McDonald's to test it out!)* I've only use the S Voice application a few times, but it seems to be just like Siri on my wife's iPhone 4S.* It comes with a micro SD slot in case more space is needed to save pictures, videos, etc.* You can change out the battery if needed.* Battery life last twice as long compared to my HTC EVO 4G.Now for some cons:* This is carrier related and not the phone itself, but the 4G LTE is not all in all areas so be sure to check your carrier if internet speeds is a deciding factor in purchasing this phone. If not you'll be stuck with 3G speeds.* The phone is so nice, that I baby it all the time!I was on the fence about getting this phone or the HTC EVO 4G LTE aka HTC One X. The main things that I like over the the Samsung Galaxy 3 over the HTC EVO 4G LTE is that it comes with the Micro SD slot and also the battery can be changed if it ever goes bad.I love this phone! :)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00891PTQM" id="B00891PTQM-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-23:</strong> It is a great phone and the Amazon price and delivery were fantastic.

I can clearly read the screen in broad daylight with no strain.- Processor is blazing fast. No lag with multiple apps open and switching between them.- size, shape, and weight are all perfect for me.  This phone is surprisingly thin.- speaker phone is loud and clear- cell phone reception and internet speed are exceptional- call clarity is excellent- GPS works MUCH better than the HTC inspire, and as good or better than the skyrocket- battery life is better than the HTC inspire, and about the same as the gs2 skyrocket (make sure to fully deplete the battery as soon as you get this phone.  Then give it a 100% charge without taking it off the charger.  Android OS needs to calibrate the battery.)- built in task manager works very well.- bottom app bar is customizable.- camera takes excellent pictures.- music player sounds great and is very responsive.- physical home button is nice to have- typing and playing games are both great experiences due to the huge, super responsive touch screen- Android 4.0.4 runs MUCH better on this device than it did on the galaxy S2 skyrocket- Shutter speed on the camera is very fast- I reliably(so-far) use the built-in clock/alarm app as my everyday wake-up alarm.  The smart alarm feature is really cool too!- Comes with headphones with in-line controls.  They are good for the gym, but the sound is a bit lean.CONS:- battery life still isn't as good as the iphone4.  This is primarily with regards to standby time.- Touchwiz doesn't seem to have as many pretty widgets as htc sense, but I've found some 3rd party replacements (extended controls, beautiful widgets, etc)- no more touch-search-button (only menu, back, and home buttons now).  I actually liked having that button.- phone is massive, so one-handed use is very difficult depending on what case you use.- S-voice is a joke, but you can use a different app...- Camera photo quality isn't quite up to par with apple's newer offerings, but is still very respectable.- Over a period of a few months, the samsung branded software keyboard will start to get VERY sluggish.  I recommend downloading the stock ICS or Jellybean keyboard from the Google Market!OTHER:- I recommend the "Llama" app to setup cell phone tower profiles.  When I enter my work's cell phone area, my phone automatically turns off wifi and gps, as well as mutes my phone.  When I leave work my phone automatically turns my volume back on.  When I get home I have it turn wifi on and gps off, and when I leave home it turns wifi off.  VERY useful and it saves battery life.Honestly, this is the best phone I've ever used.  Battery life may be a consideration for some people, but the micro USB charging port makes having (or borrowing) chargers pretty convenient. The size of the phone is awesome for me, but you may want something smaller.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00891PTQM" id="B00891PTQM-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-04:</strong> I went from a Samsung S2 to the iPhone thinking I was going up in quality.

I was skeptical at first about the Galaxy S3 because I was not sure how it would compare against the iPhone 5 but there's no competition because the Galaxy S3 wins hands down. I was blown away by this phone and I can't stop using it everywhere I go. It easily lasts a full day with a single charge and there's always around 20% left at the end of the day which is nice.Even my family who has been using an iPhone since they first came out is blown away by this phone. I have even caught them using my phone when they thought I was sleeping because they just love the big screen and the customization that it has compared to the iPhone 5. There are many reasons why I chose this phone over the iPhone 5 but the main reason is the screen size and the battery. It got to the point where the iPhone was too small for my hands and I'd have to charge it at least four times a day.These are some things that the Galaxy S3 has over the iPhone 5 and other high end phones:Pros:-Screen: The Galaxy S3 has a nice 4.8 inch Super AMOLED screen that makes everything stand out when you see it. The resolution on this phone is a nice 720 x 1280 which makes every look sharp. It has a significantly higher resolution than the iPhone 5(640 x 1136). Also, the iPhone 5 is only 4 inches which is way to small for most people.-Android OS: This phone now ships with Android 4.1.2 (Jelly Bean) which is the fastest Android version yet. The phone feels way faster than Android 4.0.4 (ICS) thanks to project butter which makes the CPU work at a high frequency as soon as you touch the screen to reduce lag and slow downs.-Design: I was getting tired of the same design with the iPhone and the Galaxy S3's design is sexy and very comfortable to hold in your hand. It has a nice feel to it that makes you want to hold it.-Camera: The camera on this phone is super awesome and takes some of the best pictures I have ever seen. Even the front facing camera is great when you are Skyping or even taking pictures of yourself.-Battery: The battery wasn't that good with Android 4.0.4 (ICS) but with the release of Android 4.1.2 (Jelly Bean), the phone lasts me now 2x as long as before. I can get through a day with a single charge and I can still have 20% left at the end of the day.-Storage: With the option of an external sdcard, this phone simply destroys the iPhone 5. I can store as many pictures and HD videos as I want and it will never be full. I am the type of person who stores large collections of pictures and videos and this phone lets me do all of that easily. I also play games that require a minimum of 1GB space.-Processor: The Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 does an amazing job at keeping this phone lag free and blazing fast. I have never experienced a slow down with this phone. I have even tested this phone by playing GTA Vice City that was just released on the highest settings and there was no slow downs whatsoever. I was very impressed.-Removable Battery: Who doesn't love this? I always carry extra batteries whenever I travel somewhere and I can easily swap my battery with another one when the phone is low on battery. This is a big plus for this phone.Cons:-S Voice: Doesn't really work most of the time for me. I have to constantly repeat the same thing so it hears it correctly.-Fingerprint magnet: While this may bother some, this can easily be fixed by buying a case.Overall it's a great phone and doesn't disappoint. With the amazing high resolution and screen size, this phone puts other phones to shame. The Galaxy S3 is the best phone of 2012.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00891PTQM" id="B00891PTQM-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-23:</strong> Just like the title says, ive never had a better phone.

I wasn't ready to live that much in the cloud.Thus far, the Galaxy S III has been the answer to all of my problems. It has none of the senility of my Galaxy I (which got really weird there at the end), it is far snappier than the Galaxy II I played with, and the Android 4.0 "Ice Cream Sandwich" OS has me giddy with its response time and smooth transition from one program to another. Yes, the Galaxy S III really can multi-task, and is happy to do so. Best of all, I slipped in my 32GB SD Card and we were ready to go. The HTC One X consumed just over 6GB of its built-in 16GB.  This means an AT&T; Evo One X has only 9 GB of room.  Out of the box, the Galaxy S III takes up a little over 4GB of the native 16, but will allow you to slot in an SD card of up to 64GB in size for even more room. If the battery stops holding a charge one day, I'll just open the case, pop it out, and put in a new one--how handy!I've seen some people have battery problems, but so far I've managed to go up to two days without having to charge.  It all depends on what I'm doing, but even with what I consider to be heavy activity (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, several calls, lots of surfing), I don't have to charge the phone more than once a day.INTERFACE AND SETTINGSWith the Galaxy S III's interface, there are a LOT of options that let you customize your phone to be just as you want it: it's as if the makers of both the Galaxy III and the Droid OS decided to bend over backwards and hand you the keys to pretty much every feature you can think of. For example, if you hate eating data when someone e-mails you an attachment, you can set the phone to only pull down attachments when on Wi-Fi, or not at all. Check for new messages anywhere from 'continuous' to 'daily' to 'never' (which means 'manually'). Hotmail works much better now that Exchange is supported--my Galaxy I would take forever, drop out, freeze, or give me nagging, 'Too many requests' messages.Getting around is smooth swiping with the Gorilla Glass on the Galaxy S III's face, but I still went with a so-so  Steinheil screen protector. Either way, SWYPEing is easier: not only is the onscreen keyboard huge, with the keys generously spaced wherever possible, but the SWYPE interface draws your swipe line cleanly and it is easy to see what word you are SWYPEing. Word suggest is still annoying--tap out the word "text" and get "Texas" inserted--but once I turned this off, everything else worked well. If there's one disadvantage to the Galaxy S III, it's that both the phone and the screen are a real fingerprint magnet: the Evo X picks up stains and smudges, but was just a bit better about not getting as much smeariness on the glass. Still, with either device the problem is solved by a quick swipe across your shirt.APPS AND WIDGETSAndroid phones now use the Google Play Store instead of the Droid Market and it works fairly well: enter your Google account info and you're ready to go. AT&T; customers still get CRapplications they can't remove, but your own third-party apps can also be side-loaded after changing one setting in the options. You can't root the phone (yet, anyway), but I'm not seeing the horrible performance drag of all that AT&T; stuff like I used to. I'm especially fond of the side-loaded Amazon App Store, which nimbly pushed all my apps down with no complaints, security warnings, or performance drops (take that, ol' Galaxy I!)Applications now come in two form factors: Apps and Widgets. When you tap the 'Applications' button from the home screen, the resulting screens are tabbed between a list of Applications and a list of Widgets. Think of an 'App' as meaning "An icon I tap to launch a program" and a 'Widget' as "A thing I may launch, or may just interact with at the screen and never need to open separately" (like the Weather, the media player, or the flashlight). When you swipe from one home screen to another, adding Widgets now gets a Windows Phone like twist: some widgets are double-wide like a Windows Phone 7 tile, and some (like the media player or the clock/weather on the main home screen) take up half the screen--the variety of sizes also resembles the coming Windows 8 Metro interface. Instead of feeling crowded, it reminds me of how much fun it was to play with my first desktop gadgets in Windows Vista.NETWORKING AND DATAWi-Fi and Bluetooth are very responsive: connecting to various networks or pairing is quick. If you connect to the type of network that requires you to open a browser and agree to something/provide a user ID before you can connect, the Galaxy S III will prompt you accordingly and automatically open the page you need. There is also a button right on the pull-down menu to turn off packet data so you can conserve your data plan--I like that feature VERY much.MULTIMEDIAMultimedia playback is excellent: while my Galaxy I would take quite a while to open and respond to me, the Media Player Widget makes my music quickly accessible. True to form, I get album art, artist/title/album searches, and a very good quality of playback over the included earbuds.CAMERAThe Galaxy S III has two cameras: one in the front and a much better one in the back. Both are for taking photos and shooting video. The camera on the back is for the serious picture-taking and has a very high-output flash for such a tiny LED. Picture-taking is so fast I find myself accidentally snapping multiple shots! The gallery of my Galaxy S I might take a while to show me newly-snapped photos, but with the S III they are not only instantly available, I can go straight into the Gallery from the Camera and not have to step out to the home screen. Flash can be adjusted on and off, switching cameras is as easy as tapping one icon, and there are a variety of easy-to-access options, from three focus modes (Auto, Macro, Face detection) to generic 'shooting mode' settings: Single shot, burst, HDR, "Smile Shot", Beauty, Panorama, Share Shot, and Buddy photo share. Settings includes the ability to adjust the exposure value, and what's more there are scene modes for sports, night, party/indoor, etc.CALLSThe feel of the Contacts and Phone Dialing interface haven't changed much, but the look certainly has: icons, contact pictures, and menus are larger on the Galaxy III's generous screen. I found myself making fewer mistakes trying to nudge and poke my way through the touchscreen when I needed to look up a contact or merge their information. Call quality is excellent, and answering the phone is easy. As with all new phones, there are many ringtones, alarms, and message sounds to choose from: I was very pleased with the variety of options this time around--the many sounds you can choose from for your calls range from soothing and tranquil to jarring and noisy.If you're looking for a new Android Smartphone, the Galaxy S III is a fantastic choice. Its screen is bright, colorful and generous, the OS runs smooth and fast and the screen is very responsive to touch. The number of features at times seems endless, but more importantly, Samsung have executed those features well: this is indeed a great phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00891PTQM', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00891PTQM', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B003U92PW4</h2>    <p class="price"> $B003U92PW4</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

I love it when you peel off a screen/otherwise protector and your device looks as if it just came out of the box, while you trash your gauged and scratched protector. A job well done right?I bought these protectors from my mom after I had installed the splash ones on her iPhone4 (verizon). She complained of a "rainbow effect" when light hit the screen. Sure enough, there were mixes of colors emanating from the surface screen (green, violet,blue). And not to mention, the splash cover's front protector kept scratching myyyy ear every time I talked on the phone.So knowing GT Max's line of apple accessories (bought a protective keyboard mat for my macbook) I have come to rely on them as far as protecting my cherished electronic devices. We bought the item for 82 cents? And maybe a dollar shipping and it came in the mail almost the next day! The covers were front and back protection for the iPhone4 (same as the splash ones) but at a fraction of the cost. There was no gooey residue or adhesive and they were easy to install.There are no glares, no oily screens, no rainbow effects, no orange-peel feeling... Just a smooth, form-fitting screen protector at a great price. That's what I like about this product. It's simple, It does what it says its made for, and its price is justified! Highly recommend getting these before buying a more expensive alternative.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003V555K6" id="B003V555K6-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-12:</strong> Such a good product.

The back is full of air pockets, despite careful application.Putting these on can be confusing. Just make sure you read the instructions and do it carefully.----All in all, it's worth it if you don't want a insanely priced missile proof screen protector.

The price was right so I gave them a try. I am quite pleased with my purchase. The item arrived quickly and in excellent condition, though in a humorously large box. Installation was simple and straightforward and the protector fits very well on my phone. The protector itself is nice and smooth with no sticky texture like some other brands I have tried in the past. There are three protectors in the package which is excellent, and it comes with a nice full-sized cleaning cloth. This is definitely a product I would buy again and that I would recommend.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FAC57EM" id="B00FAC57EM-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-29:</strong> Title says it all.

After comparing other products I decided to give this one a try despite only having one review at the time.  This was priced right, came with three protectors (I thought was great in case I screwed up the application, especially since I had two phones) and even had a lifetime guarantee (perfect should I mess up and ruin all three protectors).I did review the video's that ISmooth has on their website and I found these very helpful.  The process is pretty straight forward, but watching it done, including how to use the dust removal tool, made the installation very easy.  As long as you take your time and follow the instructions (straight forward and easy) the installation is pretty painless.  The install for my first phone took me about 5 minutes.  I took care to line up the product (as suggested in the video) and even though I took time to clean the screen (with the cloth included) I had a couple lint pieces on the screen that I had to remove.  The dust removal tool made this very easy.  What took the most time was I'd remove one piece of lint and then get another trapped.  Practice makes perfect and applying the protector on the next phone took under a couple minutes (only one piece of lint to remove).The fit of this screen protector is really nice.  It is also very smooth, by following the instructions there's not one bubble found and with my case on the phone I can't even tell there is a screen protector on it.  Additionally I can't tell the difference of the touch of the screen.  It's too early to tell how well the protector wears, but with the life guarantee this shouldn't be a problem as you can just get it replaced.  I'll update my review once I have used this for a month or two.I would not hesitate to recommend this product.** UPDATE - After using this for a couple of days it still looks great.  However I consider the design at the top of the screen protector to be slightly flawed.  It doesn't cover the entire screen at the very top, it has a cut-out around the flash, ear piece and lens instead of individual cut-outs for each.  The difference is when I swipe down from the top you feel the edge of the protector.  If each had it's own smaller cut out (like I've seen on several other protectors for this phone) you wouldn't feel the edge of the protector when you swiped, or it would be a lot less noticeable.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FAC57EM" id="B00FAC57EM-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-21:</strong> One of the few screen protectors I have found for the MotoX that did a good job of covering the edge to edge screen!  The film is good, to the point that I cannot tell it is there at all when the phone is on.  In addition, while this product is NOT an anti-glare screen protector, I did notice a reduction of the glare on the phone after it was installed.Installation was fairly easy, largely because the product includes dust removal stickers - and not just any old stickers - these have an actual tab to hold on to, which makes them much easier to use than other protectors that come with either nothing for dust removal or simply come with a portion of a sticker sheet cut down.My only criticism was that the plastic covering the protector on the install side was a little overly sticky.  When attempting to install screen protectors, I tend to peel the protective cover off as I apply the screen protector, so that dust doesn't have any time to get on the protector.  When doing that with these protectors, a slight residue was left behind.  That was easy enough to remove with the included microfiber cloth, but was awkward when it happened in the middle of the installation.  That said, the directions say to remove the protective cover from the film side entirely before applying - which would have avoided the problem.  I just like my method better, through years of experience with devices and screen protectors.Definitely a 5 star product!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FAC57EM" id="B00FAC57EM-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-03:</strong> Best screen protector that I have used for the Moto X.

Not the Razr), and decided to get a screen protector.  I'm not sure why I want one, as my last Droid Razr M had Gorilla Glass and I beat the tar out of it with very few scratches, but I just did.  I've tried lots of the cheap screen protectors, but am generally disappointed with how they make the image grainy, and quickly peel them off and toss them.  This iSmooth protector is the real deal.  Once on the phone, I saw ZERO difference in image quality.  It is also simple to install.This company is top notch with customer service.  They have multiple videos on how to install the protector, give you three of them in case you mess up, and have countless options of how to contact them if you have any problems.  There is no question these guys at iSmooth care about building a business.As for the install, I was almost intimidated because of all the detailed instructions, thinking it must be tricky.  It's not.  At all.  Took me about 5 minutes max, and that includes finding 4 or 5 lint bubbles.There are not many products in competitive categories I would call a "no-brainer", but this is one.UPDATE June 23, 2014.  I just looked at this review and realize I STILL have the original protector on my phone, and it still looks great. That's 7 months with the same one.  Pretty amazing.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FAC57EM" id="B00FAC57EM-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-09:</strong> Crystal clear phone screen protector, works very well on my new phone.I would gladly buy this again if I broke my phone, or something happened to it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FAC57EM" id="B00FAC57EM-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-11:</strong> The iSmooth screen protector is a high quality product for a very affordable price.

It's a good thing the package comes with three protectors because it will take three trys to get it right.  That's not necessarily a bad reflection on the manufacturer, they're all buggers to put on.  I knocked off points for fit, primarily where, again, a lot of manufacturers fall short:  the top where the camera and proximity and light sensors live.  This protector misses by maybe a hair.  The cut at the top needs to be maybe 1/16th of an inch bigger.  Maybe even less.  Regardless, the proximity sensor will over-react even if the film is barely on the edge.  So the product is good but needs a little fine tune on the indent at the top.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FAC57EM" id="B00FAC57EM-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-05:</strong> iSmooth is now my go to screen protector brand.

No contract. Full price. That said, every phone we own doesn't leave our house without a case and a screen protector. I've spent as much as $35 on a screen protector, but, let's be honest. I don't care how much you spend or whether or not they make it out of the same stuff they coat the space shuttle with or what. After 6 months, all screen protectors look like garbage. That's why, I've started looking for protectors that offer the most realistic "glass" feel instead of buying based on how long I'll have it. I bought the iSmooth protectors for my Nexus 5 and honestly my wife asked me, about 2 weeks after I had them, if I was ever going to put a screen protector on my phone. I told her I already did. She looked really close and was like "WOW. That feels just like the glass screen". I just finished putting them on her new Moto X and it's the same thing. Fits perfectly and offers a "glass-like" feel. The fact that they give you 3 means you can use it till it gets scuffed up, then put on a new one. Best screen protectors... period. Not even "for the money". Just best screen protectors all around.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FAC57EM" id="B00FAC57EM-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-20:</strong> Disappointed with this product.

At max it wasn't enough to get immersed into the music, and I'm not even the kind of person to blast it to the max normally, there just isn't enough volume there. To me they go up to what other normal headphones probably put out at about 50% volume. On my phone and tablet I used an application to boost the sound and it helped but its an inconvenience but it still wasn't all there, maybe up to 70%.2) Volume aside, the quality of the sound was OK, but don't expect a nice bass out of them by any means.3) For some reason they disconnect sometimes by themselves, or the music stops and I have to disconnect the Bluetooth myself to get it to play again. I ruled out my playing device as being at fault since this doesn't happen with a different Bluetooth receiver product that I have. (Same way I can narrow down the volume problem to these headphones)4) I knew the charger was proprietary before I ordered, which was at that time the point I disliked the most of these headphones, but whatever I still went for them based on other descriptions... The charger broke just a couple of days after I got them, now what?? Without any harsh type of use whatsoever. Cant use the headphones anymore.5) The description said that I could connect to 2 devices at the same time but I was never able to do this though I tried with 2 devices to which I could easily connect independently. Tried turning off the 'phone' connection on the tablet and then attempting the second connection with my phone but nothing.6) They never actually fell out but the fit doesn't feel so secure, probably could have had better sound quality with a better fit though I'm not sure by how much. If I barely touch them they do disengage enough to deteriorate the sound quality. Tried different bud sizes and the stabilizers.7) And I didn't get to test this enough to be sure but I think people have a hard time hearing me through the mic on calls.Sounds like a scathing review but I had to put my experience out there.** UPDATE ************************************************************As noted by others, their customer service is extraordinary, and they sprung to action to make things alright for me. Literally its the best of any brand I've known. I would try again their products sometime in the future regardless of what happened to me with this one item. I do think that they will work to come up with improvements to their products and wish them luck with that.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EYUJ1ZC" id="B00EYUJ1ZC-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-06:</strong> I'm the happy owner of a half-dozen or so Anker products. Their customer service is the best. I desperately wanted to love these earbuds, but the problems I had with them were enough to cause me to return them. The sound quality is okay. The battery life is fantastic. The fact that they're Bluetooth LE compatible is awesome. However, the cons include:* Occasionally the audio would drop out for a second, even when my phone was just a couple of feet away.* The volume is too low. Inside a quiet room it was fine, but when I stepped outside or inside a restaurant, I'd have to crank up volume on the phone and the earbuds all the way up, and it still wasn't what I'd call loud.* It only came with a cable, not a wall plug. That meant that I'd have to swap out the cable for one of my existing USB wall plugs or buy another one.* The charging cable is too short (about 1.5 feet).* The charging cable uses a proprietary clip to attach to the earbuds. That means that if the cable gets damaged or lost, I'd have no way of charging the earbuds. It also means that I'd have to carry the charging cable everywhere with me, for those moments when the batteries suddenly die. I wish the earbuds simply accepted a standard microUSB plug; I have a bunch of those laying around all over the house, office, and car.* The buds didn't stay in my ears, even with the flat rubber "wings" that came with them. The right bud, particularly, would come loose. I'd have to keep pushing them back into my ear.* Player controls weren't intuitive to operate. Tapping the "+" and "-" buttons work as you'd expect to control volume. However, to rewind audio you have to long-press the "+" button, and to fast-forward the audio you long-press the "-" button. Those should be reversed.I hope they go back to the drawing board on this one, because it's got good potential. If they simply added a microUSB port, I wouldn't mind it if they got rid of the charging cable altogether.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EYUJ1ZC" id="B00EYUJ1ZC-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-22:</strong> Big disappointment in microphone quality.

Their batteries are solid and a great value and the USB hub is very fast and charges even high demand tablets.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EYUJ1ZC" id="B00EYUJ1ZC-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-13:</strong> After reading some positive reviews, I decided to get these. I had the LG Tone+ before, and those just didn't last. So, I thought these would be better and last longer than 6 months. But they didn't even last a whole day! First off, the review by Anker's Power User Program(Anker sends users a product to be reviewed), they are totally misleading. I was sold by a video review from a Power User. The review stated,&#34;The headset are lightweight and you'll barely know you're wearing them.&#34; Wrong, they are heavy especially the left side.The range of the headset are terrible! When my LG Tone+ were working right, I could leave my phone in my room and walk across the house w/ music playing and NOT lose a connection. W/ the Anker Bluetooth, I can't even walk down the hall w/out the music cutting in and out. It's even worst if you're a runner or want to use these w/ an arm band. I decided to return these after I went out for a run. Another review had this same exact problem. I wear my armband on my left arm and the music kept cutting in and out. My phone is less than 2 feet away from the bluetooth and it's losing connection? So, I switched arms and it sort of solved it. It also cuts in and out if you try to use the controls to change it to the next track. I don't know why it does that. But it just made me more angry. So, after finishing my run and I put them back the box and schedule for a UPS Pick up to get them out of my house. I never been so frustrated w/ a product. I also read from a reviewer that Anker connected them and he received another pair w/ the same issue. Honestly, I don't want another pair. I just want a decent pair of Bluetooth headphones so I don't have to get tangled w/ my headphone wire on my run. Some people like them, but for me, I really want to give it 0 stars.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EYUJ1ZC" id="B00EYUJ1ZC-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-09:</strong> In my estimation this is a breakthrough product category and one of those things that is a "must have". Why you may ask, since there are headphones, earphones, ear buds and other listening devices of nearly every size, shape, price and function.Because these are the first I would call "Stuffables". Unlike virtually every wired and wireless headphone made, these are the first to be rugged enough to pull out of your ears and just throw into your pocket or purse along with your keys, pocket change and anything else. Unlike other earbuds that use frail thin wires that tangle if you look cross-eyed at them, the Anker buds use a thick flat rubber cable that looks like it would survive a ride in the washing machine (DON'T try it), and no matter what I do I can't get them to tangle.There is precious little excess in these buds ... two slightly large earpieces, a short (thank you!) cable that hangs under or behind your neck with an extremely slender control pod. Hidden somewhere is a microphone with noise-reduction that's reasonably close to your mouth. Charging is done with a small clip-on plug that is equally light and portable for mobile use. And not to stop there, Anker has thoughtfully supplied additional tabs that virtually "glue" the earbuds to your ears for sports like bike riding, jogging, etc.Why are these "must have"? Consider the ways I have found to use them. Seriously it's a wonder they ever leave my ears:1. They are so small, easy to use and convenient I now use them to listen to virtually everything on my smartphone rather than through the tinny speaker, with the added bonus they are ready instantaneously to use as a talk/listen headset that tremendously helps block out external noise and make talking on my phone a joy, even in noisy airports.2. As good as the internal speakers are getting in tablets/eReaders these simply sound better and are the most perfect earbuds I have ever found for watching a movie on an airplane.3. When I am at my desk I now use them to listen to the audio from my desktop and my laptop the vast majority of time, but especially at night when I want to crank it up without disturbing those around me.4. Ditto for watching TV. A simple Bluetooth adapter on my home entertainment amp actually allows me to listen to any source while walking around, feeding the pets, watering the lawn, you get the idea. I can even follow the game on TV from the back yard by looking through the window at the TV from time to time during a big play. It's important to note for a use like this that Anker allows simultaneous connection with two devices to play music on one device and take a call on the other.5. While I don't use an iPod as much anymore because all that's built in to my phone and tablet, there is a tiny Bluetooth adapter for that too, where I can toss the player in my pocket and listen wire-free.Let me repeat the word "toss". There is no stereo headset I have ever seen that is so easy to simply shut off and stuff into my pocket (hence, Stuffable). When the flight attendant is giving me the evil eye to shut off ALL devices, no longer do I have to carefully stow away a pair of headphones, I just stuff the Ankers into my jeans, ready to go the instant the warden gives me the green light.They are comfortable. Battery life is reasonable at about 7 hours and they are rugged. They sound great. Bass is deeper than the average earbuds, high-end is tight and the mid-range (important for dialogue in movies and for cell phone talk) is clear. Unlike some other earbuds I've tried which have to be adjusted perfectly to get the "sweet spot", these are not as picky about exact placement in your ears. I also like that there are NO operating buttons on the earbuds themselves so there is zero risk of mistakenly hanging up or doing something you don't want to while adjusting the buds in your ears.Bottom line ... I got these direct from the manufacturer to provide evaluation and feedback. That had no influence on this or any review I write. Be aware that success with Bluetooth products is not always the same for everyone. I've had a higher-than-usual interest in Bluetooth technology for a long time (which is one reason I tested these) and have had my share of disappointments. Bluetooth gets better all the time and I don't doubt that these earbuds represent some of the most current technology available.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EYUJ1ZC" id="B00EYUJ1ZC-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-12:</strong> Excellent Bluetooth earbuds.

That said, I am really happy with it, with only a few minor pain points (later). I am using this with both my iPod nano and my HTC One.Comfort: Very light, good cable length, and comfortable ear pillows (several are included, and some of the comply foam tips are also compatible).Audio quality: The bluetooth audio is outstanding - quality is about as good as a pair of Shure E3cs. This is probably helped by the apt-X audio codec support.Construction: cables seem reasonably thick and there's good strain relief.Support: Every time I have ever had a problem with an Anker product, the support folks there have always bent over backwards to assist.OK, here's why I knocked off a star:Control: there is a builtin inline control pod with up/down and multifuntion switch. There are symbols build in to the rubber coating, but it can be hard to get to them quickly. Perhaps long use would help?Voice quality: Given that there is nothing in the way of a mic that visible, much less particularly close to your mouth, it is almost surprising to realize that these can be used to speak. Anyway, the speech quality is not great (according to the people I called) and there's even a small echo. Still, when the main thing is to sit and listen to tunes on the phone, the ability to answer calls without scrambling is great and, for that kind of casual use it's fine. If you want perfect clarity, get a wired headset or at least something like a Plantronics Voyager.Charging: It's kind of annoying that this comes with a proprietary charging cable. You cannot use a regular microusb charger for this. Instead, you get something like a vampire clamp that you have to get on just right -- and you have to make sure to have it around. I hate having extra cables.In summary: This is a great device if you have a bluetooth audio device like a new iPod Nano or smartphone. I would certainly recommend it, though I would suggest you be careful not to lose the charging cable.  Also, be careful with the earbud covers - they have a tendency to pop off.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00EYUJ1ZC', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00EYUJ1ZC', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00AZ4KG64</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00AZ4KG64</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

Someone has done the obvious thing and created a nearly invisible protective case for the iPhone. This isn't like any case I've seen yet and I've seen a lot of them. This slips on easily, protects completely, the holes line up perfectly but you don't see it! All you see is your beautiful iPhone. And it's thin!I wonder why no one that I've seen has done this before. I was so tired of thick rubbery cases that not only hide the beauty of my phone but make it much thicker. I don't care how nice the color is or how well they fit, they wreck the esthetics of my iPhone.This has the little protective lip that hooks around the edge. It comes in a perfectly clear plastic box. You see right through the package immediately, to emphasize that this is see through. As far as hand feel goes, it is a cross between rubbery and hard plastic. It's the best of both worlds and gives just a small amount of gripiness while feeling as if it will be scratch resistant.Did I say it's thin? It adds the smallest amount of thickness I've seen yet. This is the no case case. It is as close as you're going to get to going caseless. This is one of my rare ten star products.Thank you Ailet for providing me with a free sample!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IA8Z4R8" id="B00IA8Z4R8-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-27:</strong> The Ailet clear and flexible case for the iPhone 5 and 5s is perfect for those who need a little protection, desire a simple case, and want to be able to see and appreciate the iPhone&#8217;s clean design.The case is very easy to install and remove.  It simply stretches over the phone and falls into place.  It has a secure fit without being too tight.The bezel that runs around the front of the case is very slim and does not interfere with the screen or the home button.  There are cut outs on the case&#8217;s bottom to accommodate the iPhone&#8217;s ports, speaker, and microphone.  Another cut out is on the side for the mute switch, with one on the back that accommodates the camera and flash.  The lock button and the volume buttons have covers molded into the case that do not interfere with the buttons&#8217; operation.In use the case adds decent grip to the iPhone with it&#8217;s rubber construction and offers moderate protection.  This is not a case for someone who will be giving the iPhone to a young child to play with, or someone who tends to drop their iPhone a lot.  It works best for those who are careful with their phones but want some protection from the wear and tear of daily life and the occasional fall.  A little bit of dust works its way under the case with use, but the case has not discolored or cracked in any way.All in all&#8230; the perfect case for those who like to keep it simple.(I received a complimentary sample of this product from the manufacturer in exchange for an unbiased review.)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IA8Z4R8" id="B00IA8Z4R8-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-19:</strong> This is a simple soft plastic case that has been manufactured to the precise dimensions of the Apple iPhone 5/5S. The plastic is flexible enough so that it is easy to slide the phone into it and once inside the case looks like it was part of the original package. Since the plastic is soft, it is hard to scratch or chip, keeping it transparent longer than harder plastic cases that don't have comparable give. It also wipes off very easily. There are also notches and cutouts for access to data ports and the charger.A simple item that can help protect your phone without changing the fundamental aesthetics, this case is inexpensive insurance to protect your iPhone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IA8Z4R8" id="B00IA8Z4R8-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-23:</strong> This review is from: Ailet Minimalist Slim Crystal Clear Iphone5/5s Flexible Soft Case- Lightweight- [Transparent] - [Retail Box] - [Fits All Carriers] (Wireless Phone Accessory)This review is from: AILET Minimalist Original Crystal Clear iPhone5/5S Flexible Soft Case - Transparent - Retail Box (Wireless Phone Accessory)I recommend this minimalist iPhone 5 case for the reasons below.

I have other iPhone 5 cases yet use this one because of its practical design.* Tiny added weight yields outsized protection of phone because of the shock absorbent material and reinforced corners.* Clearness of case lets one forget it's there. Shows the minimalistic Apple design, something I associate with good feelings.* I believe it's useful to have a few iPhone cases including a minimalistic one like this, a battery case that while making one's phone bulkier allows twice the usage before recharging, and a colorful one that personalizes the iPhone.* Clear cases can over time show dust and/or small abrasions. It helps to take the case off occasionally to clean it.* Side note: This case is from AILET.

Because of its beautiful design I hate putting it inside of a protective case. Over the years I've gone back and forth with using cases for the iPhones I've owned. In my first hand experience iPhone is much better at withstanding scratches, bumps and impacts than the much cheaper quality Android phones, but it's still not immune to them.AILET minimalist transparent case is probably as close as you'll ever get to an iPhone case that still allows for the beauty of the phone to be seen. It's very simply designed, fits snuggly on your iPhone, and leaves total access to all of iPhone's ports and buttons. The case was easy to install. TPU is a soft material that is reasonably nice to touch, but it will make your iPhone feel more plasticky than its elegant metal and glass exterior.One problem that I have with a transparent case, which may not be much of an issue initially, is that all smartphone cases, no matter how snug they may seem, eventually manage to trap some dirt and dust. This will probably mean that you'll have to open up this case every once in a while (perhaps once every one to two months) and wipe the phone and the case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IA8Z4R8" id="B00IA8Z4R8-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-25:</strong> My wife and I have been fighting over this ever since I received it.

I&#8217;ve always been a pretty tough customer when it comes to protection for my iPhone.  I&#8217;ve always been OCD when it comes to protecting my expensive too often used iOS device.  That is why I&#8217;m a diehard Otterbox fan and nothing is going to change that.So why did I want to try out this case?  I thought this would be a case that I would take out for a night on the town when I don&#8217;t want to have a bulky thing in my pocket.  (That sounds so first world huh?)  And I was right.  This is a very nice case&#8230; as long as you aren&#8217;t looking for a ton of protection.  The fit is snug and the material feels nice in your hands.  Very nice actually.  The buttons are accessible and easy to manipulate.But as I was testing this case out and going about my day to day business, I found myself being a little too careful because I didn&#8217;t have the protection that I normally did.  No fault of the manufacturer, but I would not use this as my everyday case.  Like I said earlier, I would use this case when I go on a date with my wife, an evening book signing, or another classy outing.  It&#8217;s a very simple yet very stylish case that gives your iPhone a good look with minimal protection.If you like to have your iPhone shine with very covering then I think you will like this case.  If you protect your iPhone like you protect your children&#8230; wait that sounds bad.  If you protect your iPhone like you protect your footsie-wootsies in a rain storm, then this would make a good second case, but not your primary.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IA8Z4R8" id="B00IA8Z4R8-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-24:</strong> Between my wife and I, we've had 5 different iPhones with a variety of cases over the years. The AILET Crystal Clear Soft Case for the iPhone 5/5S is a nice bumper case so long as you don't have a screen protector on the phone. If you use a screen protector I don't recommend this case since it pushes against the edges of the screen protector causing sides to bubble up. It's the first time my wife or I have had this problem with a case.PROS:1. The AILET provides a good balance between thickness and protection. It's thick enough to protect the iPhone if dropped or knocked but thin enough that the phone still retains its sleek design. The AILET case replaced a Spigen Saturn case my wife was previously using on her 5S. While the Saturn case is ultra thin it doesn't provide protection outside of scuffs and scratches. Within a couple weeks of using the Saturn case, her iPhone was dinged and dented in a couple of areas. The AILET provides much better protection than the Saturn case.2. Minimalist design. Except for AILET's logo on the side, the case is completely transparent with no tinting or additional designs. I like the simple design better than the Amazon Basic cases we've used in the past which have geometric designs on the back. The iPhone fits firmly inside the case. The case has a nice feel with its smooth back and beveled sides.CONS:1. Pushes against edges of the screen protector causing sides of screen protector to completely bubble up. AILET case should either wrap around more so it overlaps the screen protector or less so there is a small gap between the screen protector and the case. As it is, the case is flush with the screen protector. After using the case for about 6 weeks, 3 of the 4 sides of the screen protector were completely bubbled up. It's a very big problem.2. Headphones need to have a slim jack to be able to plug into the phone with the bumper case on. This is pretty common but still worth noting. While my earbud headphones have no problem plugging into the iPhone, my Audio Technica M50 headphones are not able to plug into the iPhone with the AILET case on.SUMMARY:The AILET is a simply designed bumper case that provides a good balance between thickness and protection but I don't recommend this case if you use a screen protector. My wife had the same screen protector on her 5s when using the Saturn case and didn't have an issue with it pushing up the edges of the screen protector. I have the same make/model screen protector on my iPhone 5c with an i-Blason case and don't have an issue either. With the Saturn and i-Blason case I can see a small gap between the case and screen protector which isn't there with the AILET. Sadly, we are going to have to buy another case for the 5s and install another screen protector.Note: A product sample was provided by the seller in exchange for a fair, unbiased review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IA8Z4R8" id="B00IA8Z4R8-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-14:</strong> This is a beautiful clear case for the iPhone 5.

ALL buttons and lenses are useable and unencumbered - the iPhone sits snugly inside. The transparency is so clear you almost can't notice it's in a case. In one sense, this is primarily a protective cover only. But, it also shows off your iPhone5, if you're into that sort of thing. It doesn't obscure the logo or anything else.One nice unadvertised "feature" is the ability to print and cut your own graphic or photo and insert inside the back part of the cover. You can probably do this with any cover where the back is transparent, but I'm quite proud of my Krusty the Clown customization. I used a hobby knife to cut out a space in the paper of my printed graphics in order to also display the Apple logo. I've had several people ask me, "where did you get that mod?"Though not an incredible product, this gets 5 out of 5 stars for being EXACTLY what it says it is, and for being machined nicely so that I have no complaints.Note: I received a sample of this product for review purposes. I'm pleased enough with this case to continue using it as a preferred accessory for my iPhone5.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IA8Z4R8" id="B00IA8Z4R8-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-28:</strong> I've been enjoying my new iPhone 5S for a few months, and I've been trying out different cases, trying to find the &#34;right&#34; one.  When i was offered a sample to try out and review, I jumped at the opportunity.This case is extremely lightweight, with flexible sides that make inserting the phone easy.  It fits snugly, but all controls are where they should be and easily accessible.  Best of all, it lets the sleek beauty of the iPhone 5S shine through.Yes, I'll probably use other cases occasionally, but this is my new &#34;everyday&#34; case.

Of course, all the openings are in exactly the right spot for use and charging.The material is completely transparent and will take a permanent marker for do-it-yourself graphics, if desired.A case was provided for testing and evaluation.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IA8Z4R8" id="B00IA8Z4R8-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-12:</strong> AILET was kind enough to send me a case for review.The first impression was that the case fits so snugly and perfectly on the iPhone that it feels as though it should have been part of the base design.  Because of its transparency, it allows the basic appearance of the iPhone to shine through without dulling or making it look &#34;ugly&#34; as some other cases tend to do.  It feels like a more durable version of the bumper that Apple used to give away due to &#34;Antennagate&#34;.There are cover-style pieces for the buttons, including the power and volume buttons, and a cutout for the speakers and charging port on the bottom.  The speaker cutout was not perfectly aligned with the speaker holes, but the charging hole was lined up nicely.At first, pressing the power button seemed to be a bit more challenging because it forces you to press the button squarely in the middle.  Most long-term iPhone users are accustomed to being able to press either side of the button to get it turn on; it's easy to press so you can quickly get to what you need.  The power button cover on the AILET case does not allow for this, and it takes some getting used to.  In some ways this is a positive design: it prevents you from accidentally pressing the button when you didn't intend to, powering on the screen and draining the battery unnecessarily.There were two nitpicks observed.  First, the edge of the case where it was apparently sealed feels sharp to the touch; not to the point of cutting, but it's apparent when holding the device for calls.  If you're a leftie, it's a plus: it helps you hold the phone as it rests comfortably in your thumb.  If you're a rightie, it'll be slightly annoying as it will rest in your finger joint and possibly get uncomfortable after a lengthy phone call.Second was that the phone is not matte or patterned, which means it was prone to slipping out of the hand slightly easier than the phone without the case.  Again, if you're a leftie, this likely won't be an issue.If you're trying to get something that protects the edges of your device and is raised enough to help protect the front and back of an otherwise fragile device, BUT is not unattractive and retains the appearance of the iPhone, consider this case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IA8Z4R8" id="B00IA8Z4R8-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-12:</strong> This may be minimalist, but it's not minimal. For one thing the claim of precise fit is valid. It may seem like an easy thing to accomplish, but judging from other cases that I have tested and reviewed for the iPhone 5S it apparently isn't.The fit of this case, including access to buttons, ports and features is perfect. What I love is the case, which is made from thermoplastic polyurethane and does, indeed, absorb shocks. In fact I wish I could find such a case for my Galaxy Note 3 phone.As for the claim that this is 'crystal clear' all I can say is it's so transparent that it does not look like you have a case protecting your phone. The advantage is not just the look, but the fact that this case does not appreciably add to the size of your phone, and the weight difference is nominal.One final thing that I love about this case is the lip that goes around it us slightly curved inward. It's slightly raised above the screen, so your phone may survive a fall on a flat surface.If there is a single improvement that I would like to see it's a slightly enlarged cutout for the charging cable. This perfectly fits Apple's OEM cable, but there are some aftermarket cables that are a tad too large to properly seat. Of course, that is the fault of the cable manufacturer and not this case, which is perfect for genuine Apple parts.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IA8Z4R8" id="B00IA8Z4R8-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-01:</strong> This case is very sturdy and fits snug on my phone, as it will not pop off.

The AILET Minimalist Original Crystal Clear iPhone 5/5S Soft Transparent Case is a lightweight (.7 ounce), not-waterproof, flexible, transparent case for the iPhone 5 which protects the sides, corners, and back of the phone from incidental contact, with a recessed front that keeps the face of the iPhone5/5S from touching the surface if the front of the iPhone is face down. The transparency allows the colors of the instrument to be seen. All ports, controls, front and back cameras, and speakers are uncovered and accessible. The volume up and down controls are covered by plastic buttons, and respond perfectly when pushed. The plastic is sturdy and fits the iPhone5/5S with no gaps. When I tested the strength by repeatedly  taking the empty case and pushing the sides together until they touched, top-to-bottom and side-to-side, the case springs back into its original shape.  If an air pocket develops when 'popping' the iPhone into the case, it can be pushed out easily. Only a protective face cover would have made this a perfect, non-charging, all-over iPhone 5/5S cover. This 'pop in, pop out' AILET transparent, plastic, iPhone protective case is attractive, functional, and Highly Recommended! Four and a half SLEEK Stars! (60 day "no questions asked" warranty.

I usually turn such offers down, but I was actually looking for a light, unobtrusive iPhone 5 case, so here we are. This is a nice case! It adds very little bulk to your iPhone 5 (letting you enjoy the small size of the phone) but protects the back and sides. It also provides a lip for the front so that if you invert your iPhone 5 on a desk or some other surface the screen is protected from scratching. This case is designed to protect your iPhone from everyday use; it is not going to protect it from water or the elements the way more bulky cases may do.  The thing I like about this case is that it allows the nifty look of the iPhone to be on display, and it allows me to slip the iPhone 5 into my jacket pocket without bulking the phone up and without a grabby rubbery surface.  Use this case in conjunction with one of those stick-on screen protectors and you will have a nice little setup for your iPhone. By the way every charger I've tried works with this case; you do not have to remove the case as is so with some chargers. Recommended.

I prefer a light weight case, but often the ones that look crystal/jelly like this have a sticky/tacky feeling to them that makes them extremely difficult to get in/out of the pocket. This one does not have that problem.It is not sticky, yet is still compliant/pliable enough that it will absorb some of the shock if you drop the phone. It's more precisely fit and easier to install/remove than any other case I've used.The holes for headphone & charging are big enough to work well, and accommodates third part cables like Amazon brand charging cables which have proven to be an issue for some people.Fully recommended and no issues/problems with this case.By a lot of hard hours and days and years of time spent reviewing, I found myself in the top 10 reviewers on Amazon. This wasn't a goal or self promotion, but by nose-down focused reviewing.

My daughter's is gold, and with a traditional case, all that showed of it was the gold ring around the buttons. If you pay for a nice looking phone and want people to see it, this is the case for you.The case is well made and does a good job protecting the phone. The material is flexible enough that it doesn't interfere with pressing buttons at all. The sides are slightly thinner than other cases I have. All similar cases will allow a certain amount of movement if you touch the side portions near the screen, and this allows slightly more. That's neither a positive nor a negative per se, and has nothing to do with the quality of the case. But it did mean that I had to remedy a badly aligned screen protector. The overall thickness is perfect, and will keep the phone from sliding away.The bottom of the case has less open space than some others I have, offering slightly more protection, but potentially less compatibility. This case works fine with standard accessories such as authorized iPhone cables. There are some docking stations that won't work with any case, and this is no exception. But there are some accessories that are in between, such as aftermarket cables. This all boils down to other components not being compatible with Apple specs rather than the case being at fault, but it's something to keep in mind when you buy other accessories. Genuine ones work best.  The AmazonBasics lightning compatible cable's description gives a warning that it might not be compatible with certain cases, and with this one you have to be extra careful to get it to make contact, but you won't have to remove this case to do so. I used it with aZeetron Light Up Lightning USB Cableand had to be extra careful to get things to seat, but the affect was amazing. Since the cable tip lights up, the case transmitted the light much the way a fiber optic cable does, and gave a pleasant red glow while the the phone was charging, which switched to a turquoise glow when the phone was charged. Other people in my daughter's dorm thought that made the case the coolest thing ever.What was more surprising is the reaction it got. I didn't expect that a clear minimalist case would garner many comments, but it proved to be very popular. That was especially true among male college students.Note: I was sent a sample of this case, but no review was promised in exchange. Opinions are my own, but were influenced by the positive reaction this case got from others.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00IA8Z4R8', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00IA8Z4R8', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B008I6X7DU</h2>    <p class="price"> $B008I6X7DU</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

The price is really what won me over.Pros:--------Feels legit, meaning that this doesn't feel like a hard film, but a sliver of glass.-For someone who has oily disgusting fingers no matter how hard I try to wash and dry them out, this screen lives up to its oleophobic claims- The thickness is great, its just barely thicker than a normal PET screen protector. When on the home button becomes nearly (if not) flush with the glass. Which I kind of really like, since I know where the home button is that I don't need that tactile reminder.-This doesn't mess with tight form fitting cases thanks to the glass's absurd thinness-It feels like the screen is more sensitive with this protector on over my PET film.-When ON the screen looks gorgeous, better than with the protector off-Rather easy install, nothing got trapped under the glass while applying it which was a miracle in itselfCons:---------There is some heavy rainbowing going on when the screen is OFF-The glass is kind of on the small side, which might be so that it works with different tight cases, but not too small and the cut outs are perfect.

I thought it was awfully expensive for a screen protector but have changed my mind considerably now that I have it.  I purchased this brand because of the reviews and it doesn't disappoint!  the box alone was probably half the cost because it gave quite a presentation with a hint of the quality inside.  The protector itself was a bit thicker than I expected.For installation you do have to make sure you are in a dust free environment and clean the screen carefully.  Handle the screen by the sides so as not to get oil/dirt from your fingertips on the adhesive side.  It is much easier to line up than the flimsy plastic screen protectors.  I was able to just line it up with the home screen button and drop it down.  Getting rid of the &#34;bubbles&#34; just takes a few minutes of slow, even pressure as you push it to the sides.  At first I was worried about the smaller looking bubbles but within an hour it completely evened out and disappeared.  The surface is slick and even and the touch screen is perfectly responsive.  I do find the fingerprint scan is a little more difficult but I think with a few scans I'll get the feel of it.I like it, a lot.  The wear and tear will determine if I continue to like.  If I run into any issues I'll update my review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00J9XPJQE', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00J9XPJQE', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00JLQU9DC</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00JLQU9DC</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

I sometimes use a battery case for my Iphone and since it uses the mini USB it works great with this - or I just leave my Iphone naked and plug on in. The cord is pretty short - but worked fine in my car where I find the most need for it. I run and do races and so sometimes, when I'm on a trail race and I've used my phone for apps and for keeping track of me with GPS the battery runs down quickly. This thing is super convenient to have and lets me charge up right there in the care with my USB port. So far it's been tossed about on my keychain for a little while and is pretty sturdy. I gave 4 stars because I'm a tad bit worried about longevity with the hippo's mouth not shutting all the way - and my stuff goes through a lot of dirt being on trails so much. So far though, as indicated, all good and so much character :)Disclaimer: I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JLQU9DC" id="B00JLQU9DC-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-22:</strong> If you have ever been caught without a USB charging cable for your iPhone, you will appreciate this little gizmo. It will never be your everyday cable, but in a pinch, it might come in very handy.=== The Good Stuff ===* It is small. It its &#34;stored&#34; configuration, it is 1 7/8&#34; x 1 1/8&#34; x 3/16&#34;. Easily small enough to keep on a keychain, and it has a hole cut in for just this purpose. It weighs 0.2 ounces, barely enough to notice. When extended, the cord is roughly 4&#34; long, just enough to connect between a USB port and an iPhone.* The connector fit well into the iPhone 30 pin connector and a USB port, providing a snug fit both times. It seemed to charge in the &#34;normal&#34; amount of time. I was unable to sync my iPhone using this cable- the rear panel of the package says it will &#34;charge&#34;, so that may be expected behavior.=== The Not-So-Good Stuff ===* The plastic of this in 3/8&#34; thick, which means that it is a big of a struggle to get on and off a keychain. The cord is so short that using it while attached to my car keys was problematic. The struggle to get this on and off a keychain ruined some of the convenience, although that could be solved with some sort of easy-separate keychain- something like people use for a valet key.* When putting the cord back into the case, you have to remember to put the USB connector in first, otherwise it won't go together. it resulted in a few choice words until I remembered the secret.=== Summary ===* While it may not be the 100% most convenient design, if you need one of these cables in a pinch, this isn't a bad thing to have on hand. Rather than my keychain, I ended up putting it on a loop of string inside my computer bag, attaching it to one of the many metal loops. While I won't use it everyday, I am sure someday it will prove itself very useful, especially considering the small weight and size penalty for carrying it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JLQU9DC" id="B00JLQU9DC-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-07:</strong> This is a good idea for people who often find themselves needing a short charging cable for micro USB or Apple Lightening devices. I tried it with my iPad mini and Android smartphone and it worked fine with both, though one issue you may run into is difficulty plugging it into devices that have large cases that interfere with the plug.The variety of colors this is available in is also a plus, and the material feels durable and of good quality.I do wish they provided some instructions and illustrations with it, but it's not too hard to figure out how to get the cable out and use it. When done charging, put (by pushing) both connectors back in the hippo for protection and to hide them (pulling on the keyring may be helpful as well).You probably wouldn't want to use this as your regular charging cable, but it's a great idea for anyone who often wants or needs a charging cable and finds that they don't have one immediately available... so for that reason I am rating it 4 stars (but if this doesn't apply to you (i.e. you hardly ever find yourself in need of such cabling), then this key chain may be of little use to you). I decided to deduct one star due to potential problems with the plug design and not easily being able to plug (fit) the cables into some devices with large cases.NOTE: I was sent a free product sample for review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JLQU9DC" id="B00JLQU9DC-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-09:</strong> This is a very cleverly-designed little USB cable.  The flashing colors make it easily seen (I happen to have a yellow copy) and the six-inch cable is just long enough to be carried as a key chain or other short mobile cable.I can not speak for its durability, but this soft rubber outer cover does keep some dust and dirt off the cable openings.  However, the &#34;hippo's mouth&#34; does not provide for complete cover and dust will get into the sensitive cable contacts.  The rubber itself is very pliable.Having connectors for both i-Products and non-iProducts is also very handy, making this key chain useful for many users.  I personally will not use this as a key chain per se, as here in Arizona we simply have too much dust in the air.

Anyone ever see a hippo with a different colored ring around one eye?  Or a hippo with pointy ears or horns?  I'm thinking no.That aside, what we have here is a little dual function USB cable.  Dual function in that it works with most every iOS and Android device.  I'd call it an emergency cable, given that it's fitted with a key ring and the cord length is tiny.  Not something I'd want to use every day, but would work in a pinch.  A serious pinch, unless connecting up to an external battery, laptop, tablet, or, you have a USB extension cable/hub within easy reach.  The material used is of good quality, and the whole assembly is done well.Really, this is a cutesy product I'd never buy.  However, the moment my work wife saw it, she was all over it.  It's on her keyring now, where she likes to show it off to her friends.

It's basically a multi-function cable that has USB on one end and lightning and micro USB on the other end. The cable is wrapped up inside a cute little blue Hippo that is made of silicone. It's really quite adorable and I think most kids would get a kick out of it.The cable itself is about 6 inches long when not in use it's held inside the Hippo. When you need to use it you pull it out of the Hippo's mouth and stretch it out. Don't worry the Hippo is tough and you won't hurt him. I have used it to charge my phone with the micro USB cable and it has worked fine. It also works well to charge my iPad Mini but it may be difficult to use while your iPad or iPad Mini is in a case.This cable is inexpensive and the Hippo is so cute. It works well and I think it was a brilliant idea. I would recommend this for your young ones; I think they will enjoy it.Sample provided for review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JLQU9DC" id="B00JLQU9DC-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-03:</strong> This is an adorable cable, whoever came up with this idea is genuinely creative. This is a short microUSB / Apple Lightning cable stuffed inside the head of a hippopotamus. Go figure, a hippopotamus.Cute design aside, this is a good solid cable. The flat cable is made with really thick insulation. The cable ends are big and rubbery, so they will take a lot of abuse. The input side of the cable (the rectangular USB plug) looks big but in fact is just about the standard size for a cable end. You shouldn't have space issues with the connector. The business end is another story - they insulation is also big and rubbery. There are two connectors on that one end and they are in a Y formation. If you have a thick case, this connector might not work. If the connectors were 90 or 180 degrees apart, case thickness might not be a problem.OK, on to the fun part of this cable. When you take it out of the package, the hippo head is pulled down over the connector ends, and a key ring is visible. You slide the hippo head toward the key ring. Once the ends are visible, simply grab them and pull them apart. The hippo head will slide up over the key ring and allow you to use the cable straightened out. With the hippo head on the key ring, it looks like a frog that is grabbing lunch.This is an adorable cable that works well if you don't have a thick case.I was provided a review sample.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JLQU9DC" id="B00JLQU9DC-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-18:</strong> This cable is sooooo clever!This is a short cable with a USB connector on one end and two connectors on the other end:  micro USB and Lightning for Apple devices.  All this is bundled up in a keychain with a cute hippo head on it.  What a clever way to ensure that you have your two most-used cables with you at all times.The first thing I noticed when I tried this out is that I didn't get the nagging message telling me that the cable isn't compatible with my Apple device.  Most of my Lightning cables are cheap third-party knock offs.  I've gotten used to this annoying message; it's fine with me as long as the cable actually charges my phone.  But I'm much happier when I don't get that message, because sometimes the phone truly doesn't recognize the cable and doesn't charge.  I have a couple other Zeetron cables and they are all very reliable like this one.Honestly the design of this keychain fob doesn't really fit my personality.  It just doesn't go with my big diesel pickup truck.  But I'm also a geek who works for a major technology organization.  At work, geeks are cool.  So I put a little clip on it (search for "trigger hook" here on Amazon to see what I'm talking about, or see the link in my comment below) and clipped it onto my laptop bag.  Now I have a handy-dandy dual use charge cable right at my fingertips whenever I'm at work or travelling.This is a super clever design and incredibly useful.  And even if you don't love the hippo motif, just cut it off and still use the handy little cable.I was provided this item for review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JLQU9DC" id="B00JLQU9DC-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-11:</strong> ZEETRON selected a clever name for this portable USB charger. Though it is bulky for a key chain, for the contents of this rubber Hippo head the services are compact. It serves as a connector for charging via the USB end for devices using USB and a two headed Lightning USB for iPhone 5S, 5, and iPod devices and a micro USB for Samsung, Nokia, HTC, Blackberry, and LG devices. The only item missing from the kit is a charging source! But of course with all the power banks, wall chargers, and car chargers floating around, everyone has plenty of sources for power - just not enough readily available connectors. This little gadget helps correct that problem. Take it anywhere, charge multiple devices while in the car or on a trip. Works well and is clever to boot.

Here's the dealbreaker: this charges extremely slowly. Unacceptably slowly. I first tried it with my iPhone 5 by connecting this cable to my laptop, which is how I almost always charge my phone. Results: In 20 minutes, it charged 2 percentage points. Yes, 2. Also, when I first connected it, I got the &#34;This accessory might not be supported.&#34; That's never a good sign, because in my experience, that's a good indication that the cable will completely fail in a month or less.I then tried it with my iPad Air, and the results were even worse. This time, I connected the cable to the iPad Air wall charger (again, this is how I typically charge this device with other cables), and after 12 minutes, it had not charged at all.The lightning connector also has a worryingly tight fit. It takes a bit of force to get the connector into my phone and my iPad, but disconnecting it is even harder. I have to pull quite hard, and I'm genuinely concerned that the force that I have to use could cause the connector to break off in my device.When I look closely at the tip of the lightning connector, I can see some very small scratches and one gouge. Could that be causing the problems? My Apple cable, which I've had for more than six months and use on a daily basis, doesn't have a single visible scratch.This is a shame, because this cable could have been uniquely useful. I was looking forward to having a cable that I could keep stashed in my bag, without worrying that it would get damaged.Note: I received a sample of the product in exchange for an honest review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JLQU9DC" id="B00JLQU9DC-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-07:</strong> Perhaps I am spoiled, but I recently evaluated a great little Zeetron keychain charger and was hoping this would be a cuter version of the same.  It's a great idea, but I'm not totally sold on the execution as I will explain.What you get here is a short USB to both lightning and micro-USB cable (both on one end) that is looped through a keychain.  A hollow flexible hippo-head slides down the cable to cover up the cable ends.  By pushing the cable through, you can easily plug it into a USB port or a charger and charge up your Apple product with lightning cable input (iPhone, iPad, etc) or a device with a Micro-USB input.  For those of us who have a bluetooth headset with Micro-USB, it is nice to have both on 1 cable.  The cable itself seems high quality and sturdy with enough flex to make it easy to reach between devices.The problem I had is that the lightning cable is not extended off of the plastic block at all - it is flush with the block.  That means if you have any sort of case on your phone at all, even a thin one, the cable won't work (my phone is in an Amazon Basics case).  Zeetron addressed this already with theirZeetron Ultra Compact Emergency Keychain Usb Cable - Black Lighting to USB (For Iphone 5, 5c, 5s, Ipad 4, Air, Mini, Ipod Touch 5th Gen)by having the lightning cable on a small extension block.  This extension was good enough to get past the thin case on my iPhone.  Unfortunately, this design feature didn't make it onto the hippo.So ultimately, it's a really really cute keychain and a great idea, but I can't carry it because the lightning connector won't mate with my iPhone while in the case.  If you carry a naked iPhone, then this is a great way to always have a cable by your side.Note: I received a free sample from the manufacturer for the purposes of review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JLQU9DC" id="B00JLQU9DC-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-19:</strong> This is a quality charging cord, I received this as a review sample from Zeetron. It is a very cute hippo head that has the charging cord coming out of it's mouth. When it is closed, it looks really cute. It is a light blue silicone material that feels and looks really nice.The cords themselves work nicely and is a good combo for me because I can charge my iPhone with the Apple 8 pin and something else with the universal micro-USB.Unlike some of the other cords I bought, this one connects to my computer and let's me sync stuff from iTunes.

This attempts to bridge that gap. The Zeetron Cute Hippo 2 in 1 USB cable, as it says, is cute and it's rubber. You reach in the beastie's mouth, pull gently on its tongue and you get the plugs to pluck out.While this is not a toy and I suspect a child or impatient adult might yank the cord from the wire and rip the rubber ring, with care, this offers a few inches so you can use the Micro and main USB or iPhone-compatible plug to charge or connect.It is a bit of a tight fit, as there's not much room to maneuver and devices need to be in very close proximity. Of course, this is the limit of a pair of cords that can be stuffed back in the hippo's maw. But, if this is possible, and no tension on cord or jack remains, this can work to solve the problem of a cable and a portable version that, on a key ring or carabiner, can not be misplaced as easily as a random cord.

But behind the cute factor (which makes it fun to keep on a keychain) it is functional. It has a cable tucked into the hippo with a USB on one end and a split micro USB or Apple Lightning connector on the other. I've been using it for the USB to micro USB connection.It works well, maybe not as quickly as some of my other cables but it is a little short. So it will do in a pinch or for some uses, like with a powerbank but it is a tight fit for other places. You would have trouble connecting to a car charger or something that you would need visible access to your phone.The cables pull back into the hippo head for safety and storage.I was provided a unit for testing and review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JLQU9DC" id="B00JLQU9DC-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-07:</strong> This is a key chain that has a USB, micro usb, and Apple 8-pin lightning connector attached to it for emergency situations.There are no instructions to this product but all you need to do is push the strap inward and the connectors will come out of the Hippo's mouth.  When not using the cables, pull the strap outward from the hippo's head and the cables will go into the hippo's mouth.The micro usb and lightning connector have a short depth which makes it extremely difficult to connect them to a micro device.  If you have the Samsung Note 2 with an OtterBox case then the micro usb will not fit, the color part of the device (mine blue) will get in the way.  If the plastic between the two micro prongs was V shaped then this device would work better.Once you connect the micro end of this device to your phone, you must be extremely close to the USB port, because the cord is not that long, so it is almost impossible to plug the single end into a USB charger.  This device is OK in emergency situations but not for long term everyday use.The quality of this device is MUCH better than what the picture shows.  The straps coming from the hippo's mouth, on the photo, look flimsily.  In reality, they are not, the plastic straps are pretty durable.I love this idea, but the device needs a few design changes like longer straps and a V cut between the two micro plugs.  As it is now, this product is just not ready for prime time, but it is still a decent device. If you think of it as being connector cables with a key chain then you might be disappointed.

It's a keychain (if you want it to be) that is made in the shape of a hippo with one big grey black eye.  If you push the top down, the cables come out the bottom - one side is USB, and the other is a micro charger and a lightening charger.I find it is very convenient to use with an external battery pack to recharge in my purse.  Now, you don't get a lot of cable - spreading it out there's only about 4" there to work with, but I find it is a good size and really cute for a key chain, and it makes it easy to use a battery pack with my HTC One X or Kindle.To retract it, just pull up the top key-ring and it's like the hippo eats the cables up and hides them inside.  The Hippo also has little devil horns.  He's really cute.  Might want to be careful to keep him around babies, the hippo looks like a toy and feels very soft and they are going to want to gnaw on him for sure.You should choose another style charging cable if you need to have a longer distance between your USB port and your device.

This is one of those accessories.First, the pros:  it serves double duty: USB --> Lightning or Micro cable; and it's a functional small key ring.  Since I usually keep my car and house keys separate, I tend to use at least 2 key rings, and this could easily serve as one of them, which would give me a usable charging cable 24/7.It's brightly colored, so it's easy to spot in my bag.  It appears to be well made, sturdy, and unless unusually badly handled, it's not likely to rip or tear.  Should last awhile.The lightning attachment fits my iPhone 5S snugly, but not *too* snug -- in other words, it's fairly easy to plug it in.  I have a case on my iPhone, and it fits fine without having to remove the case.It seems to charge relatively quickly on the lightning attachment -- not as fast as the original Apple cable/etc., but would work fine to recharge overnight.  I didn't get an "incompatible" message, so my iPhone is happy with it.Cons:  My only quibble with this is the length of the cable.  You release the cable by pushing it through the hippo's "mouth," but even fully extended, you have barely 2" from USB to hippo and dual-headed lightning/micro to hippo.  This means that you'll need to be careful where you charge -- I have mine charging right now next to my laptop via the USB port on the computer, and it's fine.  I don't see how you could use your device WHILE it's charging -- there's just not enough "play" in the cable to allow for that.  Just something to think about.This would make a nice stocking stuffer -- a novelty item that actually serves a useful purpose.

An illustration on the packaging would have helped, but with a little experimenting I found that if I pushed on the strap that holds the keyring a set of USB connectors will emerge from the rubber hippo's mouth.That yellow hippo's head is much more than a cute decorative element - it actually protects the USB connectors against dust, moisture and grime. The cable is flat (it's the strap that extends and retracts the connectors as well as holds the keyring), and is very sturdy.I love the fact that it contains both a micro USB and Apple 8-pin lightning connector. I have both devices, so one charging and synching cable meets all of my needs. I tested it as a charging cable on an iPhone 5S and a Samsung Galaxy Note 3, plus an HTC Droid Incredible. There were no problems with any of the three devices.This is not a cable that you would use all the time. It's there for those times when you wish you had one and then remember that do do - it's your keychain.  One other thing I love is I have the yellow model so it's easy to spot when I sit my keys down. Yeah, some folks wonder what a sixty-five year old man is doing with something that looks like a baby toy, but I encourage them to think I am senile so they will move on without bothering me.Bottom line: this is an inexpensive way to always have a synching and charging cable handy if your device uses either micro USB or Apple lightning connectors (or both). Plus you have a choice of colors.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JLQU9DC" id="B00JLQU9DC-review23" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-11:</strong> I love this hippo usb cable.  I can charge either my sons ipod, my iphone or my kindle fire, without having three different cords laying around.  Just plug into my laptop and charge.The hippo is made of a durable silicone.  The charging cable fits nicely in the hippos when not in use.  Which protects them from dust.  Wish the cords were a little longer.  You can only charge one device, and it needs to not have a bulky case on them in order for the plug to go in.  This is a nifty little gadget that serves the purpose it was made for well.Reviewed by Elisa for New Age mama.

One end of the cable is a standard USB connector; the other end has both a Lightning connector and a micro-USB connector. Since I don't have any Apple equipment, I was only able to test the micro-USB connector.The cable does what it claims, providing a compact alternative to connect your device to a charging station. My problem with the cable is that it's quite short and the decorative hippo cuts off a significant portion. For normal use, you'll get about one inch of cable on each end, perhaps 1.5 inches if you really squeeze the hippo up over the folded over portion of the cable around the keyring. I've uploaded a customer image of the cable in use, connecting a phone to an external battery pack charger so that you can see.I tested the cable by using it to connect my external battery pack to my dumb phone and my smart phone. For that usage, it works very well, and it's a lot easier to carry around than the three-foot cable I'm accustomed to using. I keep the cable and the battery pack in my backpack and often find myself using them on the bus home from work. The hippo cable has now become my cable of choice for this activity.The problem with the cable, and the reason that it doesn't get a higher rating, is that the scenarios I can use it for are pretty limited:- I can't use it on the USB ports on my primary computer since I'd have to find some way to prop up the device I'm charging high enough to reach.- I can't use it to plug into my charger plug on the wall for the same reason.- I can sort of use it to plug into the charging port on my six-outlet extension cord with dual-USB charging port but that would mean putting the device on the floor, which isn't where I want it. (And knowing my clumsiness and forgetfulness, that would be a recipe for disaster.)- I can sort of use it in the car but only if I'm willing to prop the device up at an odd angle and not use the device while it's charging (assuming I'm the passenger, of course).- I can sort of use it plugged into my laptop but then can't really use the device well while it's charging.All of these other scenarios work just fine with a 3-foot USB to micro-USB cable. For my purposes, the only place I can use this is to connect my external battery pack to my phone. For that use, it's great and it's easier to carry around than what I was using. If that's your primary use or you just need an emergency backup, then I can definitely recommend this, as it seems sturdy and it works well. If you need something more flexible, I recommend looking elsewhere.Disclaimer: The manufacturer provided a sample for review purposes with no restrictions on the review outcome.

For the rest of us, it seems to work well but the short length of the doubled-over cable limits practical use.Tested with my son's HTC Droid DNA by charging the DNA via laptop and power bank connections. The USB and micro USB connectors fit perfectly into every port, and charging occurred as expected. No issue at all with performance, only with design.The unit's charging cable is fed through the hippo's mouth and through the top of its head, then through a key ring, and then back down through the hippo. This effectively cuts the usable length of the cord in half... but then the hippo's head sits over half of the remaining space, really only leaving about one inch of cable to play with.That was workable, though still a confined fit, when charging from a laptop port as we could lay the phone on top of the laptop (see picture). It was also workable when charging from a power bank, as the phone and bank can be laid down next to each other too.  However, it was not workable from our USB enabled outlet or from plug-in USB power adapters as they all are at wall outlet height (typically 10 to 16 inches off of the floor or counter)... and the cable just can't reach.If you would like to see pictures of the hippo unit we received, please navigate to its main sales page and then scroll down to where the "Most Helpful Customer Reviews" section starts -- look to the right of that area for the "Product Images From Customers" section, and our pictures are there. It is a nice looking unit that feels good in the hand.The Amazon sales listing notes that this item includes a one year warranty, so if an issue arises within that time period I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I did receive this cable gratis from the manufacturer and have put it through the paces to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.If you are looking for a cute novelty for the tech savvy secondary school kid in your life, a USB charging cable of this size, style and design for use similar to what I have described above, then feel free to give this one a try. It is cute and it performs well, given the limitations noted above.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JLQU9DC" id="B00JLQU9DC-review26" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-09:</strong> The Zeetron Rubber Hippo USB Connector Cable has a handy key chain on one end and two 1/2 inch wide flat cables protruding from the bottom of the Hippo's mouth, each cable easily bends and pivots 90 degrees to accommodate attachment to devices with a USB connector on one end and a choice of either micro connector or lightning connector on the other end. The cables are rather short but I had no problem hooking a portable battery charger using the USB head and hooking an iPhone to the lightning connector or a Kindle to the micro connector on the other end. As an alternative, simply remove the keychain and pull out the cable and then there is 6 inches of USB to dual connectors cable to work with. When not in use, the cable connectors can be pulled into the hippo's head for safe storage, which then lengthens the key chain cable end. A very unique, humorous idea that solves the problem of always searching thru a glut of tangled cables for either type connector with a USB end. And it's easy to spot, coming in 5 different colors.

It has quickly become extremely useful in my life. I thought this little guy was an alien at first, but no-- it's a hippo!The special thing about this guy is that you can slide his head up to reveal a USB cable that plugs both into micro USB or lightning-- it's a universal connector! Perfect for any time you are on the go and need to charge in places where you didn't expect to need to.  I carry a flash drive on my keychain, in the same vane as this.The hippo head is quite soft rubber-- pliable and cool. I can't say that this is a great kids item because I don't know why kids would need their own, but it could also make a really cute gift. That being said, I'd prefer an alien. :)By a lot of hard hours and days and years of time spent reviewing, I found myself in the top 10 reviewers on Amazon.

Sure, I keep a charger in my car; carrying a charging cable is inconvenient and could get damaged in a bag or pocket. Zeetron has thought long and hard about a way to address this matter and come up with a solution to make it more convenient to bring one along with you:A keychain hippo.More specifically, a silicone keychain hippo that "regurgitates" two ends of a single cable; one end has a USB connector, the other has an "A"-shaped splitter with a micro-USB tip on one end and a lightning connector on the other. The keyring prevents the cord from being pulled completely out of the mouth; conversely, the connectors prevent the cable from being pulled out of the opening on top of the "head" of the hippo.When you are finished using the cable, simply pull up on the keyring and the hippo will "eat" the connectors, hiding them completely within the "head" of the unit. The excess cable will sprout from the top of the head of the hippo, resulting in the head hanging from the cord and becoming a "keychain" once again.While using this product is very simple, there are a few issues:* Since the cable is folded in half over the keyring, you do not have a lot of room to maneuver between plugging the USB adapter into a power source and then the appropriate charging tip into your device. As a result, you are limited to using this as a charger with USB ports that are near flat surfaces. Otherwise, your phone/device will be dangling precariously from the charging tip, as well as pulling against the USB plug and the port that your "hippo" is plugged into.* Unless you also choose to carry a USB/AC Outlet adapter as well, this keychain forces you to seek out USB charging sources. You will either need to carry an adapter, purchase a separate external battery/portable charger, or be aware of what options are available to you at your destination.* Even though there are two adapter tips available (micro-USB and a lightning connector), you are not going to be able to use both at the same time. There simply is not enough room between them on the A-frame.Unfortunately, most of the issues above are pretty important. That being said, if you purchase the Zeetron Hippo Charger as an emergency backup cable, then this is a good choice. It is handy if you forgot to charge your phone, lost your cable, or otherwise find yourself in a position where you have access to a power source (bit of a non-sequitur, but I really do strongly recommend purchasing a portable battery) but don't have your usual charging cable handy, then you can whip out your keys and go "I have my Hippo!".So, in conclusion, if you are considering the Zeetron Hippo as a primary charger, you will be disappointed. There are simply too many design flaws to consider this product as your first choice for charging your device(s). However, if you are buying this as a [cute] keychain fob to have on-hand for one of those times when you need a cable and are nowhere near home, then this is an excellent product!Oh, and did I mention that it is pretty cute, too? This would make a wonderful gift for that techie person in your life that has lots of little gadgets and would enjoy something different for his/her keychain!**Disclaimer: This hippo was sent to me by the manufacturer at no cost to review.

The entire cord is pretty short so you need an outlet that is close to a counter top or surface for laying your electronic on to charge.

I personally am not going to switch my keys over to this (I'm not a hippo-kinda guy), but I can see this being a great option for kids who might need a charging cable.The feature that makes this outstanding to me is that it has both a Lightning and micro-USB connector built into the plug. So in my case, one cable would serve both my iPhone 5S and my Kindle. The two ends of the USB cable are covered by the hippo head, and sliding the head down the cable exposes the two plugs. The rubber is pretty flexible, so it's not that difficult to work the plugs through the &#34;mouth&#34; of the hippo for use.The main down side is the length of the cable. The cable is about four inches, so there's two inches on each side once it's linked through the keyring. With the hippo head pushed up to the keyring, the effective overall length of the cable is about two inches, so you're going to have to be right next to the computer or power outlet to use it. Still, it's better than being completely without a cable when you desperately need to connect to a computer to synch up or recharge.For the price and looks, the Hippo cable is a pretty good deal (so long as you know the limitations).Disclosure:Obtained From: ManufacturerPayment: Free</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JLQU9DC" id="B00JLQU9DC-review33" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-24:</strong> This connector is useful and sweetly adorable. Who would expect that under a silly blue rubber Hippo head key chain lies a USB to Lightning or USB to Micro USB cable? I've already used it multiple times to connect a phone or iPod and each time it elicited giggles or smiles of appreciation by various bystanders of all ages. It's true that the cables are not very long, but you get about 3" by scrunching back the malleable Hippo head. This works under most emergency circumstances and it sure beats carrying separate cables around in your bag!

With products that need Lightning connectors, inexpensive often translates to incompatible, and many cables of this price will cause your device to give you a warning message. This one works perfectly. The hippo part is not only decorative, but functional. It protects the connectors when not in use, and I can't think of another self contained solution that so easily fits into a pocket.I was most interested in the Lightning connector for reasons given above, but more of my devices use the micro-USB connection. That one works well too.The cable itself is short, and when opened seems to be shorter than it appears in one of the photos. You will need to keep your devices close together to charge. In order to get more than the minimum amount of length, I had to push the hippo head up to the point that it started to turn inside out. However, it's flexible and well made enough that it won't hurt it. On the other hand if the cable were longer it wouldn't work well with this design. It's a necessary compromise.Aside from the more pragmatic issues, the obvious selling point is its appearance. It's most likely the design that will make you want to get it, and if you like the design, you will probably like the product.Note: A sample was provided to me but no review was promised in exchange.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00JLQU9DC" id="B00JLQU9DC-review35" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-09:</strong> Very portable.

This comes in two somewhat separate parts, the handlebar assembly and a removable case assembly.  If you take the "case" off the handlebar assembly, you have to snap it back into place perfectly or it will fall off quite easily at the first bump in the road.That being said, if you make sure the assembly is secure, it really is secure.  It normally takes me a few times of removing and putting it back before it won't fall off.  I check this before I ride every time, even though I never take the case off.  It seems like if I bump it just right in my garage, it gets loose again.  I'm glad my phone has an insurance policy.I can operate my phone somewhat through the plastic, but it is hard to do when you're riding.  I mostly wanted it to display my runkeeper stats while cycling, so that's not a problem for me.  The ball joint is adjustable so I haven't had a major problem with glare (a little is to be expected).Overall a good case.  I wish the case assembly and handlebar assembly were a single piece, but I guess I can see where others would want to remove the whole case when parking their bikes (personally, I just take the phone out).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0047ELBOE" id="B0047ELBOE-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-23:</strong> I got it for My I phone But its not really what I was expected the value of this is great what I mean its worth your money but I had to use it for my Navigation instead of my iPhone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0047ELBOE" id="B0047ELBOE-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-13:</strong> that is all i need , pretty cool , waterproof and with good lock system and most important part is u can use ur smartphone while its inside it witch for me its pretty coolbefore receiving it i was kind of worry about quality of product but now i totally recommend this product :)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0047ELBOE" id="B0047ELBOE-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-01:</strong> Without the case, I can just attach my Garmin directly to the handlebar mount.

The case is really a &#34;system&#34; with 3 components: 1) a thin rubberized case that is not much bigger than the phone, 2) a kickstand back that dovetails and fits perfectly with the rubberized case, and 3) a rugged belt clip housing that the first two items snaps into.The rubberized case could be used by itself for lightweight protection. The only weakness here is that the corners are &#34;thin&#34; because that how it integrates with the kickstand back. But if you don't drop your phone a lot this could be all you need.The kickstand back adds a lot more protection to the corners, it provides a solid back and of course it gives you a kickstand capability, only in landscape mode however. I use it often as I read a lot of news and watch video on my phone so it's very handy.For travel, put the above combination in the belt clip housing. The phone goes in display-first against the solid back that has a nice felt lining - very nice touch! It locks in securely to a notch on the kickstand and has a heavy duty belt clip that rotates 90 degrees.Overall its a very clever system, solid and well-built, that has 3 options depending on the protection and features you need.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005TOCVQI" id="B005TOCVQI-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-09:</strong> Admittedly, I wasn't sure exactly what I was getting....but I love this.  The stand is a little hard to pop out - but that could also be a good thing.

After realizing that the screen faces inward when on the belt clip holder, I have used it every day and have loved it.

It has static if I put the phone in my shirt pocket! Since I haven't done a baseline test of the phone with other bluetooth headsets, I can't say if it is the headset or the phone, but either way, if you buy one of these and have the same problem, make sure and return it within the return period.Another problem is the plastic ear holder (the part that holds the headset to your ear). This is a bad design and honestly, there is no way to get this thing to properly and confortably fit my ear. The only way to wear it is to have half your ear lobe hanging out, which result in a lot of pain within 10min or so. Avoid this headset if you want wear a headset for extended periods of time.A final note: The wind blocking technology works well, but at the expense of a high quality sound transmission to your recipent. I've asked a few of my techno-geek-friends when I'm talking to them with the headset, and they all say that the sound quality seems to be missing a full dynamic range.Good luck!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00069IQG0" id="B00069IQG0-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2005-10-24:</strong> I bought the Logitech after reading numerous reviews on various brands.

It recently had no problems keeping up with a four hour Skype session!It is also capable of pairing with multiple devices, so you can for instance use it with your computer at home and your cell phone on the road without having to redo the pairing every time, something cheap brand-X headsets don't do.Logitech was kind enough to supply a very tiny charger, perfect if you take your headset on the road. For those international trips, no problem: it can handle 100 to 240 volts and 50 to 60 Hz (translation for the technologically challenged: you can use it anywhere in the world, just get a cheap prong adapter)On the negative side, it's possible to jam the connector into the headset the wrong way if you're not careful. Of course the battery won't charge up and the light won't go on, a dead giveaway. It caused no damage to my headset, but the connector design could be better.I found this headset very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. The volume is loud and the sound quality is very clear. People on the other side liked the sound quality as well.There are a few negative points that cost this otherwise excellent headset a star:* after 10 minutes of inactivity, it goes to low-power mode "sleep". When the phone it is paired with rings, it may take up to 5 rings for it to wake up and start ringing. If you press the answer button before the headset starts ringing, you will lose the call. If you want to answer right away, you can always answer on the phone but if you do so pressing the answer button on the headset will not transfer the call to the headset like it did on my Sony Ericsson HBH headset, but hang up. To transfer the call to the headset, use the appropriate menu on the phone instead.* The ring on the headset is an irritating, non-modifiable melody. It would be nice to have a few options!* The headset is fairly large and dorky-looking.Despite these few drawbacks, don't forget that this is a very capable, well made and reliable headset at a bargain basement price, one of the best out there. If you can live with the looks, it's a super deal.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00069IQG0" id="B00069IQG0-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2006-03-16:</strong> the "behind the ear" thing just broke...I baby my stuff and treat it VERY lightly, and this piece of junk just fell apart!!!Very dissapointed!!!I should have made my additions to this review long ago, but Logitech cam through for me on this headset in a huge way!

My ear is well within normal range of size and shape, but was bent out of shape by the headset.On the positive, wind noise and lost connections -- common criticisms of other BT headsets -- was not a problem here.  If you don't care about medium to long term fit and comfort, or the aesthetics of walking around with such an large unit hanging off your ear, you may be happy with this headset.

Here are the reasons:- 7-8 Hours talk time- True 30 feet range- Wind filter for clear talking- Small and comfortable, doesn't intrude your ear- Crazy price, huge quality- Warranty and reliability of Logitech!I've used a Sony Ericsson and Jabra BT200 and I would say the Jabra is much better than Sony Ericsson, but the Logitech blows them both away.  It's faster to put on the Logitech and the range is much better.  The microphone is clear and crisp and the speaker volume is loud and sufficient.For me, I used a Jabra A210 bluetooth adapter for a Sprint Sanyo 8100 phone w/2.5mm headset jack.  It gave me BT on my phone so I could use this headset.  The auto-answer and hang up depends on your phone whether it would normally do so with a headset or not.

I wanted to use a wireless headset and VoIP to make international calls, mostly from hotel rooms. This headset did not work out of the box for my situation. The Logitech support website was great. It said to upgrade the notebook's bluetooth software. The HP site was also excellent. I downloaded bluetooth and many other newer drivers. Once installed, the headset immediately worked as docuemented. The other newer drivers solved all the weird hibernation problems I've been experiencing too. I'm using Skype for VoIP service. Skype setup has an option for using the bluetooth headset for Skype only, otherwise the normal audio devices are used. All in all, installation was a bit of upgrade work but competently supported. I now have a VoIP connected wireless headset that allows me mobile freedom. Due to my usage, I have no comment on the audio quality or useability with mobile phones. The device apparently will not work with the majority of PocketPCs due to a lack of bluetooth software. Thus I only gave it 4 stars.

Fit and comfort is extremely subjective but I found the Jabra to be far more comfortable (I would actually forget I was wearing it); that said, this unit is not uncomfortable (until after a couple hours) just not nearly AS comfortable or securely fitting.Very few complaints as far as performance. It was easy to pair with my phone, my wife's Motorola V3 and even my laptop. Sound quality is clear for both parties (recipients occasionally complained of a pinging noise with the Jabra) and the noise reduction actually works to eliminate wind noise. Battery life is excellent. The single function can be a little aggrevating (especially when trying to turn it off as you have to hold it down for a long time). The only weird and very rare quirk is occassionally calls will be interrupted with a strange sound that sounds like someone dropping a manhole cover as it spins on pavement - very strange, very annoying and fortunately very rare.Overall, performance is top notch, comfort is acceptable and value is difficult to beat.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00069IQG0" id="B00069IQG0-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2005-07-31:</strong> I have been using this for a month.PROS:It is a good value.  It works really well, and it lasts a very long time on a charge.  The WindStop feature works very well.  People have been able to hear me very well while driving and even while playing volleyball.  It stays on the ear well but is not uncomfortable.CONS:The unit looks okay but is less attractive than some of the other high-tech units on the market.  3 of my co-workers have commented that it looks like I am wearing a phallic symbol on my ear, which is really not the look I would like to achieve.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00069IQG0" id="B00069IQG0-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2006-02-10:</strong> Because I spent a lot of time on the phone, I am very particular about BT headsets.  I have tried every brand of BT headset you can imagine, I mean EVERY brand.  I was so frustrated to a point I was ready to go back to wired headset until I ran into this little guy.  This is by far the best one, hands down.  My most miserable experence was with Jabra and Motorola.  I had a lot of connection and audio quality issues with those brands.BT headset designers seem to favor visual appeal rather than performance.  I don't understand by most headsets on the market are short and stubby, in which the microphone is right next to your ear instead of your month.  Having microphone that far away results in having to turn up the microphone sensitivity, which cause the headset to pick up everything including background noise.  Lack of an effective noise-filtering system such as the one in this Logitech headset, you end up with wind noise, car noise, AC noise, every kind of noise but your voice.  In additional, the close promixity between the speak and microphone creates a feedback loop for a nice serving of constant echoing.  I lost count of the occasions when my friends and coworkers on the other end of the phone tell me to "get off your crappy Jabra BT headset" or "take me off your Motorola BT headset".  I am amazed that people on the other end can easily tell it's a Jabra BT headset because the horrid sound quality.Onto this gem, the sound quality is amazing, by far the best of the bunch.  The WindStop system really does work.  Together with the farther extending microphone, this unit produce the best sound both incoming and outgoing.  I know many users complaining about the fit, but it's really a fault of the user.  As one reviewer pointed out, there is a "correct" way to wear this, and I think it provides an excellent fit and comfort.I can't speak for all, but I personally don't wear a BT headset as a fashion statement.  I use it as a mean for convenience and safety, so sound quality and fit are top factors for my consideration.  On that note, this is a clear winner.  I wish product managers and designers at Motorola and particularly Jabra take note of that.  Jabra (250 and 250v models) being the worst with it's behind the ear design and a heavy-trigger button is really a very lousy product in terms of usability and sound quality.  I am sure customers that raved about Jabra would rank this unit out of this world!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00069IQG0" id="B00069IQG0-review21" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2006-06-04:</strong> Good reception.

The Legend headset was costly enough as it is.Ok, so my fault for not realizing this before I purchased the headset, I assumed the headset would be compatible with the average charger. There are so many electronic gadgets, adapters, chargers etc ... filling up drawers, boxes and the like all over the country that Plantronics should be more environmentally friendly and do what everyone else is supposedly doing and make their chargers universal.

But it is not so easy to quickly replace on the spot if you misplace or lose it, as happened to me. On-the-street replacements from some retailers can be costly.ThePlantronics Voyager Legend Charge Cableis a good one, and the new magnetic snap-fit connector has proven to be a good one when attached to thePlantronics Voyager Legend Bluetooth Headset. The connector works well in that if someone bumps or jerks the cord, the headset will pop off of the socket safely, without damaging the connector or headset. It's reminiscent of the MagSafe power connector that is found on the MacBook Pro, which keeps keeps that computer from crashing to the floor is someone trips over the power cord.The shortcoming with this cord is that it's only 9-inches long, though that's not an issue for many. The price is OK for a proprietary cord that works, but there is a far better choice for Voyager Legend owners. ThePlantronics Voyager Legend microUSB Charge Adapteris a far better buy than than the original replacement, as it includes a 24-inch USB to micro-USB charge cable that plugs into the magnetic snap-fit connector. The product images show that it has a short tether, which allows the connector to be attached to the cable so that it doesn't get lost.I had lost my original charges cable when visiting a client site, and was surprised that many retailers did not carry this cable as a replacement. When I finally did locate one locally at a major cell phone store, it was at a substantially higher price. Lesson learned, the hard way.Compare both the price and specs between the replacement Voyager Legend Charge Cable here and the more versatilePlantronics Voyager Legend microUSB Charge Adapter. At the time of this review, this multi-function adapter only costs $3.00 more than the original replacement, so there are better choices available.6/10/2013</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009UNH0EM" id="B009UNH0EM-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-04:</strong> Lost my cable and to my surprise, it was less expensive here than direct from the manufacturer.

At first, I was puzzled at the occasional lack of charging. My Plantronics earpiece normally charges to a full 7 hour charge in a very short time, even when very low on charge. But sometimes I'd have it charging on this for 30 minutes and check to find the time left was still as it was before charging. It has progressed to the point where it won't charge at all.I have cleaned the contacts with a swab and 99% isopropyl on both the charge cable and the earpiece. The earpiece continues to charge without issues on other charge cables. I tried this charge cable on different USB charge adapters. The problem stays with the charge cable.I've noticed in searching online that others have had problems with Plantronics charge cable, so I've ordered another after-market charge cable.

The screen was very clear, and the camera was very good.  The performance was much better than a Samsung unit that I used to have. The memory and storage is very generous and sufficient for most users. There are a few items of bloatware on this device, but unfortunately everyone seems to include their own on the phone.  The user interface is not the usual android, although once you get used to it, it does everything that other interfaces do.Now to the negative points. The phone would not recognize 32GB cards, not even 16GB cards.  It would only accept 8GB cards.  The card enclosure was very flimsy, and that might have been the problem, although I am not sure. The phone deleted a few of my applications after I rebooted the system.  I guess that was the last straw.  I sent it back.  The positives of this phone are much better than other phones of the $120 range, and I am hoping that I got a rare dud. I could be tempted to go back and try another unit of this phone again, hoping that the other unit will not have the negatives of this one.Update for the second unitThis device has good telephone, camera, and display. The general performance of the computer part of this unit is very good - for things such as GPS, WIFI, mp3, download speed, and battery life.  Unfortunately, there are a few rough edges on this phone. The phone does not accept some memory cards (five out of the six that I tried) .  The camera settings are a bit primitive.  The autocorrect feature of the email text is very primitive.  These defects are annoying but tolerable.  I tried calling the customer service on these issues.  The one time that I was able to get through, the representative could not offer any helpful suggestions except to send the unit back.  All other times, the line was busy.All told, this is a middle-of-the-line unit, and it is priced very reasonably - less than half of the known brands with the same specifications.  In all fairness, even the known brands have their own flaws and rough edges.  I am changing my original rating of two stars to four stars.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00B7NAFI6" id="B00B7NAFI6-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-30:</strong> I purchased this phone in hopes to replace the smart phone I purchased while in the Philippines (Cherry Mobile Flare).  The Blu Dash 4.0 D270a doesn't quite stand up to the performance of the Cherry Mobile Flare, but since the Flare doesn't work in the United States, it is a pretty close replacement.  Overall I'm pretty pleased with it so far.  But like anything there are positives as well as negatives with anything.  Some of the specs provided on Amazon and Blu's website ([...]) are a little off.  Not anything major but I will run down those and the minor negative points of the phone in this review.[website & amazon specs]:4GB with 512MB RAM; Dual Core 1GHz Cortex-A5; 5MP camera (main)/ 0.3MP camera (front); 4 inch screen / 480x800 pixels; Android 4 operating system; Dual Sim Card GSM 850/ 900/ 1800/ 1900 Mhz/ UMTS 850/ 1900 Mhz; 3G HSDPA (AT&T; only)/GPRS/EDGE/Wifi; Wifi hotspot capable; A-GPS support; SMS/MMS messaging; micro sd card support up to 32GBThe only thing I found to be a little off, was the main storage size of the phone.  The phone reads in settings, and also in other apps I have downloaded, that the total size of the hard drive is 2GB not 4GB.  That's a nice chunk of space for the phone, but I still put a 32GB micro sd card in it for more storage.  The 512MB of RAM is not that impressive, but it handles most of everything I need my phone for.  If you are the type of person that likes to download a lot of games, maybe it won't be enough for you.  The Android version is 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich.I currently use AT&T;'s Go Phone service and the phone had no problem identifying the network.  I wasn't sure if I would have to manually enter the APN settings, but the phone picks it all up automatically.  I've had another unlocked phone with Unnecto, and I had to enter all that info in manually which took some time to research.  I use the second SIM slot for my Philippine SMART sim card.  It reads it just fine, and is set to roaming (which uses the AT&T; network).  The good thing is that this phone will also work when you travel abroad.  I have not used T-Mobile with this phone, but according to what I've read, the 2G connection will work, but the 3G will only work with AT&T.;  The fact that the phone also has the ability to be a mobile hotspot is also a plus.One annoyance that I've found with the firmware of this phone is setting up certain contact info and ringtones.  For some reason the phone would reset certain contact settings I had made to default.  The problem has seemed to stop, but it was irritating at first.  Trying to set custom ringtones for contacts is also an annoyance.  Unlike the Cherry Mobile Flare I own, Blu Dash 4.0 doesn't give you a menu in the sound settings to choose from your custom MP3's.  You have to open them in the audio player, and then set them as your main ringtone for sim 1 or sim 2.  I have yet to find a way to set your custom ringtones for individual contacts.  When you go to set the individual ringtone for the contact, the regular ring tone menu pops up, and is all that you can choose from.Another downside to this phone, is that I haven't been able to find much as far as accessories go.  I contacted BLU through their website, and they referred me to an online dealer that had some BLU accessories, but nothing for the Dash 4.0.  It would be nice to have a skin or case to protect the phone, but they just don't have one out that I know of.  Universal screen protectors are easy to find, so you can trim them to custom fit the phone no problem.  I've also tried a few different headset/mics in this phone, and only the one that came with it seems to work properly.  The others will work as a headset, but the mics won't work for some reason.  I have not tried to use this phone with a blutooth headset, but the phone is blutooth capable.Battery life is not the greatest.  If you are using the phone pretty regularly to surf the web, or download apps it drains the battery faster.  Certain apps can also eat the battery pretty quickly, so I've found that disabling them when not in use is the best way to avoid killing your battery.  When using the phone moderately, the battery has lasted through out the day, but usually by night, you will need to plug it up.Overall, I would say that if your looking for a dual sim smart phone that won't break the bank, the BLU Dash 4.0 D270a is a pretty good choice.  Blu also offers other smart phones with better specs, but they are quite a bit more expensive.  $130.00 was more than what I paid for my Cherry Mobile Flare, but I don't think that you will find anything in the United States this cheap without having a contract phone.  Unlocked phones are nice, and offer you the freedom of choice with your service.Hopefully this review is helpful to anyone considering purchasing an unlocked smart phone.Update 4/6/2013 :Check the comments to see how to resolve the ringtone issue.I have also encountered a slight problem with sending MMS messages.  When I attempt to send them I get an error.  Looking at the APN settings, everything is as it should be, so I'm not sure why it's not working.  I've sent photos through different apps with no problem, but attaching them to a MMS, I always get this error.  Maybe it's an issue with AT&T;, but I will update if the problem is resolved.Update 4/7/2013 :MMS error resolved.  I had to download a messaging app from the google play store, but it seems to have fixed the problem.  I am finding out that the built in functions for this phone are not the best.  But fortunately you can download free apps to solve the issues you might run into.  I downloaded Handcent SMS and now I can send my MMS messages without recieving an error.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00B7NAFI6" id="B00B7NAFI6-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-07:</strong> good phone, for child</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00B7NAFI6" id="B00B7NAFI6-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-02:</strong> great team at a great price, including cheap phones is one of the best, pretty hot, but because I gave it a really exaggerated use, but nothing that does not give any other.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00B7NAFI6" id="B00B7NAFI6-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-01:</strong> First of all, this phone is a very good value at about $120. You have a recent version of the Android OS, a wide range of Android applications can be installed, and the screen is responsive without lag.Here are the two shortcomings I noticed, which, if important to you, might be deal-breakers, even at this low price:Poor camera---The captured video is of very poor quality when using any decent settings (i.e. H264 at 720p, or even MPEG4 at 480p). Very blocky, low frame rate; it's as if the processor can't keep up with the data input (Yes, I did try recording direct to internal memory so as to rule out slow SD card: no better). Still pictures are OK, but tend to be rather dark and missing detail at 5 MP AUTO settings. So, you wouldn't buy this phone for more than very casual use as a still camera, and probably only for send-by-message-or-email video. I was also unable to get the flash to work with any camera setting, even under low light.Wifi might be on the weak side---When compared with many other devices, the indicated strength of the wifi connection was low. I did not suffer drop-outs, as far as I could tell (although when listening to streaming data, the buffer may have covered the problem). Often the web browser would seem to pause during display of web pages, so I have a suspicion that a wifi dropout might have been the culprit.If you don't really care about the quality of the camera, and you don't notice any problems with wifi, then this phone is a pretty amazing deal.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00B7NAFI6', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00B7NAFI6', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00EUZRWV6</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00EUZRWV6</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

It does its job. Like many people mentioned, the part of the mount that plugs into the cigarette lighter is not very secure. There are definitely some angles where the phone won't stay still b/c the part going into the lighter socket is just not tight enough. Car sockets are really not designed to hold heavy objects secure, so there is not much that could've been done about that. You have to angle the phone in a way so that the socket part won't turn by itself. No matter how you try it though, the whole mount feels unsecured and flimsy when driving.The quality of the parts feel cheap and feel like the parts will break apart when you are adjusting the arm. I've managed to easily break(unscrew) the chrome looking cover over the USB charger. For such price you can't expect solid materials anyway.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004J75YLU" id="B004J75YLU-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-23:</strong> In fact, after using it just a few times, I am doing just that.

Even when I contacted Otterbox directly, they told me the best I can do is buy it and try it. I can now confidently say it does beautifully.Like all Otterbox cases, it does slightly increase the weight of the phone along with the overall size of the phone. Like I've told many people, your sleek, sexy phone doesn't look all that great when it shatters as it hits the ground unprotected. My big clunker though, survives every drop unharmed.I've had it on my phone for about two weeks now and have only minor complaints.Firstly, the exposed front facing camera hole can collect lint/dust pretty quickly. Same can be said about the speaker and camera/flash holes on the back.Secondly, the built in screen proctector does not sit completely flat against my screen. It's just slightly off of the screen so I have to push just a little harder to make sure the screen recognizes my touches. I don't know if it's because I have a defective product, or because the HTC One X+ varies every so slightly in dimensions than the HTC One X for which this case was actually made for.For the curious, the slight vary in dimensions is roughly 1/100th of an inch.Neither complaint is much a problem for me though, so I don't mind. The actual ability to protect the phone is what I'm most concerned about and this case does just that.This case is well worth the cost. I've never had a smart phone without it and can personally say that it has saved my phones on countless occasions.I highly recommend this product.*********UPDATE 9/25/13**********Well, almost 8 months and my otterbox is starting to give in. A couple of months ago, the flap over the charging port came off after so much use. The outer skin is now extremely loose on one side of the otterbox. The power button on the otterbox skin is now starting to loosen and tear making it harder and harder to power on/off my phone or to wake it up.Disappointed that the cover didn't even last a year. I like to think I'm not that rough on my phone.It has protected my phone on the few falls it had, so I will be getting another one....was just hoping at the price it's sold for, that it would last longer...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007R2SD26" id="B007R2SD26-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-24:</strong> It's a great product.

I don't mind that though.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B007R2SD26', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B007R2SD26', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B004DM2R48</h2>    <p class="price"> $B004DM2R48</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

As they say, you get what you pay for. It looks exactly like the photo and does what it advertises, which is to make your iPhone look like a cassette tape. It looks great, but don't plan on this offering any bump or drop protection whatsoever. The material is flimsy and feels very thin in the hand. The case is easy to put on and remove. It wraps loosely around the iPhone 4S and adds a border around the whole phone that is undesirable to me.  And as others have reported, there's no hole for the charger so you have to remove the case to charge. (I bought mine directly from CBUS.) The silent mode switch is partially obscured by the hole because it is not completely aligned.All in all, OK for $4 for the novelty value and laughs. I wouldn't recommend this as your regular day to day skin because of how thin the skin is. I'm afraid of putting it down because the camera is exposed on the back and the skin does not raise the iPhone off the surface.UPDATE: I've now been using this for a month hassle-free. I occasionally put the phone in my pocket, but worry about lint and scratches. For that, I put my iPhone inside aCase Logic TBC-302 Ultra Compact Camera Case with Storage (Black).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004DM2R48" id="B004DM2R48-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-11:</strong> It's great I use it everyday and I love the idea.

First off, the fitment is off.  There is a slight gap in the top middle of the phone where the gap is big enough to put one's fingernail inside.  This is obviously not good as dust and other contaminants can get inside easily.2nd, the color isn't really baby pink.  It's more like light coral pink with some orange tint in it.  Under certain lighting conditions and angles, the backcover can appear to be light baby pink at times.

And I had only used 2 day shipping. I ordered the purple and green. I've only used the purple so far and it's amazing. Snaps on perfectly, is light weight and doesn't add bulk. The perfect way to jazz up my galaxy without a bulky case. Still has access to the pen and doesn't cover any buttons, it's just like the original back plate only purple. Only thing is if you plan on using a case over top (I got a clear one to protect my screen from falls) the case won't fit. It's a little smaller than the original back plate so the case wobbles and comes off. So I took it off and just show off the pretty plate as is. With this and a screen protector it should be fine, I'm not worried about dropping my phone or anything.

These adapters are very flimsy and do not securely hold your micro SIM card. If your phone has a slot that the SIM card goes into (where you can't actually see the pins on the phone that will connect to the SIM card), then this item will most likely damage your phone. I tried using it on an old prepaid phone and not only did the micro SIM card slip out of the holder but then the holder became stuck inside the phone because the phone pins got snagged on the small circular opening on the adapter (you can see the circle in the pictures). When I went to remove the adapter it ended up bending the pin inside the phone which prevented any SIM card from being inserted. I ended up having to take the whole phone apart and bend the pin back into place.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005EVTZRO" id="B005EVTZRO-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-26:</strong> It was expensive for what it is, but I needed it ASAP so I could use my old phone with a full-sized SIM slot with my micro-SIM card from my new phone that broke.  I was waiting on a replacement phone and needed something to work.  This product annoys me how it has "iPhone" in the title because it's for literally thousands of phones.  This adapter will work with any phone, with any carrier at all.  The only requirement for this to work with your phone, is that it has a full size SIM tray that needs to fit a micro-SIM card.Phones with a tray that slides out take a full-sized sim, phones that you pop it in and out like an SD card take micro SIM.  At least this seems like a proper generalization to me. So as long as you have a tray in the phone you want to work, with a sim that is meant to be inserted into a phone, this adapter is for you, despite if you have an iPhone or not.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005EVTZRO" id="B005EVTZRO-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-31:</strong> What more can I say?

The Body Glove is much better than the silicone cover I had.  Better protection, better look and feel, and less "sticky" so it slips out of your pocket or holster more easily.Although the case is great, the belt clip is pretty useless.  It's hard to release the phone from the clip and the screen faces out, so if you bump into something, the glass screen is the first thing to hit.  The knob that fits in the clip is removable and can be replaced with a flush mount plug, so I replaced it.  I either keep my Galaxy in my pocket or in a Droid X holster, which, since the Droid is larger, is just the right size for my Galaxy with the Body Glove.Highly recommended.Follow up:  After several months, the rubberized skin peeled off from taking it in and out of the holster.

This case of course came far before, relatively speaking, the case for my Nexus. But, the quality is already there. The biggest problem, however, is that the tight grasp with which this case grips the phone, also makes installing and removing the phone problematic. I am almost questioning if this is for only a very, very specific model of the Galaxy S (as in the Galaxy S, of the S 4G, or the Galaxy S 4G Vibrant). This matters because there is a variation in the bezel of these models. The original Galaxy S has a somewhat larger bezel which is coated with a chrome finish. whereas the Vibrant is a somewhat thinner bezel and the front facing camera is there making the location of or spots that the case covers important. Other than the confusing product line, that product is decent, and great for the cost.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004RSQCUS" id="B004RSQCUS-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-31:</strong> its cheap , not impressed. if the phone falls I am pretty sure case will not protect the phone. you get what you pay . not recommended. save your money</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004RSQCUS" id="B004RSQCUS-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-07:</strong> Not bad at all.

Oh well.....</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009AN9JU0" id="B009AN9JU0-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-14:</strong> In the 3 days after receiving this product and installing, I ended up having to remove and reattach this case a few times to change the microUSB card, plug it in to a connector that didn't work well with the case, and to insert a small piece of metal so I could use a magnet to mount this thing.That's when the polycarbonate (yes, the hard stuff that's supposed to really protect your $400 phone) decided that one of the corners was too heavy and simply broke off.  Now mind you you're not really supposed to remove the case, apparently ever, but I would think 3 gentle removals and replacements wouldn't destroy this thing.Otherwise, I've just been using the silicone case that was left and it works great!  It's snug, doesn't compete with any connectors or anything... and it protects just fine.  I've dropped this thing countless times and no damage.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009AN9JU0" id="B009AN9JU0-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-20:</strong> I just got my ultra and its very nice. The fit is great and it is very easy to put on. I have an edge to edge screen protector and it didn't lift up when putting the case on. It's is almost exactly half as thick as the otter box defender I had on before and while there is not as much of a lip around the screen as the defender it is still large enough to keep the screen off a surface if placed face down. The pc and tpu fit together really well, it's basically 1 piece and nearly seamless. I'm not about to perform any type of drop test but the case is easy to hold and not nearly as slick as the plastic on the otter box. It looks great with the white s3, adds very little bulk to the phone but protects much better than most of the other minimal cases I've looked at. Overall highly recommended, plus the customer service is great!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009AN9JU0" id="B009AN9JU0-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-18:</strong> I love this case for my Galaxy S3.

I'm actually so glad that someone took the time to design a case like this!  It's quite thin, but due to the fact that it's two layers, the drop protection seems decent.I've been using the Otterbox Commuter for a couple months now, and just received this today. It's hard to say what I'll stick with as my daily driver after some time passes. I can say right this minute that this DBA case seems like what I'll roll with for awhile.I actually had the Incipio dual layer (forget the name) and of course dropped the phone twice, and damaged the corner of the case, which is why I went to the Commuter a couple months ago for better protection. My phone did fall off the fridge onto a tile floor with that Otterbox, but survived.  But the size and the desire for a change up is why I bought this DBA for my GS3.I'm starting to ramble, but the point is that I'm quite pleased with this case, as it seems to provide decent protection, while still being very thin. It feels like there isn't even a case on the phone, but due to design, it seems quite protective.Also impressed with the design, cutouts, and overall quality of the case for sure.  The only two very slight improvements I can possibly think of are: 1.) slightly higher "lip" over the screen and 2.) the cutouts around the speaker/camera/flash could be molded around each hole rater than one big cutout for all three.  (But these improvements are minor).***Edit - I also just wanted to add that this DBA case is actually quite a bit thinner than the Incipio and the Otterbox Commuter I had.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009AN9JU0" id="B009AN9JU0-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-24:</strong> So like you who is reading this review, I was reading reviews, surfing the net, trying to find the perfect case for me. Everyone has their own preferences. I wanted something thin, effectively protective (all corners covered), affordable (was trying to stay under $20-$25) and not some weird color. So after reading like 19 reviews that were rlelatively positive I chose this one. I liked the overall thinness - and overall the whole combo hard/soft type of cover appealed to me. The materials seemed pretty good and the matte finish was cool. It is a tight fitting cover but that was fine with me too. And I even dropped it maybe once about 1.5 ft off the ground and it protected the phone fine. However, there are times that you will want to open the back. I for one like the option to exchange batteries. I even take the microSD card out time to time for different reasons. My phone developed a crack right at the corner and I believe that it developed because I took the case off maybe a dozen times in the first month. Now, I thought I was being careful when I took off the case and maybe there is a more effective technique that avoids bending or something like that - but the case is a bit tight as others have called out. Last, I know for a fact that the impact on the ground had nothing to do with the corner because it didn't land anywhere near that corner, the impact occurred weeks prior to the crack developing and my explanation above makes sense. I would not purchase this one again simply due to the fact that I don't think it is flexible enough to be removed at the frequency I'm looking for....</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B009AN9JU0', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B009AN9JU0', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B009OY4X4M</h2>    <p class="price"> $B009OY4X4M</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

I used it first and tested it while carrying it around in my purse. I have a lot of junk in my purse that could easily scratch the phone or damage it in some way. It carried it around in my purse for a few days, and the phone was completely protected. Then my husband tried it while carrying it in his pocket at work. He's a forklift driver and has to do a lot of manual labor. He drops his phone more than anyone I have ever seen. It's always falling out of his pocket. The case had no problem protecting his phone despite him dropping it twice on concrete. There was no damage to the screen or any dents in the phone. We haven't had any trouble with the built in screen. It responds just like having a traditional screen protector. We also didn't notice any difference in call quality or have trouble hearing. Also, people we called never complained about not being able to hear us. For the price of this case, it really seems to protect just as good as other more expensive brands that I've had.I received this product free for my honest review.

The rubber on the back of this Defender series 5s is very firm and has a nice grip. Not that it would matter anyway because it's safe against drops. I also have to say it is  pleasing as well, some people like their phones or cases to be blinged out but for me this doesn't take away from the looks of the phone at all.

I don't need this part, and probably never will. It's just one of those things I want to have. Anything that goes with my Samsung Galaxy Tab, I have to have. Not because I need it. But because I'm a completeist.Plugging it in, the tablet automatically recognizes it, and I get filled with excitement as I realize I've just unlocked another very powerful feature of my tablet that I would NEVER HAVE KNOWN ABOUT had it not been for finding this on accident. Why don't they ship one of these with the tablet? Incredibly useful!  I plugged in a flash drive to it, and was able to access content with no question. Just a slick little simple device that expands the capability of your tablet a hundred fold. Do you have a Samsung Galaxy Tab 2? Well then you need one of these. Absolutely, positively and without a doubt, you must get one of these. And for the price? Get two.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008THNXMI" id="B008THNXMI-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-12:</strong> I wanted to be able to use a usb memory stick (flash drive) with my Galaxy Tab 2 7&#34;.  This adaptor was inexpensive and had good reviews so I ordered it.  It took a couple weeks to arrive (shipped from China).  I plugged  a flash drive into dongle and plugged the dongle into the Tab.  The Tab recognized the flash drive and displayed all the files on the drive.  I clicked on a video and an mp3 file and they both played fine.  Great product which really increases the ease of use of the Tab.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008THNXMI" id="B008THNXMI-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-27:</strong> I wanted this to work!

I've had no issues with it cracking or snapping like some have reported.So far, my only complaint is the orientation of the 30-pin connector. There's no marker on it to tell you which end is up and that can create confusion as it's a tight fitting connection (also good as it doesn't fall out). That's the ONLY reason for 4 stars and not 5. But it's so minor of an issue!I fixed that by scratching into the plastic housing which end was up so it makes it easier to plug and go.All in all, I've very satisfied and happy with my purchase.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008THNXMI" id="B008THNXMI-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-14:</strong> I purchased the 7&#34; samsung tablet protector with the USB keyboard.

Now that we've been home and are using our phones daily, I can say that we really like them. They're easy to clean and stay glossy looking and they don't interfere with the touch capability at all. After several days I see no scratches or swirls and finger prints wipe off easily.

I am used to the thin plastic ones, but they seem to show a lot of finger oil and smudges.  This is the first glass screen protector I have used and I am loving it.  It isn't all that resistant to smudges and finger prints but it does a better job than the plastic ones.  It feels great to the touch  and fits great on the S5.  i messed up the first one because I didn't notice the screen protector removal tool inside of the cleaning cloth.  I contacted Luvvitt and they sent me a new screen protector very quickly.  One of the best customer service experiences I have ever had.  I will definitely buy from this company again.

Great screen protector, worth the price!Be sure to use the hot shower/masking tape technique to line it up fast and lint-free. I did have a little trouble getting it to stick in the area just below my home button but after a few minutes out of the bathroom I got it to stick there.

I will never go back to the flimsy protectors that you have to struggle with dust particles and air bubbles. This is the easiest protector I have ever used. I steamed up the bathroom and then applied the protector in 10 seconds. Not one air bubble to worry about. Almost like magic the adhesive spread and instantly sealed onto my screen. Except for the slight rim that goes around the entire phone you wouldn't even know it was on. There is no drag.

When it came in, nice packaging and it came with some extra cleaning wipes but the screen cover itself is just as thick as less expensive ones. Also I took my phone to a Verizon store to have someone else put it on because I consistently get several bubbles when I do it. They read the directions and did everything per direction and somehow there was still a little piece of dirt that caused a bubble and because of how the screen protector is, they couldn't take it off and redo it. I bought a less expensive screen protector for my son's phone and I think I will end up buying it for mine in a few months. For the price I was kind of disappointed -- this screen protector cost more than the LUVVIT cover I bought.UPDATE: I'm not sure how it happened but my screen cracked on my phone. I don't remember dropping it but I did put it in my back pocket and sit down several times. This is a good product for scratches, dust, fingerprints, and such but is not as durable/protective as I thought it would be.UPDATE OF THE UPDATE: I found out after my update post that someone borrowed my phone and they dropped it but didn't noticed the cracks.  I had to take my phone to Verizon to get a rebuilt phone because it was going to cost me more to replace the screen.  Turned out the phone screen was fine, only this screen protector cracked. I ordered a new screen protector and currently have a plastic one for now. I can definitely tell the difference between the two. I'm not only giving back the star I took away but adding two because this screen saved me over $200.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IKRHCCY" id="B00IKRHCCY-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-11:</strong> This is awesome and fits perfectly!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IKRHCCY" id="B00IKRHCCY-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-13:</strong> Love this protector it is crystal clear, bubble and dust free.

The screen is crystal clear and protected. The durability is unknown but any glass breaks if it is stressed out.The edges are very smooth and the size is perfect. Some can argue that size is 1 mm less at the surrounding. This is necessary to avoid hitting the surrounding border.The installation was very easy. I am able to install without dust in a steamed bathroom.The price is obviously best. I got it for under 10 and it cant be bet by spigen.

The screen with this glass or without is very slippery. This problem exist even if this glass is not installed.

It looks really nice and does not show fingerprints like the plastic did.  My one small complaint is that a small air bubble developed on one corner of the screen, even though I believe I thoroughly cleaned it.  I can see nothing under it, but this one edge shows an air bubble under the right light.  It does not seem to affect the operation.  The rest of the glass sealed exactly as shown in the installation instructions.  Quite unlike the plastic films and water I have dealt with in the past.  This is the way to go.  I am chalking the bubble up to a possible fault on my part and may try a reinstall.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IKRHCCY" id="B00IKRHCCY-review23" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-25:</strong> I've tried plastic covers for my phones - they go to pot very quickly, never feel as good as the glass itself, and don't seem to protect all that well either.  They scuff too easily and you have to replace them too much.Enter the tempered glass protector.  I've searched around and for the money, this is the deal to beat.  The glass covering feels JUST like the phone and if anything is more oleophobic (harder to leave finger prints).  It's also THICK!  It actually stands proud of the S5 button just slightly.  Thankfully it's not so thick that it comes up past my case.  It really feels like it's going to protect the glass.You MUST clean your phone very and apply this in near-dust free conditions.  If you have static electricity buildup, you will have a bad time.  Both the adhesive and your phone will draw dust.  You may even want to do it in a humid room (bathroom after a shower) and perhaps a grounding strap - to make sure the dust is damped.Even under fantastic conditions I got two tiny spots (thankfully at the very edge of the protector) from dust.  You have to look close to see them, but understand that application is unforgiving.  Once on, the screen is absolutely crystal clear and you can't tell it's on.Some may not like that the center button is no longer proud of the screen - so keep that in mind as well.  Definitely high marks for this one.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IKRHCCY" id="B00IKRHCCY-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-14:</strong> No seriously.

This case was honestly purchased to get my order over the $25 for free shipping. I was pleased when I received this case. The build quality is a bit better than the other case and the more I use it the more I like the vertical flip as opposed to the book style of the Poetic.I find the vertical flip much easier to use one handed. I can use my index finger to press the clasp off of the top of the phone then just let the case fall open. To close I simply flip the cover back up and press it closed with my thumb. I could sort of open the Poetic with one hand and some finger acrobatics but I was always worried that I would drop the phone.This case is also slightly thinner than the Poetic which is nice when in my pocket. I have a feeling I will be using this case a lot as the weather gets warmer and I will be carrying my phone in my pocket instead of my evest. This case will protect my screen while in my pocket as a bumper or TPU case will not.It's a great case for a great price!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AE3TZCW" id="B00AE3TZCW-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-18:</strong> Items works well with nexus phone, I didn't other colors at the time except black, pink, brown, girl colors but the feel and fit are good.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AE3TZCW" id="B00AE3TZCW-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-18:</strong> I got this case three days ago and I like it in general. It fits my nexus 4 very well although I had to manually adjust the corners to make them snugly fit. The cuts of camera and speaker are accurate. It feels very comfortable holding the phone with the case on. However the area of the coverage on the power adapter end could be a little larger to make the case less wobbling when open. Also the picture showing the product as a vertical stand is ridiculous - the phone is upside down standing like that (screen cannot rotate upside down) and no one can use it in that position. So the picture and associated description of using the case as a vertical stand should be removed.Update (2/12/2013): Now it has been a few weeks since I had received this case, and between then and now I have also purchased a bumper case, a tough armor case, and a slim case (yes I am obsessed with cases). I have to say this flip case is my favorite and I have been using it every day (have to put away the other cases). Therefore I am changing my rating from 4 stars to 5 stars, despite the cons I mentioned in my earlier review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AE3TZCW" id="B00AE3TZCW-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-07:</strong> 4.5 stars  This case is one of the most minimal flip cases I've used.  If you are looking for a flip case that adds very little bulk to your Nexus 4 well this is it.  The top of the case covering the front of the phone has a nice plush padded feel.  It is padded and you can feel it.  The back is very rigid.  Overall the fit and finish is very nice. Although the cut outs for the speaker and camera/flash are not correctly centered I only took off 1/2 a star because they do not impair their function.  At a cost of $7.95 this case is well worth the money.  Presently there are only a couple of vertical flip covers for the Nexus 4. This one is by far the most premium.I do wish the makers of these cases would incorporate a couple of slots for an ID and credit card.  It's always good to have extra functionality.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AE3TZCW" id="B00AE3TZCW-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-28:</strong> Worked well for 2 months.

It closes fine.  You add a slight thickness to the edge of the phone with a case on it, so basically it closes all the way, almost exactly the same as without a case, but because of the case, you won't hear the phone cover "click shut" but it is closed and its not like the front is suddenly lose or pops open.

Five stars based on my expectations and intended use.As a charger, it works pretty well.  It will charge a device from zero to 100%.  My daughter's Samsung Appeal phone and my kindle touch got full charges.  After that, it didn't have enough juice to charge anything else.  But it was able to run the light for 8 hours.......which brings me to the flashlight portion of the device.  Basically, giant battery and itsy-bitsy light.  It's no Streamlight or even Maglite, but it'll get you where you're going in the dark.  And the flashlight button is a tiny plastic dot that must be held for a second to turn it on or off.  It is also a bit longer than the case, so the light can't be stood upright very well if you wanted to have it just shine up and light the room.  There is just one brightness setting.  So don't expect a whole lot from the flashlight.The only thing I would suggest to the builder is to rethink the flashlight control.  Do away with the little button and instead use a twisting mechanism near the lens to turn it on & off.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BJEM9X2" id="B00BJEM9X2-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-14:</strong> works well. holds charge. the light is bright. cables attach without connection issues. great for the price . would purchase again. arrived very quickly</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BJEM9X2" id="B00BJEM9X2-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-12:</strong> This is exactly what I was looking for.

Even using my iPad 3rd gen charger, capable of charging at a 2.1A rate, the current draw was only 0.73A.

If true, and if one goes by the advertised mAH rating of 2800, then at 0.73A charge, full charge takes 3.8 hours.Still a good price, and great for an emergency.  Just wish it had more mAH output and charged faster.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BJEM9X2" id="B00BJEM9X2-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-28:</strong> Compact and awesome.

The part numbers are identical but the weight is listed as 80 g instead of 87 g.  Instead of the set of 4 blue lights to show charge level, now there is just a single red/blue indicator.  And now the flashlight cycles through high power / low power / strobe / and then OFF with each short press on the button.  So it now appears to work more like those sold by Swift Gear.  Two stars off for going to the cruder power indicator.  It also is now always live at the output - as soon as you plug in a device it starts charging and the indicator works only during charging.  So, does it still have a charge or not - no way of telling.So actually 5 stars if you have the old version, 3 stars for the new version.  Adding a strobe light does not compensate for the poor indicators in the new version.The newer version recharges at .75 amp if your USB port can supply that much.  It will provide up to 1.0 amp.  Holds charge well so far.  Has no problem charging low power devices like MP3 players to 100%.  It charges my Kindle keyboard at the full .85A current while maintaining the voltage at 4.97V, a very good result.You can buy an inexpensive 7/8" cap at your local hardware that will protect the contacts and switch from dirt and false switch presses.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BJEM9X2" id="B00BJEM9X2-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-06:</strong> I bought this for my co-worker whose favorite color is pink.

That makes this completely useless as a backup.Although the shape and color are nice, it's actually quite large and heavy.

Electrically, there are several features I like about this KMASHI unit:- It has a 4-LED battery status indicator (instead of just one LED for other units)- It has auto-on/off feature: The unit powers up automatically after you connect a load to its USB device. It powers off in about 6 seconds if no load is detected.- The standby current is very low at just 0.3mA according to the back of the box. That means it can have a shelf life of up to 1 year.- It advertises higher capacity of '2800mAh' vs. 2600mAH for other products.Upon closer examination, however, I discovered several minor problems with the KMASHI unit:1. The measured capacity is lower.When using a 5-ohm power resistor as load, the unit is able to deliver 0.94A at 4.9V, or 4.6W of power for 87 minutes. This gives a total output energy of 6.67Wh. According to my calculation, the internal battery has a capacity of 2250mAh, or just 80% of advertised value. In contrast, the KickBot and Swift Gear units' internal batteries were measured at around 2500-2600mAh (All capacities are estimated assuming 80% conversion efficiency). See the chart I uploaded to 'Customer Images' section for runtime comparision.2. The battery status indicator is highly non-linear.According to the instruction sheet, each of the 4 LEDs should represent 25% of charge. My actual observations were very different:- 4 LED = 90 to 100%- 3 LED = 71 to 89%- 2 LED = 51 to 70%- 1 LED = 15 to 50%- 1 blinking LED = under 15%3. The LED flashlight is relatively weak when compared to other units. Its beam has roughly the same brightness as that of an old-fashioned 2xAA penlight. The up-side is that it has a much longer runtime. The instruction sheet claims 72 hours, compared to just 10-20 hours I estimated for other two units.(Note: you have to press and hold the power button for 3 seconds to turn on/off the flashlight)Overall, this is still a good power bank unit to consider - if you can get it at a lower price than other similar products. I would have given it a 5-star rating if its capacity rating were more accurate.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BJEM9X2" id="B00BJEM9X2-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-18:</strong> Now I have to buy 3 more for my wife and 2 daughters.

Problem was, I couldn't get my wife's S4 to connect. So I tried the MPOW based upon the good reviews.My experience: I was able to make a bluetooth connection to both my phones (HTC and Samsung) but it would be hit or miss (mostly miss) on subsequent attempts. Press the button, bluetooth says connecting (for a long time!) and then either an error "no media" or just simply not connecting.With that experience, I wrote a review giving it 1 star and threw both of these devices in the junk drawer. I've been connecting via wire ever since. Sounds better than bluetooth anyway, I figured. But hooking up a wire every time does get old. So when this company read my review they offered to send a new device. OK. Very cool!!So the new device came and boy did it seem powerful. Lots of pop and buzz and engine noise in my stereo. Wow, I am no electronic expert but that is a shielding problem of some sort? Anyway, it did connect to both phones but I had to keep the volume low, low, low to avoid the buzzing. Not good.But since they were so cool I wanted to give it a full trial. I took the day off and then went out again to try my devices one by one (in case the buzz was some sort of cross interference since I had all 3 with me in the car that first time). Well, no buzz today; that's good. Unfortunately, I can't change my original review.Results are as follows:(1) HTC Car A200 connects every time. Even to my wife's Samsung S4. (Must have been some software update?) Push the activate button and tada, music thru the car system.(2) The original MPOW connected once, so I got out of the car and walked away to come back and try it again. This second time I got no connection. Going into bluetooth setting on the phone I pushed Link-CZBT03 and got the "no media" error message. No further connections made.(3) And lastly, the new MPOW was a failure. It wasn't buzzing and going pop like it was going to blow up my amp, so that was good, but it didn't connect even once. Going into phone settings just gave me a grey "connecting" - that lasted a long time - and then came back white without ever connecting.I see some people are 5 stars with a feeling that they purchased a good, easy to connect device, while others, like me, have buzz in their stereo, connection problems, etc. It's cheap enough that you may want to try it? Just be prepared to get a refund because there are quite a few of us with a negative experience.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008AGQMQC" id="B008AGQMQC-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-04:</strong> This unit is very small and very inexpensive. I was not sure what to expect. The unit arrived and worked fine. However, I had a small complaint and I intended to contact Amazon. But guess what! The seller (Patuoxun) contacted me to see if I was happy. I sent an email describing my problem and and new unit was on its way immediately. I can't believe what good customer service for a relatively inexpensive product. I would have no problem buying from this supplier in the future. And the product does what it says it does. I like how small it is and the fact that I will have NO wires to mess with. It plugs right into the radio.

We have had Sirius XM radio for years going thorough that exact same port. The quality of the audio was ok at best. Due to the fact that Sirius plays the same songs over and over and the comedy channels we liked are full of ads, we discontinued it and decided to use our phones.I was expecting the quality to be very similar since I was using the same jack. It was not. This works great. If you have your speaker set too high though and your bluetooth audio is not set at full, you will hear some hiss in the background. So if you have any issues, check the output of your device first.The one thing it does not do, that I was hoping, is automatically connect when I start up the car. I have it always plugged in via the micro usb cable provided and was hoping that when I turn on the engine, this would turn on and therefore connect to my phone. It does not. I have to hold the power button till it turns on and connects each time. Perhaps when the battery on it deteriorates, it will always turn on when the power turns on from the engine and then it will work that way. That is what kept this from getting 5 stars.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008AGQMQC" id="B008AGQMQC-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-24:</strong> The customer service backing this product is amazing!I received a product that did not charge in my car, the company refunded my cost and sent me a new unit to ensure I was happy.The unit connects easily to all my BlueTooth devices and there is no lost in sound quality versus my AUX cable.The only reason I went with 4 of 5 stars is the plastic is a little thin and I feel the unit could be a little more rugged.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008AGQMQC" id="B008AGQMQC-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-11:</strong> Updated.

So they sent me a replacement.  Same thing happens.  I again explained to support my issue and was again advised to be sure to turn the blue tooth on when attempting to connect to their blue tooth device.

This little wonder is amazing.  Yes, its a bit delicate and i would suggest using one of your old ear-bud holders lying around to keep this little wonder in when not is use, but man the 3.0 connection and the versatility is off the charts.  Easy to pair, has track up, down and pause play button on the unit.  I haven't tested the battery life yet, but paired both my galaxy S4 and my girlfriends Iphone 4 AT THE SAME TIME!  So if i played a song and hit pause, she could then hit play (seems like IOS trumped android in my limited testing)  But seriously, how cool to have both phones paired at same time to switch back and forth while listening in the car, or at home, or wherever. Very impressed with the tiny footprint and the amazing clarity of the wireless signal.  Well done.  I just ordered another one for the travel bag (leaving the first in the car).  For under $20, to have wireless sound in any speaker or system that has a stereo mini aux jack is actually priceless.

I just moved to the NY-Long Island area from western PA, and I sometimes have long drives back and forth.  In addition, this lets me make/take calls virtually hands free.  I say virtually because you still have to hit some buttons to use the voice activation as you normally do with most phones/headsets/etc.  I haven't any issues with someone not hearing me as of yet, but I normally put up the windows so I can hear better.  Also did notice as others had said that I needed to turn the radio up a bit to hear the person I had on the phone, however they don't seem to have a problem hearing me.  Overall, I bought this more for the ease of streaming music, and so far it has done that job very well.  Another great feature this device has that I haven't seen on many devices is that with an iphone, it will display the mPow's battery level.  This is a great feature that I've only heard about bluetooth headsets having.Update: I wish I could find the other reviews on this as well, but I discovered the device apparently has separate volumes for music and calls.  I was turning my radio way up to hear people on calls and then getting blasted when hanging up and returning to music.  If you use the volume buttons on the device while on a call, you can adjust it up instead of using the car stereo volume.  This enabled me to max both out on the device and just use the car manual volume to adjust accordingly and both were much closer and not getting blasted after hanging up.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008AGQMQC" id="B008AGQMQC-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-19:</strong> Good little device that works like it should.

I was in for a surprise!Plugged into the AUX port on my '07 Honda Civic, once paired with my IPhone and the radio turned to AUX, it actually works! When the phone signals an incoming call while I am playing music, the music stops and, through one of the smarter features in a smart phone, the phone function takes over.  The receiver then resumes streaming the music from the phone to the speakers a few seconds after the phone call ends.To be clear: These are retrofit devices.  Most new cars do not need them because the Bluetooth function is built-in. For those of us driving cars old enough to not have that feature and just new enough to come equipped with an AUX plug port - this little device is perfect. It takes about an hour to charge and will play for nearly 5 hours between recharges. I recharge mine via a USB cable while driving!For under $20. this is a VERY nicely made retrofit device.Being an imperfect world with imperfect people and devices, I would be remiss in not mentioning that as a phone microphone, it is useless. No one will hear you - But, as a Bluetooth music player, it is wonderfully good at this price point.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008AGQMQC" id="B008AGQMQC-review23" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-27:</strong> Cheap, and it works, plug is removable and will accept any standard 3.5mm stereo audio cable.Bluetooth phone calls in my car are not the best, but my car is really noisy so that's probably not it's fault.Sound quality for podcasts and music is great.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008AGQMQC" id="B008AGQMQC-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-30:</strong> See my review of the  2013 New Version!!

I'm using this to stream music from my iphone 5 to my car's stereo. My car has a 3.5mm auxilliary jack and I currently use a long cord to connect the phone to the stereo. It's cumbersome and the wire always gets in the way.Here's what the EDUP does well: (1) Easy to pair with my iphone 5 (just push the button for about 7 seconds until the lights flash and it's done). (2) Easy to turn on (just hold the button for about 3 seconds until the light flashes and the audio indicator plays over the car's speakers to let you know it's on). (3) Easy to turn off (just push the button for about 5 seconds until the light flashes and the audio tone tells you it's off). (4) Sounds just as good as plugging my phone directly into the auxilliary audio port in my car. (5) Can play and charge at the same time via the 12V power outlet in my car -- I leave it plugged in all the time. (6) Falls asleep to conserve power when not used for about 20 minutes. (7) When a call comes in, I am able to turn on my bluetooth earpiece and the audio switches from the EDUP to my earpiece appropriately. (8) Comes with a short male 3.5mm to male 3.5mm jack (shown in the picture), a male 3.5mm to male 3.5 cable in case the little jack won't physically fit in your car (I prefer the cable because the auxilliary port is in the bottom of the center console of my car, which is tough to reach with all my junk in there -- the cable allows me to put the EDUP on top of the stuff in the center console which is easier to reach), and a short micro USB charging cable.Here's what could be improved: (1) While the on/off function isn't horrible, it could be easier... maybe toggle between on/off without having to count 3 or 5 seconds depending on which operation you want (seems like the device could figure out that if "I'm currently on and the user is pressing the button, the user wants to me to turn off now")... maybe separate buttons... maybe move the light indicator so it isn't directly on the button (which ends up being under the finger that is pressing the buttons). (2) I'd love it if this would automatically wake up when I turn on the car... maybe it could recognize that power from the 12V outlet is off and go to sleep and then when the power is restored, it could wake up. I realize the EDUP also runs on battery power, so this may not be technically feasible given that it will "always" have some form of power. (3) When I hang-up the bluetooth earpiece after taking a call, it would be awesome if the EDUP would resume playing music. As it is now, the music pauses when I switch over to the earpiece and I have to actually press the "play" button on the phone to get the music to resume after I hang up the earpiece. I think this is probably a function of the phone, not the EDUP, though.If the EDUP could do #1 on the things on the "to be improved" list, I would have given it 5 stars. If it could everything on my "to be improved" list, I would have given it 5 stars AND I would have been willing to pay an additional $10 or $20 for the device. Other than that, it's a great little device and does what I had hoped it would do.UPDATED: I started to get really irritated with the "hold the button for 3 seconds to turn on and 5 seconds to turn off" functionality. It seems that I could never get the hang of what 3/5 seconds felt like and it constantly took me 2 or 3 tries to get this thing to turn on/off. I purchased a different bluetooth receiver that doesn't have a battery. With the new receiver, when there's power, it's on. When there's no power, it's off. No on/off switch to deal with. I like it much better for my particular application.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008AGQMQC" id="B008AGQMQC-review29" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-01:</strong> Either I am incompetent or this thing doesn't want to pair with my headphone by, Syba.

What a waste of money, the sound on that thing was tinny and just horrible.This unit is absolutely perfect.  I have a Monster Cable iCarPlay Cassette Adapter with a Mini Jack connector that I used to plug into my Kindle or my Phone to play music in the car.  The Silver Mini Adapter you see coming out of the Mpow unit is actually removable, so the Mini Jack can plug directly into the Mpow Unit.  Additionally, the Micro USB adapter plugs into my Auto USB, charging the unit while it's in use.  Best of all, unlike some other units I've seen advertised on Amazon, there's ZERO interference if you're charging while using the unit.04/29/2014 - Update:I attached my Asus TF101 to my passenger side visor to run Music and Videos (Synced off Plex).  I forgot that my phone was also connected via bluetooth, but I was pretty surprised when I was listening to some music and the music paused because a call was coming in on my Note 2.  I took the call (which worked flawlessly with crystal clear sound) and after the call was over, the music began to play again automatically.

As others have mentioned you do have to read the directions a few times regarding how long to press the button to pair a device or power on and off, but the instructions are clear. Also, the device gives feedback by red or blue leds under the button, which you can't really see if you are pressing the button. As far as once connected the device works perfectly fine and I have yet to really have any issues using for about 10 hours. I set this up in my vehicle to be a permanent type of installation which is always plugged into the aux and a charger so I don't have to keep charging it. Only issue though is I ran into a lot of ground loop noise, which is pretty common with this type of device and can be fixed with a ground loop isolator, which I already had installed anyways.On another note, the packaging was nice and also came with a short usb cord and also a long auxillary cable which is actually thicker and better quality than some of the cheaper cables that can come bundled with these accessories.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008AGQMQC" id="B008AGQMQC-review39" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-31:</strong> This is an amazing product.

It fits my needs exactly.  It's pretty small, a lot smaller than I thought it'd be, but this makes it perfect for tossing in my purse or pocket.  For the most part, though, it spends most its time in my car.  Because this thing only has three buttons (power, volume up and down) it's pretty self explanatory, but you should keep the little leaflet of instructions just in case.  Pairing it was easy and it transmitted music from my phone to my car's speakers just as I hoped it would.  A little tip; the volume buttons don't act as such for me when using them with my phone (Moto X).  Instead of changing the volume, it skips or goes back tracks in Google Music, which is actually pretty great for me as I can easily use the volume buttons on my steering wheel instead and would prefer hard buttons to change music tracks than relying on looking at phone while driving.  Another great thing about this transmitter, that, while not exactly the prettiest one on offer, it charges up quickly, stays charged for a good while, and doesn't need to constantly plugged in to external power to run.  This adapter is great for use in cars and because of its size it stays completely out of the way until you need it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008AGQMQC" id="B008AGQMQC-review51" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-27:</strong> Works great in my car.

I expected it to connect my phone to my stereo, whatever the process (it doesn't auto connect, only remembers one phone, etc.).  So, yesterday (of course the day AFTER I am eligible to return/replace it) it stopped working.  The device is charged (I have it connected to a car charger) but it will not turn on at all.  I had this nicely situated in my car, so I am pretty irritated that it only lasted 31 days.  Stay away from this one.UPDATE.  Immediately upon posting this review, the seller contacted me offering a replacement device.  I was impressed with their desire to make things right (of course the device stopped working 31 days after purchase!).  So far the replacement is working fantastic.  I will wait and see if this one outlasts the first one, but suffice it to say that so far I'm impressed and would likely buy from this seller again.  The device is simple, but does what I need it to and does it without complication.  If this one lasts, I will chalk it up to bad luck and probably come back and up my rating even further.  Just the customer service brings it from 1 star to 3.

It arrived quickly and was easy to set up just as described. All I had to do pretty much was plug it in, turn it on, and then pair my HTC One SV. So far, so good. I am not bothered in the least by having to hold the button for 3 seconds in order to turn it on. Music sounds just as good as wired connection in my car, without noticeable interference. Battery life is respectable and it notifies me with a beeping noise before it dies to remind me to plug it in. Turns itself off automatically sometime after I leave my car but before the battery dies. Some people are saying about 20 minutes and I believe them. These are the good points of this device.My experience deviated somewhat on other points that weren't quite working for me as described. First, everytime I turn it on now, I have to go into my phone and tell it to connect. This is extremely frustrating and could possibly be related to my HTC One as much as it is this device. In my experience with bluetooth devices (Some of my work involves setting up and fixing devices that connect wirelessly), certain equipment just seems to work better than others when mated together. Sometimes one has to search to find the combination that works best. This is compounded by my bluetooth headset (Samsung HM7000) that also now doesn't want to connect by itself until it is the only device around. My phone routinely drops either this device or the headset, without notifying me, and they fight for the media audio and phone audio outputs. This never ocurred prior to the addition of the Mpow, despite concurrently having three different model bluetooth headsets. This would be somewhat easier to live with if I used the Mpow exclusively for phone conversation within the car but I have received numerous complaints about poor sound quality by the people that I am talking to. I can hear them through the car speakers but they have a hard time hearing me through the Mpow's microphone. Turning off all the fans and rolling up the windows helps but does not eliminate the problem. One touch calling or answering is dicey in my experience and works about half the time. This is not a big issue for me as it is easier to just press the voice call or answer button on my phone screen, than it is to press the button on this device. I include that simply to illustrate my contention that the description by the seller is a bit optimistic, in my opinion, as to the ease of use for phone calls. These are snags that aren't really deal-breakers for me but definitely detract from my overall user experience.To sum it up, as a wireless music receiver this thing is great and I would recommend it highly. As a hands-free device to make and receive phone calls without having to dial a number or look at the phone, this device is a nightmare and possibly deserves negative stars for the potential hazards of trying to reconnect the bluetooth stereo receiver at 65 mph in traffic on the freeway after the signal drops. As a result,  I gave it a three overall. This is not, as I stated, entirely the fault of this device as my phone plays just as big of a part. They just don't seem to &#34;like&#34; each other, which translates  to a headache for me. i am still shopping and eagerly await for the day that I can just get into my car, place my phone on the dock, put on a wireless earpiece, and have both the earpiece for the phone, and stereo for the music, connect without any intervention. If anyone is having that particular experience with their HTC, please let me know what products are working for you.

There are four clips that hold the phone firmly in place. On the left side, the clips are on the corners. On the right side, the clips are on the side. There is plenty of room to access the power button, charging port, and the "S Pen".The exterior is "Synthetic PU Leather", which feels like soft glove leather. Some people might prefer genuine leather, but you can't even tell the difference. The interior is microfiber, which fell like suede. The softness of the microfiber will protect the back and screen.Once your phone is placed inside the case, it is safely protected by the cover, which clips to the right side of the phone. On the back, the camera and flash cut out is just the right size. The case can also be used in landscape mode to view movies. This is done by adding a groove into the cover, which holds the phone at the perfect viewing angle.CONTENTS:EassyAcc Samsung Note 3 Leather Flip CaseFEATURES:Exterior: Synthetic PU LeatherInterior: MicrofiberI was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FPB9CJ4" id="B00FPB9CJ4-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-06:</strong> This is a simple yet elegant case for the Galaxy Note 3. It's made of a synthetic PU leather that's very classy looking. The phone is clipped in with 4 corner clips. The front is thickly padded, the inside is a gray microfiber material. The single opening fits well. It converts quickly into a stand with a single motion (see photos). Overall, a nice and inexpensive case. Sample was provided for review purposes.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FPB9CJ4" id="B00FPB9CJ4-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-29:</strong> I received a review sample and carefully examined this case before swapping my Note 3 into it. The fit is perfect. This case definitely holds the Note 3 firmly in place using two diagonally placed tabs to hold the left side of the phone and two that that are lined up on the right side.What makes the design so clever is the minimalist design that has maximum function. This is evidenced by the 'catch' on the outer cover flap also functions as the catch for using this case as a stand as well as a magnetic-free clasp for closing the cover. The clever design is also shown by the arrangement of the tabs that I mentioned above. The four tabs are placed in a manner as to not interfere with any button or function. It does not block the camera or flash, and you can use any size charging cable without the case interfering. That last feature is important because I own one heavy-duty USB 3.0 cable that is a tight fit when my phone is in other cases that I have tried.This case is also heavily padded. It looks beautiful, but thanks to the thinner PU synthetic leather the case is constructed with a heavy foam padding under the PU exterior that truly protects the phone. There is even a channel designed into the outer cover that strengthens that part, which provides another level or protection.The tabs and catch I mentioned are also made of the padded synthetic leather, which absorbs the shock from a fall a lit better than the harder plastic that other cases use.At the time of this review this case cost less than ten bucks, but is designed and made better than a few more expensive cases that I own for my Note 3. For function and price this is the best one I own and one that I have no problem recommending to friends.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FPB9CJ4" id="B00FPB9CJ4-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-20:</strong> This case fits my Galaxy Note 3 snugly, and with one quick motion converts into a stand that is the perfect position to view videos.The faux-leather feels good to the touch and the material inside is soft to the touch, like a microfiber cloth. Not sure how well it would protect the phone to a drop on the corner or edge, but the padding on the front and back are more than enough to protect the device when landing screen-or-back-down. The cutout on the back of the phone is large enough to not impede pictures while the case is one the phone.I am happy with this case, and I love how easy it is to stand up on a flat surface for hands free viewing of videos.The manufacturer sent me a review unit in exchange for a fair and honest review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00FPB9CJ4', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00FPB9CJ4', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00E7NWAKY</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00E7NWAKY</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

The glossy front gave it a professional look to it.The extra insert was easily removed and allowed other phones to fit in and charge as well. The dual ports became useful when I needed that extra power but not enough time to charge one battery at a time.Rubber leggings held the phone stable on my desk. The transfer rate from desktop to pc was fairly fast as well.My friend was using his Galaxy Nexus and it charged and transfered just fine as well. I expect that any phone that is less wide than the S4 and has a micro usb at the bottom will fit on this dock as well.It was great that it came with it's own usb wall charger in case I needed an extra to lose on trips. It charged my S4 quite decently fast.The positioning of the case provides a great view of the phone in case you need to check something real quick. The LED on the dock is quite nice as it indicated if the dock was functioning properly.With the price and efficiency it provides, it is worth it.Hope this helps!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E7NWAKY" id="B00E7NWAKY-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-12:</strong> Does what it is meant to do.

I spend a lot of time at my desk doing work around my computer and my phone needs to stay charged so when I leave I've got some decent battery to play candy crush with.Why is this so much different?I honestly hate fumbling around trying to get the orientation of the USB cable correct and trying to figure out where my cord is. Call me lazy, but I hate it. This cradle is a godsend because I can simply toss my phone on the cradle, not worrying about anything and it's plugged in.I don't use a case with my gs4 so I can't comment about whether or not it works with a case however there is some extra space so I can't imagine that it wouldn't fit.The super awesome thing about this is that if you decide you don't like the cradle, you can simply get rid of it and you still have yourself a simple wall charger. That's innovating!Basically, this is a great accessory for someone who doesn't like fumbling around with a cable. Just drop your phone into the cradle and you're ready to go.Oh and I forgot to say this, it has a spot on the back to charge your extra battery!!!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E7NWAKY" id="B00E7NWAKY-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-02:</strong> I have not used it that much.

I have an S4 with the wireless charger battery door plus I have a case on it. After removing the insert the phone did fit perfectly. A pleasant surprise! Now I don't have to take of the case every time like I had feared. Battery slot charger works fine, too. It does not charge my battery to 100%, but I tried another battery charger and that charged it even less. So maybe it is the battery. Only on suggestion: It would be great if the design could be changed so the charger can also be used as a stand in landscape view.

I expected it to work and the phone to fit but that was about it. Keep in mind I tossed the charger and USB cable that came with this charger in a drawer. I'm using the (Amazon Kindle Fire 5ft USB to Micro-USB Cable) connected to a (Samsung OEM 2.0 Amp Travel Charger). Here are my Pros and Cons....Pros:1. The plastic has a nice soft silky feel to it. The base is the perfect weight and size that I feel comfortable it won't fall over.2. The battery compartment fit is right on using the OEM Samsung battery as well as a RAVPower spare I had on hand. The fit, with or without an insert (I'm using a Samsung Protective Bumper Cover Plus Case for Galaxy S4), is close while still leaving a little wiggle room.3. Rubber feet/tabs do a good job of keeping the base from moving on a slippery nightstand.Cons:1. Worst is the blue light on the front. This is a very common problem with electronics these days. Companies don't stop to think whether a power light is necessary on their products. I would say a large number of these products are on their owners nightstands. Why would we want a light shining in our eyes while we're trying to sleep? If this light had a reason to be on the charger this might forgive it but it lights blue when plugged into a power source. That's its entire function. It doesn't change color when your phone is charging or when it completes it's charge. Why can't it flash three times when plugged in then go out? Or be smaller and located on the back of the unit? I ended up covering this up with some folded paper and masking tape.2. Second issue is minor and not really fair but I'll mention it anyway. I wish this had an audio out. I'm not rating this lower for this but I'll list it as a con because this unit should include this feature. Even if they charge $2 or $3 extra bucks this would have put this charger at a solid 5 star rating. Feel free to disagree with me on this one.Conclusion: Overall I'm very happy with this charger, despite my long rant about the power light! lol. I would have knocked off 1/2 star for the the power light but being as it's an easy fix and 4 1/2 stars isn't allowed I rounded up. No matter how I looked at it, it was definitely worth the $19.99 I paid. I've been using this for 10 days now. If I experience any problems I will update this review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E7NWAKY" id="B00E7NWAKY-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-22:</strong> I have a GS$ and it fit just right in the cradle but I couldn't put the phone in the with the case. works fine and chargers my 2nd battery well.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E7NWAKY" id="B00E7NWAKY-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-16:</strong> I got it just in time for a trip, thinking I would be able to charge my new S4 and extra battery at night.

I do not like to write a review until I have tested the product longer.  When I received the product, I was amazed on how well the product was constructed.  The cradle was made with quality plastic that was quite thick, strong, and heavy.  It felt very sturdy.  The product had good fitting for both the cradle and the spare battery charger in the back.  I will write about both functionality.  Also I was surprised that this product came with a USB cord and the plug for an outlet.  In the past when I bought some cradle chargers, some company do not give you the extra cable and charger, and expect you to use the one that came with your phone.  This way you have a spare to use.The Samsung S4 fit perfectly in the cradle, there was no gap and the phone laid perfectly in the slot.  The charging capability of the charger was as good as the original charger.  The only issue I have is that I have a hard back case which is not as easy to remove to charge.  As this cradle is perfect fit for s S4 with no protective cover.  If you have no cover or an easy to remove soft cover then this would work well for you.As for the rear spare battery charger, that was good.  I have an extra spare battery that I use the charger to charge and be ready at all times.  The battery fit perfectly.  It is an actual slot that the battery fit perfectly in.  It is unlike other battery chargers where the pins are flimsy.  The charging pins are not exposed, so as long as you push the battery in, it is in place.  The only issue some might have, is that this charger is quite slow, it is more of a trickle charge, so do not expect it to charge as fast as the cradle portion.  I am ok with that, as I have always heard that slow charging is better for the battery.  Overall this product is great and I would trust the products of this company.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E7NWAKY" id="B00E7NWAKY-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-25:</strong> Just received this product in the mail and ,the quality of it is really great !

Almost every day I attend college from 8AM to 3:30PM, and right after I work from 4PM to 12PM. Both school and work involves me using my phone. Whether it's contacting clients or researching information for classroom discussions, let's just say my Galaxy S4 is always under heavy usage. Even though the S4 has a much improved battery life than the previous models, it is still no where near perfect to run an entire day on one charge. I was lucky enough to be contacted by RAVPower to try this product. When I realized this product would enable me to charge my device and a spare batery, I was very excited because this would solve my battery issues for long days. Due to my previous positive experiences with their products, I decided to try this one out without any hesitation.Within two days the product was at my doorstep. The charging dock came packaged very nicely in a box. Once I took the product out of the box, I was very impressed by the overall build and quality. For the price point, the design and attention to detail really caught my attention. The front part of the docking system has a beautiful glossy finish to match your S4's body, whereas the sides of the product has a matte finish, complementing the S4's brushed steel look. The back of the charging system has a little insert to charge a spare battery. Now, it has a little LED light to show if the battery is charging. When the LED light is glowing red, it indicates that the battery is charging. Once the charging is complete, the LED light switches from RED to GREEN. The charging time for the docking system is extremely fast, within about an hour I can charge my phone completely. The charging time for the spare battery isn't as fast, it takes about 1 hour and 40ish minutes to charge the battery completely, which isn't bad at all.For the price point, RAVpower is enabling customers of Amazon to get a gorgeous charging dock for a very low price. The quality and performance of the product does not make sense for the price point. If you are someone such as me with a busy schedule or if you are just someone who likes to put their phone under heavy usage, this is a great product for you because it will always enable you to have a spare fully charged battery, no matter where you are.RAVPower has an amazing customer service team. I've never had any problems with their products but they have always taken their time to respond to any questions I have ever had in order to make sure that I was fully content. I highly recommend this product, not only for it's performance and quality but also for the company that is behind it!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00E7NWAKY" id="B00E7NWAKY-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-25:</strong> This is so convenient!

A silicone inner cover (the "skin") and a harder shell with 6 arms (the "skeleton") that wrap around the inner cover at the corners and two at the sides.  There is a kickstand in the skeleton that you used instead of the kickstand built into the TB.The very nice thing about this kickstand, is that it can support the phone from either side, which enables charging while you are watching a movie... very cool.I do not really notice much of a decrease in sound coming from the speaker phone (as others have mentioned).  I'd rather have the 2 way kickstand than that extra 2 decibels.  I seldom use that speaker anyway.Note that Seidio is currently selling a desktop stand/charger that allows you to not remove this case and charge it while it is one its side (see comments)I have also cut out the volume controls so that I am no longer accidentally changing the volume every time I touch the phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00526TW60" id="B00526TW60-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-25:</strong> This is one of the top of the line batteries, I had one for about 3 months everything was great til my sister did my laundry and washed the damn battery, other then that it's a winner!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00526TW60" id="B00526TW60-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-05:</strong> I have no complaints about the case.

Since HTC only includes a wimpy little battery that only lasts a few hours I don't see how you can't buy an extended battery to get through the day.  Initially I thought I could get away without it as things would balance out and battery life would improve and was using the regular battery with the Body Glove case which was perfect.  Alas, the included battery never got any better so I bought the extended one and unfortunately the Body Glove case wouldn't fit the phone with the extended battery and I can't find a Body Glove case to replace it so began the hunt for a new case.  This Seidio seemed to be the best option which arrived today and I already can't stand it especially compared to the Body Glove case. To point out the positives, it does install easily, fits the phone well, and seems like it will add a nice level of protection for the phone.  I also like the side grips quite a bit.  The Seidio does not feel the least bit slippery to me which is of course a good thing.  What I really dislike about the Seidio is that you can't use the sturdy included kickstand and the kickstand with the Seidio case is just an incredibly flimsy piece of plastic that feels like it may break at any time.  The kickstand is also an extremely tight fit into the case  nearly needing a pry bar to open it and its equally difficult to close.  Every time I close it the kickstand feels like its about to break off and it very well may very soon but I shouldn't have to worry about that each time I use it.  The kickstand also makes a very loud clicking sound when you close it.  That's not good when you need to be stealthy in a meeting, at the movies, etc. It also has a chemical smell to the case which transfers to your hands. I hope this smell fades over time and that its not toxic but for now I'm washing my hands more than ever thanks to this case. I suppose for now this is really the only choice unfortunately if you use the extended battery but I really look forward to the day when I can ditch it for a Body Glove case.  There is also no belt clip but in fairness I knew that before I bought it.  This isn't exactly a pocketable phone so get used to carrying it all of the time.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00526TW60" id="B00526TW60-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-11-04:</strong> Well made case for my HTC Thunderbolt rocking the extended battery.

When I got my Thunderbolt, I ordered the Seidio Convert Case (as you can see from my review, that was a big, big headache); since then, I purchsed the Sedio Active Case.  I give it 5 stars: fits in the belt clip effortlessly, phone can be charged easily, adds minimum size/weight to an already slightly oversized phone.  Yes, I notice the speaker is a tad muffled when I listen to the radio, but not the phone on speaker.I recommend the product...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00526TW60" id="B00526TW60-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-06-15:</strong> I have the standard Seidio Active Case for the Thunderbolt and was pleased enough with it to order the case for the extended battery.  In general, the things I said about the standard case apply here - good fit, looks good, and it seems as though it will provide a decent level of protection and will not pop off if/when you drop your phone.  Unlike another reviewer, I have found that the silicone attracts quite a bit of lint but, for me, it's not a deal breaker.  The biggest drawback to the extended case is that even with the Seidio kickstand extended, the skeleton portion of the case (and the phone's kickstand) cover the phone's speaker which muffles the sound.  Again, this is not a deal breaker but it is definitely a drawback.  As I said in my review of the standard Active Case, if Amazon allowed for 1/2 stars I'd probably give it a 3 1/2 but, since they don't, I will round up to 4.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00526TW60" id="B00526TW60-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-12:</strong> The stupid kickstand was the first part to fall off. That happened well with in the first two months. I ended up pulling the kickstand off and throwing it in the trash. The rubber jacket that goes on first collects dirt and debris that will eventually start to eat at the finish on the phone if you don't take it off periodically and clean it. The plastic exoskeleton lost one of it's clipping teeth about six months in. Since then it started cracking in half because I constantly had to remove it; simply, because it covers the speaker...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00526TW60" id="B00526TW60-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-11-14:</strong> I hate having cases on my phone but I do have to say, this case was a great decision. It is a silicone rubber case in addition to a plastic backing. It feels smooth and sturdy to the touch. I did drop my phone the other day from about 5 feet above the ground on hard tile flooring and it took the impact nicely. It isn't even scuffed up. It did transfer some of the color but that's about it.If you have an extended battery, I highly recommend this case.The only downsides I can think of, and this is totally splitting hairs, is that it attracts minute amounts of dirt/dust and that I find it difficult to remove the phone from my pocket while I trying to sneak a look at. The last thing, is that it only comes in black.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00526TW60" id="B00526TW60-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-16:</strong> This case with the holster for those who have bought an extended battery for Thunderbolt will find great functionality, along with supreme protection.

There are two things I don't like.  It's dependent on the car vents, so it only adjusts to the direction they go.  I'd prefer if I could tilt it more towards me rather than have it facing the back of the car.  Secondly, and I didn't think this one through, it blocks the AC vent it's attached to.  This makes the phone very, very cold (and I don't know if that is damaging) and it blocks the air.  In Texas, we need all the AC we can get in the summer.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EA3PCFQ" id="B00EA3PCFQ-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-11:</strong> Pretty nifty gadget, but I wish it was a bit more adjustable.

It sort of comes through there, it is very functional and offers pretty good protection for the device, however my phone weighs about twice as much. Also the accessories are not exactly cheap.

Comparing side-by-side of the same series of case for the s3 and s4, this looks like and feels like junk.

The Galaxy S4 case (which my significant other purchased at the same time) is rubberized on the sides so it's easy to hold onto.  As far as the Galaxy S3 case - I've almost dropped my GS3 phone IN the Kraken case a few times already, and I've only had it a few hours.  His kickstand isn't as hard to open as mine and he even has a hard time opening mine; it's as if the case is going to break in order to get the kickstand in the open position for the GS3 case.  BEWARE!I don't understand why there isn't rubberized grips on the GS3 hard case like there is on the GS4 hard case, and the GS3 case makes you PUT ON the screen protector, whereas the GS4 case already has it built in.  I'm very disappointed in this GS3 case and will be returning it.  It's claimed on the Trident website that it's such a great case, but in actuality, I have more of a &#34;drop risk&#34; using this case than I do a little cheap rubberized case!!  This Trident Kraken GS3 case is huge hazard to my phone!I would recommend NOT to purchase this phone case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008BR5W16" id="B008BR5W16-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-05:</strong> This is my first actual &#34;Rugged&#34; type of phone case. I'm more used to tpu's and thin shell type cases but ever since my first galaxy s3 broke from a drop with the Ringke Slim case I decided I should play it safe and get a rugged case for my replacement.Just got the case today so I'm not sure how the protection is but it definitely looks like its well protected. The thickness isn't as bad as I thought it would be but I have bigger hands so others might think its a little too big.The silicon Perseus case fits it well. It can be used by itself if you don't want the full bulk of the case but I don't think I would use it by itself much. The power/volume buttons are hard to hit with just the silicon skin because the skin is nice and thick to make it hard to reach.The outer polycarbonate shell fits around the silicon very nicely and snuggly. I don't like built in screen protectors because they tend to interfere and this one doesn't come with a built in. It does come with an included free one but it's not too great. The port plugs fit awesomely. It is true that the top speaker cutout isn't centered but it doesn't effect call quality and you can't really see because there's a mesh covering the opening. It probably wouldn't have fit if they moved it over to the right more that might be why.The belt clip I think is great! It's small and doesn't look ridiculous on your hip. Other reviews seem to hate the clip because it's so small and hard to work but honestly its so easy to get it clipped on even without looking. It just slides right into the grooves by itself. The only hard part I can understand is getting it out but there's a way to get it out one handed if you just put your index finger sideways in between the clip and phone and leverage the phone out it comes out easily! You just have to try it a few times.So far this case is great! Oh and I chose this case over otterbox defender because I like the hard outershell instead of silicon outershell. Shipping was also fantastic. Got it in 2 days from the free super savers 5-7 day option! Probably because I was so close to their smartpost.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008BR5W16" id="B008BR5W16-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-15:</strong> I really love these brand of cases....Trident makes great covers and they last...They also look really nice and are very durable...I definitely would buy them off amazon any time</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008BR5W16" id="B008BR5W16-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-14:</strong> Original Review: 10/14/2012Original Rating: &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;Awesome case, great protection, and great skin, I might go with another color option for the AMS shell, but great case overall!

Nice and protective, sturdy and good quality.  I read the reviews that the stand is cheap and broke immediately.  I don't understand that as the stand is a sturdy, nice piece of metal.  What I am not so sure about is the buttons to turn the phone on/off and the volume buttons.  They are ultra sensitive and just carrying my phone turns it on if I even slightly tap them.  At first I thought, wow these buttons are great (my otterbox was a BEAR when I first got it, so HARD to push) but then I realized if the wind blows it turns on!  I would highly recommend this case to others.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008BR5W16" id="B008BR5W16-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-29:</strong> Got this case for my T-Mobile Samsung Gallaxy X3 and fits perfectly!!

The volume control and on/off button are easier to push with this case.  It has a metal kickstand that is hard to open and the belt clip is cheaply put together so I do not use it.

I was a bit skeptical about these, but am pleasantly surprised at how well they've held up. Only time will tell in the long run on the durability factor. The portion that plugs into your car is a nice size and easy to insert and remove...as it the end of the charger that goes into your device. My only complaint is the packaging and shipping. The items were shipped individually in thin white boxes (all contained in a large yellow envelope) and arrived looking as if a hippo had taken a long nap on them. Fortunately, the chargers didn't appear damaged in shipping and function well. I can only give this item three stars since I have yet to find out if they'll still work properly in a year or to...and the packaging for shipping was very disappointing. Otherwise, if you're looking for an inexpensive charger (these would make a great backup charger...never hurts to have a spare!) this item will do quite well.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003TW77KC" id="B003TW77KC-review59" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-19:</strong> This is just another iPhone charger.

It takes a little bit longer to get it but you get the low low price because you skip about 3 levels of distribution.  The plastic is well molded, the connections are good quality and the contact in the power socket is first rate (contacts in 3 places instead of just 2 like on the cheaper ones).  The phone or iPod connector is also very well made.  This item is well worth the price and wait.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003TW77KC" id="B003TW77KC-review113" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-14:</strong> This charger works wonderful!

With my Galaxy Nexus, I needed to charge three times a day or more with the stock battery. Overnight, mid morning, again in the afternoon, and perhaps yet again in the evening so that I had enough power left to finish out the day. On really slow days, I was looking at just charging over night and again at midday. After popping in the ZeroLemon extended battery, all that changed. Once fully charged up, heavy days only dropped the battery to ~40% and average days to ~60%, So now, I might need a charge every day and a half at most. Given that this battery has several times the capacity as the stock one, this information shouldn't be too surprising.The offset to all the run time is of course the added size and weight that has been added to my Nexus. Roughly, it's a little more than double thick now with the case on. And, you're going to have to use the included case, as no one else that I'm aware of makes a case to fit this monster in. It's not bad though, allowing free access to all the ports and buttons, not to mention fits well. If you use NFC, have no fear with this battery/case combo. It works just fine. And finally, it could be just me, but I've found that the added size helps a bit with texting, as in, it's easier to type.  It does take some getting used to in terms of the size and weight though.All in all, love it so far and still have 160 days to see if I can break it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AZZOH04" id="B00AZZOH04-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-06:</strong> I dont know what i do wrong with my batteries.

Both microphones are completely blocked and the device is unusable as a phone without modifying the case, which is easier said than done.The battery part works as advertised, but since it requires the case to stay in the device and the case prevents the device from being used as a phone, I can't rate it highly. Adds a lot of weight and bulk but that's to be expected.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AZZOH04" id="B00AZZOH04-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-25:</strong> Several weeks ago the folks that make the[ZeroLemon Samsung Galaxy Nexus 5900mAh Extended Battery )sent me one of these to test.  Here in Vermont it can be a long way to get help if you break down and pay phones are few and very far between, so it is important that the cell phone is always  charged.  I keep a cell phone around of course, but I don't use it a lot (mine is always dead when I need it), so after I examined the product, checked the fit and read all the paperwork, I twisted my son-in-law's arm to do the actual testing for me, since he is a Wireless Expert for one of the big phone companies and virtually lives on his phone, which always seems to need charging.First, a bit of a description -  The battery pack replaces the one in your phone and comes with an replacement phone back.  After installation (takes less than a minute) your phone will be about twice as thick as it was* and weigh close to twice as much.  The battery  comes with a 180 day guarantee.  Let me give you the reports directly from my SIL -SIL - So just a status update with the battery.  I am very happy with it.  I unplugged it at 7:30 yesterday morning (I received this at 11 am)  and as of right now I have 12% battery life. One downfall is the bulkiness of the phone* now, but I don't mind that considering the battery life.GRANDMA - That's excellent.  Your wife said you have been playing on it quite a bit.  Do you have any estimate of the number of hours you've used by any chance?  And will it still fit in your pocket?SIL -  Phone use has been 21 hours 38 minutes and 23 seconds.  Cell turned on 1 day 2  hrs 50 minutes and 27 seconds. And yes it still fits in my pockets but someone with tight pockets may have a problem. I have not tried with jeans yet that have tighter pockets.  (He took the phone camping in his jeans - no problem at all.)SIL -  My battery just died.  I got so much out of one charge.  Having it charge right now,  will tell you how long it takes to charge,  but from 7:30 yesterday morning till 4:30pm is excellent and best battery life that I have ever had!SIL - To fully charge it takes four hours but that is with me using it while charging it.  If I don't use it,  about three hours.Several weeks later, the battery is still going strong and I haven't seen my SIL's phone plugged into the car charger once.  (He tells me he puts it on the charger every other night when he goes to bed.)  I suspect I'll get that battery back only if I pry the cell phone from his cold dead hands.Grandma's $0.02 - AWESOME battery life!  Two thumbs up!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AZZOH04" id="B00AZZOH04-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-21:</strong> Just not enough juice for the extra girth.

My original 2100 battery (this is the ORIGINAL Verizon version of the Galaxy Nexus from 2011,) only lasted about 8 hours.  So I bought a Trexell 3800 that wasn't much better.  I then bought the Seidio 3800 and my phone was lasting 20-36 hours depending on use. This past month or so, it was not lasting more than 8 hours or so.I had intended on buying another Seidio, but I originally paid about $40 and now they want $60.  No way.  This ZeroLemon was about $40 so I thought I would give it a try.SOO GLAD I DID.  Yes it makes the phone thicker, but I don't mind that.  I have only completely discharged it three times so far (you are supposed to do it 6 times) and I have had to keep it off the charger for up to three nights and it finally drains late into the next day.BIG BONUS:  The clip for the Siedio fits this case.  The Siedio surface case was almost necessary to keep the battery back on the phone or the back would fall off and the battery would fall out.  I was buying a new surface case for the Seidio every 4-6 months.  The clip could be bought separately.The case for this battery is MUCH better.  It actually adds a bit of protection for the phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AZZOH04" id="B00AZZOH04-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-09:</strong> A surprisingly good fit, that gives my Galaxy Nexus new-found endurance.I really like my Galaxy Nexus and use it heavily, but between steady usage and sometimes poor Sprint coverage, I was charging or topping-off the factory-original battery 1-2, even 3 times a day, and it was making my phone much less useful-- running low or dying outright (usually at inconvenient times).I didn't expect much of this third-party battery, and figured it would be an awkward fit, but it turns out to fit the Nexus very snugly and precisely-- it would be a struggle to get the replacement cover off the phone now (it was pretty easy to get into place). The new back is rubbery instead of plasticy like the original.  It doesn't look elegant, but it works fine, and after two months of constant use hasn't show any signs of wear.And the battery life... Oh the battery life!  I got 3 days, 4 hours on battery the very first time I had this ZeroLemon installed-- and it wasn't even completely drained at the end of that. Typically I charge the battery every 2 days now, just to keep a full charge.  Quite the improvement!Do follow the vendor's recommended charging procedures, but even without doing it rigorously, the results are excellent (my first-time results were from charging a few hours less than recommended).  So charging directions are very particular, and are certainly going to give optimal results, but don't sweat it if you don't follow them exactly.Also, the ZeroLemon does still support NFC, so you don't lose that function by going with an aftermarket battery.  It really Just Works, which is a great thing (and sometimes unusual in the aftermarket product sector).As far as caveats and concerns: The side buttons take a slightly firmer press now (through the rubber shell), but still work fine. The speakerphone (which I rarely use) is a bit muffled by being recessed more deeply than before.  If charging while powered off, the battery symbol shows full soon enough, but you shouldn't detach it yet (booted up, you'll see it's still charging). Since the battery capacity now shows red/critically low for many hours (up to a day in my use) before failing, you may also find Android stops polling for updates before it needed to (that's adjustable, but the default settings turn off syncing/updating when battery is critical).The large battery also takes a while to charge, so you can't just throw it on the charger for a few minutes to top-up (but neither do you have to top-up often), instead I usually plan when I'll need to charge the phone and do so overnight so it's fully charged and ready to go when I leave in the morning. Exchanging the old constant charging and being tethered to USB power, for occasionally having to plan ahead when to charge is a decent trade-off in my book.The other big adjustment I had to make was the increased heft-- the phone is now much bigger and much heavier than before, although it still fits well in my front jeans pocket. Holding the phone up for a while (like lying in bed) definitely reminds my wrist that the phone weighs more now.  The grip still feels natural in my hand.[ I was given this product for the purposes of review. I received no other compensation, and my review is my honest opinion of the product. ]I'd wish for better accuracy in how Android perceives its battery capacity-- the extended "critical" period makes it hard to predict how much juice you really have left. The brand name might be on the unusual side, but the extended run-time and easy integration make this ZeroLemon high-capacity battery a winner. Highly Recommended.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AZZOH04" id="B00AZZOH04-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-08:</strong> First, customer service. The items arrived a day ahead of schedule. They were well-packaged but, when I opened the envelopes, the TPU case had a small scuff on it. Not terrible, but a bit annoying for a new item. I wanted to start using the battery, though, so I installed it (with the scuffed case) and I took a photo of the scuff, and emailed it to Bastexwireless via Amazon, asking if they would be willing to replace the case. I asked that I be allowed to keep the scuffed case in the meantime, to allow me to use the battery. Next day I got a friendly reply, saying that a new case would be put in the mail that day. Sure enough, the replacement case arrived a few days later, in perfect shape. Great customer service.Second, the battery. It's awesome.  It arrived Tuesday. Upon installation, it showed a charge level of 64%. After charging it overnight as directed, I unplugged the phone at 6:30AM Wednesday, and used it very heavily during the day -- far more heavily than usual, because I wanted to run the battery down as fast as I could, so that I could complete the recommended several cycles of &#34;deplete / recharge&#34; in as few days as possible.  Even with heavy use, it lasted more than 24 hours. That included almost 10 hours of screen-on time, and almost constant WiFi & 4G connection. (My phone is rooted, I'm running KitKat 4.4.2 on Shiny ROM). I let the phone run down to 2% charge (it reached that level about 9AM Thursday, i.e., after about 26.5 hours) then I put it on a charger; it took about 6 hours to reach full charge.So I unplugged it Thursday about 3PM, and used the phone normally. It lasted through Thursday, all day Friday, and through to Saturday late evening before I put it on an overnight charge. Unplugged it 7AM Sunday morning, used it all day, and didn't put it on charge overnight. Same thing Monday, and no overnight charge. It's now Tuesday, 2:30PM (almost 2.5 days after unplugging the phone) and it's reading 37% !!I still have a few cycles of full charge / full discharge to go, but it seems pretty amazing. I used to charge my phone overnight every night, but with this battery I expect to be charging the phone only every second (or perhaps third) night.  More importantly, though -- no more having to &#34;baby&#34; the phone during the day !</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AZZOH04" id="B00AZZOH04-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-28:</strong> Superior to all others, the battery itself, and also included case, are beyond those of any competitors for the sa!me device.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AZZOH04" id="B00AZZOH04-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-30:</strong> Now that I have had some time using this battery I will say it is awesome!  I have taken the charger out of my car and office.  The only time I charge now is at night.  It isn't that I need to charge it most nights but rather, that I want to make sure I have enough power for the next night.  I leave the screen on while using my GPS and All Access for an hour or two at a time.  Though I don't always run it down all the way I am getting 16-18 hours a day with 3+ hours of screen time and I still have over 35% at the least.  I could easily get 24-30+ hours of use on a full charge. This battery is worth every dollar I paid for it.The battery is really large but for the ability to use my phone and just leave the screen on and not be tethered to a charger all of the time is a fair trade.  I carried a Blackberry years ago and this isn't much worse than that was size and weight-wise.  I like the case and it is protective.  If you really want to use your phone and don't want to be bound to an outlet all of the time buy one of these batteries.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AZZOH04" id="B00AZZOH04-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-09:</strong> This battery works!  That's all there is to say about that.  I went from about 10 hours total between charges, to 36. I would also only get about 1 hour of screen time, before my phone was needing a charge.  Now, I get over 4 hours, and my desk at work is in a very poor area for signal.The only shortcoming is the case.  It's good, but not great.  Like others have said, both microphones are covered by the case.  You need to modify the case to uncover the microphones.  This is a glaring omission on ZeroLemon's part.  I hope they fix this in future revisions of the case.  Also, the cover doesn't fit properly over the top of the phone, near the ear piece.  It's difficult to remove the case from the phone, so I'm not worried about it coming off, but it just doesn't look good.  Lastly, the buttons for volume and power are hard to press with the case on.  I ended up having to cut holes in the case, so I wouldn't have to push too hard on the phone, just so it would turn on.The phone feels good in the hand, despite the extra heft of the battery.  Without a case, this phone is slippery.  I am still able to use the phone one handed, and I have no issues with space in my pocket for the phone.If ZeroLemon fixes the issues with the case, I'd gladly give this a 5 star review.  I wanted to give it a 3 star review, but because the battery is so awesome, I gave it a 4.You can check out pictures and my review over at XDA ([...]</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00AZZOH04', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00AZZOH04', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00GJXMEEC</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00GJXMEEC</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

Lets' start with the positive:PROS:-Very easy to install.-Precision cuts (it's not joke) This is perhaps the best fitting aftermarket screen protector I have ever used.-Detailed instructions (both video and written)CONS:-It has a bit of a rubberized feel, making the S-Pen to skip a bit. (I have noticed that with use, this seems to decrease, but not entirely).-This is minor, but it did not include an applicator squeegee or hard hard to get rid of the bubbles.I have read that there are options in the materials of the tips provided by Samsung, yet I feel that if you are marketing a product for a specific device, it should comply without the need the customer modifying the the device.Over all, you cannot beat the VALUE of this product.

And for good reason.  The other wasn't as well suited for the galaxy note.  This one has a cut out at the bottom for the home button, as well as cutouts at the top for the speaker and camera.  The package comes with 3, and the well-written instructions indicate that if you screw it up, they'll send you a new one for free!  The dust cloth is also one of the better ones I've ever gotten with screen protectors (it's bigger and more substantial than they usually are -- in fact, just used it to clean my touch screen computer screen!)  My only recommendation would be to install from bottom up as lining up with the home button is probably the most important on there.  Would definitely buy again!By the way, big THANKS to the reviewer who mentioned the other S pen tips.  Definitely needed to switch out the rubber tip for the included plastic tip to glide on the screen while writing notes (the rubber gets caught).

They sent me an email with additional info on how to optimally apply the protector before Amazon shipped it to me.  It arrived timely, and had everything in the pack I expected.  I went to iSmooth's website and found an instruction video for my phone (note3), which helped.  Ultimately, by using the dust stickers, I got every speck and have a clean application on the first protector.  My first.  I recommend watching their videos and reading the instructions.Lastly, for note 3 S-pen users, yes, the default tip on the pen feels rough on screen protectors. I tried it on several types of protectors and all of them were about the same as the iSmooth.  The Trick:  the default tip in your S-pen is a slightly rubberized one.  In the tip/nib pack that comes with the phone, there are three rubberized and two plastic tips.  If you look at them with magnified lenses (reading glasses), you can see which is which (rubberized ones are dull, plastic a little more shiny).  Replace the tip with the Samsung S-pen tool and use a plastic one to get smooth action on the screen protector.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FDX4U1E" id="B00FDX4U1E-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-25:</strong> These are good ones!

Except for a very tiny amount (less then 1mm) around the very outside edges of the screen and the sensors these cover the entire screen. The iSmooth screen protectors come with a full size screen cleaning cloth unlike most that give you a stamp sized one and this also comes with dust removal stickers that work perfectly to remove that offending piece of debris if you have a little dust bubble after application.

After reading the reviews I decided to give this one try. Mostly because it was an Ultra Prem HD and "bubble free" installation. I received the package today (10/30 and installed it). Package comes with everything listed and I actually liked the dust removal stickers, they did come in handy. I did a few practice line ups to see how it would look aligned up correctly. I had to do two attempts doing the real installation because I kind of slipped and it started not line up correctly. This is the reason I did not give it a full five stars, it says bubble free installation guaranteed but there were bubbles. The bubbles that appeared in the middle immediately disappeared but on each corner of the top it does not seem to want to stick and cant get rid of the bubbles. I decided to try another screen (it comes with three) and it had done the same thing. Now this is not a deal breaker at all. This item is still very much amazing and I WOULD recommend them to anyone. However, it was slightly disappointing to have the issues at the top when it says bubble free guaranteed.Again, I would recommend this to others as the quality and HD lives up to its name!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FDX4U1E" id="B00FDX4U1E-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-08:</strong> This is a great screen protector at a very reasonable price.+ Crisp, clear image - I can't even tell it is on my phone+ Accurate touch - again, I cannot tell it is on my phone (other than using the S-Pen... see more below)+ Comes with a cloth and cleaning stickers (to get off all the extra specs of dust)+ Easy to install+ AMAZING customer service!- The S-Pen sticks a little bit more when writing - it still works just fine, but there is a noticeable increase in friction if you are a heavy S-Pen user.TIP: use a plastic tip on the S-pen if you find it to be a problem.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FDX4U1E" id="B00FDX4U1E-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-05:</strong> Why would I buy these when you can get the best screen protectors from Treasure Valley.

Usually with the use of the Spen, the screen protector shows marks and signs of &#34;pen tracks&#34;. With this screen protector, I haven't seen any, and I use the Spen a lot.Another really good thing about this screen protector is the simplicity of installation. I know they all have the same general method, but this one doesn't require the use of any liquids. Also the cloth used to clean the dust is large enough so you can get the dust off and then cover the screen until you have the screen protector ready to install and it minimizes the dust under the protector which makes it look better and last longer.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FDX4U1E" id="B00FDX4U1E-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-26:</strong> Listen, I was really skeptical at first.  I only used the screen protectors that use the liquid and squeegee on almost all of my devices.  I hated that most of these type of screen protectors were either nonHD or claimed to be HD but were still hazy.I have seen the light with this protector.  With more than 3000+ reviews and a rating of almost perfect 5 out of 5, I can see why this is rated as it is.I had to go through 2 protectors til i got it perfect the 3rd time. I'm a bit of a perfectionist but I feel that the tape on the second film was a bit too sticky, which kept removing the screen protector and thus removing the stickyness of it.Quick TIP: WATCH the Install Video and Install the protector in the bathroom after someone takes a hot shower. I did it for my 3rd try and voila, perfect to my standards.  I just wish I could get back the other 2 protectors that were wasted.The price point to quality is on point.  Not only is this Screen protector HD quality but i can't even tell it's on my screen.  I literally have to feel above, by the camera where the screen protector leaves a gap just to make sure its still on.Also , with a phone with a breathtaking display, you don't want to hinder the beauty of it.  Unlike many of the screen protectors on the market, this will not hinder the screen.  i think It makes it look even better IMO.  More clean and pristine.Don't even doubt buying this.  Get it for whatever other devices you have. Ismooth and the Japanese made PET is the way to go.I love anything Japanese because I feel their products are supremely well made and work better than almost half the things I come across.  I recommend this and the Ismooth brand to everyone and anyone.  These are the best screen protectors I've ever  used in my ENTIRE LIFE.  At the price point along with the lifetime warranty, this is a greatest deal i've ever come across with screen protectors.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FDX4U1E" id="B00FDX4U1E-review21" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-27:</strong> No bubbles and installs in less than a min.

The install instructions were very detailed and straight forward.  They even had a website you could visit to watch a video of the installation process for those that need visuals.  Although they didn't have an install video for the Note 3, they did have a video for the Note 2.  The video instructions sequence was the following: Turn off phone, wipe down screen with cleaning cloth, remove tab 1 and apply screen protector, identify dust bubbles (not air bubbles) and use dust removal stickers to remove the dust, finish applying screen protector pushing out all air bubbles, and remove tab 2.  I figured why should I apply the screen protector first to identify dust bubbles.  After cleaning the screen with the cleaning cloth, I used a dust removal sticker all throughout the screen before applying the screen protector.  After doing this, I did not see a single dust bubble.  Once I pushed out all the air bubbles, the screen appeared crystal clear.Overall, this screen protector looks great.  I highly recommend this screen protector.  This product also has a lifetime warranty.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FDX4U1E" id="B00FDX4U1E-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-21:</strong> The fit and finish are great. 5 Stars for sure. That's not the issue. Let me add that the clarity of the screen protector is great too. My only dislike is how it feels kind of cheap in terms of you being able to tell it's there as it has that slight softness to it that does affect the touch sensitivity. Therefore, I just went into settings -&#62; Controls -&#62; and checked &#34;Increase touch sensitivity.&#34; It seems to help, but the point is that I should have to do that at all. Bottom line, there are better quality screen protectors out there where you can't even tell &#34;by feel&#34; that it is on the phone. Anyhow, it'll do for now.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FDX4U1E" id="B00FDX4U1E-review28" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-09:</strong> I bought this model it seem not much finger print on my phone now.

I read the instructions because I have never used a protector before, and being a Galaxy Note 3 with an unscratchable display, I didn't see the reason to use one, but my GF insisted so I gave it a try.I bought the iSmooth ones because they were cheap and had very high rating with very good feedback from other buyers.So I got them, read the instructions and went ahead and apply them.Yes, I had to apply two because my first one was a test and it didn't go very good, I started to see bubbles everywhere so I cleaned the screen again but there were still a couple of bubbles at the bottom right edge, and in my attempt to lift it a bit, I ended up by printing my beatiful fingerprint in it. It look beautifully awful like that, so I used it as a test, see how to fit it properly, used the microfiber clieaning cloth and then tried with the second one.It was still a little like a surgery, I had to be very precise and used one of the dust removal stickers to clean the plastic a few times.After that, I finally could make it go fit right into place, with no bubbles anywhere, but yet a bit if a fingerprint at the top left edge, unnoticeable, thanks God... actually, I don't see it, so maybe there was no fingerprint after all.Now that it is in place, I have to say that is not as confortable as using the Note 3 without it, it may need time to leave the sticky sansation off, since with time it started to feel better than at the very first moment.Doing things like moving widgets or shortcuts from one screen to the other, makes it feel like plastic over the screen, but that is what it is, isn't it?After a few minutes playing around with my phone, the Sticky sansation is no longer perceptible, however, still persist when dragging icons from one home screen to another, specially at the very edge.My Super cool Note 3 now looks well protected, the iSmooth Ultra Clear Premium HD Screen protector is really clear, unperceptible to whoever does not know it is there, no real bulk added to the already big Smartphone.I am stil getting used to it, I love the soft touchscreen of my Note 3 and this plastic protector does not feel that good; but it really looks good and is easy to clean, too.If you want a screen protector, get these, the lifetime warranty will replace the ones you damage, that is what it said, I am not going to claim it for the one I ruined because I am a real novice when it comes to these things, I don't like them to be honest, but it is nice to know they will replace them if you need to.I am happy, although I said I don't like these things, I have to say that after 30 minutes battling to put it on, my phone still looks awesome.Do I recommend it? Yes, I do.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FDX4U1E" id="B00FDX4U1E-review32" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-06:</strong> Not much more to say than what's already been said.

I started off with having lint particles actually on the pieces themselves before removing any of the protective films. ( I have applied screen protectors many times before to other devices so I always check ) Even with the dust remover stickers, I could not get the lint to come completely clean from the application side of the protector. Very disappointed. I decided since I had 3 pcs, I would try to run some water over the protector and wash off any particles. The protector is just sticky enough that the water would not remove anything. Got mad and threw first one in the trash. Second one looked cleaner and I thought I would be able to get the lint off, was wrong again. Those dust and lint stickers are there to piss you off not help you. I spent 700.00 on my phone and I will not stand for having these small raised dots on my screen. Second one was crumpled up and pitched as well. Third protector was dirtier than the first, didn't even bother; trash. I know they have a money back guarantee. My review isn't about customer service, it is about the initial quality of a product.

It's not. I managed to put a gouge in one device screen a week after I'd bought it, to my horror followed by months of muttering and self loathing. The near invisible sheet of film of a screen protector will run interference and save both your peace of mind and the resale value of your expensive telephone investment. Admittedly, applying protective film to any glass surface can be a mind-numbing exercise that requires patience and more skill than you might first imagine. That's one reason why car window tinters, for example, often charge a small fortune.  Previous screen protection products I've used all came with small bottles of fluids and tiny squeegees, so it was a relief to see that this iSmooth product was liquid free.  Basically, you receive a film &#34;sandwich&#34;. The top and bottom layers have tabs that help you peel them off. Peel off the top two inches of the bottom layer, align it, place the now exposed middle layer of the sandwich over your screen. Continue to peel the tabbed outer layer off and pressing the rest of the mid protective layer against your screen. Once that's complete, you gently peel the top layer of the sandwich off grabbing its tabbed edge. Finish by smoothing the film out with the included microfiber cloth to make certain of full contact and adhesion as well as to eliminate any trapped air that will form a small bubble. If you were a bit off on the alignment, you can lift the film up again to reposition it. Try to avoid that by not being in a hurry. The single most important factor in this process is keeping clean and most of all DUST FREE. Any tiny speck of dust will prevent the film from contacting the glass and cause a visible bubble. ISmooth includes several small stickers that you can use to lift dust off of either the screen or the sticky side of the film just before it makes contact with the screen. You can use scotch tape if you prefer to remove a speck. Make sure you have a well lit work area so you can see the surfaces you're working with up close. If you make a bonehead mistake, fear not. Your package has 3 film &#34;sandwiches&#34; so you get several do-overs should you need them. There's a web address provided where you can watch the process and complete your film school if you like. The process is really very simple with dust being your only nemesis.  I loved that there was no drying time like past protectors required. There were absolutely no bubbles or marks of any kind. The protective film in place  looks exactly like the glass screen did without it. Screen touch reactance is exactly the same as well. The name Ultra Premium HD sounds a little overdone and self aggrandizing, but the results are spectacular. Invisible protection. On that day you shriek in horror to see what the key in your pocket did to the phone the one time  you flung it in there, you'll be glad you took the time and minimal expense. There's a lifetime guarantee, so if you manage to use the three films they send you, you're still covered. There are more expensive alternates, but I couldn't be happier with my results!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FDX4U1E" id="B00FDX4U1E-review37" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-01:</strong> This screen protector offers excellent protection.

In a perfect world, you won't notice it's there, and should you manage to pick up a scratch on your screen, you can rest easy knowing it's not on the glass, but on the replaceable protector.Many screen protectors claim to be invisible, and/or undetectable.  This is _never_ the case.  However, this particular protector is ALMOST imperceptible, which I appreciate.  It so far has done a good job of not getting scratched during the 3-4 weeks I've been using it, which I also appreciate (because if you're putting a screen protector on your device, it's because a scratched screen bothers you and even though it's just the protector, it still looks terrible if it gets scratched).Installation was easy enough for my ham hands, but I did manage to get 2 tiny dust particles under the bottom right edge and a tiny bubble along the left edge that with a bulkier case would be covered (I have tried to push it out being right on the edge, but I must have damaged the adhesive during installation and now it just won't stay down).The pack comes with most of the the things you'll need for installation, a dust-free lens wiper, and protective covers with tags for easier maneuvering during install, instructions etc.  I waited until the wife was in the shower and took advantage of a steamy bathroom to further reduce my chances of dust, and it all went pretty smoothly considering my ham-handedness.So why did I give this protector 4 stars when I so far have given it a 5-star worthy review?  Well, there's just one thing, really.The number one thing I don't like is the texture of the protector was extremely unpleasant to my finger at first, and caused the S-Pen to drag, which made me not want to use my phone, and almost caused me to pull the protector off and throw it away.  But I decided to give it a chance since I'm cheap and this cost me money, and as I've used it more, it has stopped dragging the S-Pen (not entirely, but it's manageable now) and the texture has become less unpleasant (again, not completely, but better none the less).  The pad of my finger can still become a little sore from extended use, but it does take a while for it to start getting annoying now, and when it does I just switch to the S-Pen.  Also, I can see it from a mile away.  And I hate that, but I realize this is my own neurosis, and that the average person isn't going to see it even with the imperfections from my botched install (so after some mental wrestling with myself I've bumped  the review to 4 stars over my initial 3).Other things about this protector you probably want to know: It seems to be relatively good at resisting major fingerprints, but does collect some.  It's fairly easy to wipe off, but not as easy as the bare screen was.  However the bare screen collected fingerprints like a champ, so it's a trade off.  And it is cut very well so the edges all line up with the device nicely, making it that much harder to see.  So fine, I'll ignore the nagging neurosis screaming in the back of my head for 3 stars and give it 4 stars.  I don't think I will ever in my life be able to give any screen protector 5 stars, so consider this a glowing review.  Also, a few up votes wouldn't hurt since I am pretty sure I've mentally scared myself for life with this 4 star review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FDX4U1E" id="B00FDX4U1E-review55" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-08:</strong> This screen protector does exactly what I wanted it to do:  protect the screen of my new Samsung Galaxy Note 3 without becoming a distraction.It was easy to apply. I used the &#34;hinge&#34; method to apply it instead of the method recommended by the manufacturer. I used this method because I have found that it is the easiest way to assure proper alignment and placement. And because I used this method and the fact that this screen protector was perfectly cut, I got the exact fit that I wanted. For the first time ever, I had to use one of the little sticky Dust Removal Stickers included in the kit, and it too worked very well.Sensitivity and clarity are also excellent. I only need to use the lightest touch on the screen to get a response, which speaks well for the screen on the Note 3 and for this screen protector. I chose the clear protector to maximize the visibility of the screen, and the visibility is excellent as long as the screen is not in bright sunlight. There is a little glare in bright sunlight, but that's always going to be true when you use a clear protector, regardless of the brand, so I'm OK with that -- just turn so that your phone is shaded by your body and you'll be OK.I hope to own this phone for a good long time, so maybe I'll actually get to use all 3 screen protectors that come in this pack. So far though, the one I applied seems like it will last a good long time.This is a good screen protector and cheap insurance for your smartphone's screen. And as always, Amazon's price and fast delivery just make the deal that much sweeter.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FDX4U1E" id="B00FDX4U1E-review56" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-28:</strong> This is probably the easiest to apply screen protector I have ever put on a phone.

My perfect screen protector was one I purchased in the Apple Store for the original iPhone in 2007. It was super clear, thin, and slick. These days, all screen protectors seem to be thicker and somewhat sticky.I wasn't sure if I was going to give this 4 or 5 stars. I wanted to give it 4 because it's not perfectly slippery like I want it to be...it still has some resistance when using the stylus on the Samsung Note 3. However, I'm giving it 5 because it's way better than other screen protectors sold these days AND they included several &#34;dust stickers&#34; - those dust stickers makes a HUGE difference. Thank you for those!I'm still looking for that thin, glossy, slippery screen protector though. Let me know if you know what I'm talking about and were to find it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FDX4U1E" id="B00FDX4U1E-review63" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-22:</strong> I used to work AT&T; retail and installed iPhone 3G and 3Gs screen protectors for customers and it was an absolute nightmare.  These screen protectors have restored my faith as after my previous experiences I began using the liquid adhesive types of screen protectors - not the biggest fan of them because it's almost like rubbing your finger against rubber...Not these though!!  Installation was absolutely clear and super simple.  I luckily was able to get it on the second try without any bubbles, so that pumped me up even more.  I have a case over my Note 3 and you absolutely cannot tell that this screen protector is on the screen.  I admit that I avoided putting these on my phone because of the work I thought it would have required, (4 months later - call me lazy).Lifetime guarantee for any scenario - AND three of them come in the packaging.

I've even applied screen protectors using the identical three layer process.  I have never had a problem.  Yet I just spent an HOUR trying to successfully get one of these useless things on my Samsung Galaxy Note 3.  I'm on protector number two and will have to try my third and last, but I'm thinking I'm out 10 bucks and my time and I'm feeling frustrated and even angry.The protector is so thick and rigid that when I try to smooth the "1" backing down as I ATTEMPT to install the protector, the whole protector lifts off the phone (the backing isn't tacky enough to resist its desire to straighten), ruining the carefully placed alignment. I finally removed more than two inches of that backing so there's enough to actually stick to the phone.  I thought I actually got it but there were HUGE air pockets around the edges of the phone.  In error, I thought I could "buff" them out, but it's impossible (and no, they're not from dust).  And NOW, there's no protective backing so the entire screen protector needs to be lifted and re=smoothed with the whole thing exposed to air and potential dust.  I suspect this is design related with the protector being a bit too wide.  The slightly raised lip of the Galaxy Note 3 makes it impossible to get the protector flush against the sides of the device, so it lifts (air pockets).  You can try to smooth out the huge air gaps but they return again and again because you can't get the protector 100% flush against the phone.The first protector somehow got a hairline crease in it, so I had to try a second protector and experienced the same air pockets.  Now, dust has inevitably comes into play from my many frustrated attempts to fit this stupid thing (dust removal stickers are a sick joke - they do NOT remove dust from the protector's tacky side at all), so I'm going to have try the third - and I ALWAYS get protectors installed first try.  I've never needed to go to a second, never mind a third.Unless you enjoy futility, frustration and wasting money, AVOID.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FDX4U1E" id="B00FDX4U1E-review67" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-07:</strong> When a product box says: see our video before trying to put on the screen protector, you know you're in trouble.

It's very clear but does show lots of finger prints and lint. Installation is not difficult, but you will have to smooth out air bubbles with your fingers or a business card. This type of screen protector is not going to protect your expensive phone screen from a serious flat faced drop on a hard surface like a top of the line glass protector (Iloome or Spigen) with a hardness of 8 or 9, but it's better than nothing for protection against light abrasions and short/soft drops. Also, since they are inexpensive (3 in a box), they can easily be replaced as needed. If you're the very careful type with your electronic gear, this might be all you need.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FDX4U1E" id="B00FDX4U1E-review74" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-11:</strong> So I ruined the first one I tried, but I've never really been good at applying screen protectors.  Once I got it set up, it looks great.  You can't feel that you have a screen protector on the phone at all.  The only thing that I've noticed is an issue when using the SPen: usually you can hover it over your text box and get a pop up to write your message.  That doesn't seem to work anymore, but I've been able to use other functions. This phone goes in my bag or coat pocket and mingles with my keys.  There are very faint scratches on the protector.

So it is going to take some time under a bright lamp to get the installation right.  Just be patient.  It can be done.  Eventually.  I did manage with the first protector but it took more than 20 iterations of realigning the leading edge.  I think this protector could stand to be a tiny minuscule bitty bit smaller.  Just enough that putting it on isn't microsurgery.  On the other hand, if your microsurgery is successful, it is right up to the edge and that much more invisible and nice for it.Once it is on, the protector is absolutely smooth and invisible.  But, you'll notice that your s-pen wants to drag and stick.  That's because you don't have the right nib in it.  Remember that tiny little packet of nibs and that little metal nib remover that shipped with your Note 3?  Take a really close look at those nibs.  2 of them are a slightly different color of greyish white than the others.  Those are the less rubbery ones that work with screen protectors.  Swap out your nib and you won't have a problem. In fact it might even be a little smoother than before.(You may now commence destroying your office attempting to locate the itty bitty little pack of nibs.  It's gotta be somewhere, right?)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FDX4U1E" id="B00FDX4U1E-review78" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-21:</strong> A pain to get on, took two screen protectors to finally get it right, even after watching instructional video.  Protector is a tight cut to the profile of the phone so not much room for mistakes while lining it up to apply to the phone.  Clean the phone's screen very well with supplied cloth and then immediately start applying the protector as to avoid dust from settling on the phone's screen.  Protector scratches easily.

I had two specs of dust, both were handled by the included &#34;Dust Removal Stickers&#34; with ease.  I must say that I can't even tell the protector is there unless I look very close.I did have to switch the pen point on my S-Pen to one of the hard plastic ones (included with Note 3) because the rubberized tip that came installed stuck to the protector when trying to write.

I recently bought a Galaxy Note 3 and was deciding on what to get for a screen protector.  After reviewing several brands and user ratings, I decided to purchase the iSmooth Clear Premium HD protector.  They provide 3 screen protectors and a lifetime warranty.  The package also includes some dust removal stickers and a large cleaning cloth that is the perfect size for the Note 3 screen.  It was fairly easy to apply the first time, and you don't need to use any spray solutions. Just a tip -  Before you begin to unpeel the back plastic sheet off the back, make sure that both sides of the protector are free of any lint and dust particles.  Otherwise when you start peeling the back layer down, some particles may fall on the screen. Work any bubbles from the center out to the sides for best results.  This protector fits perfectly around the home button and edges. If you decide to put a protective case around the phone, the screen protector fits fine with the lip of the case.  The clarity of the screen with the protector is outstanding, and the protector also works fine with the stylus.  Very satisfied and definitely worth the cost.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FDX4U1E" id="B00FDX4U1E-review82" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-26:</strong> Chose this product because I prefer PET screen protectors more than the rubbery kind.

It does have many features that I'll never use, (using the phone on Page Plus Wireless is limited), but it's a nice feature filled phone.

To get around the short battery life, I have disable some of the constant updates that uses data and turn them on only when I need updates.

Flatbed scanners lose track of where they were on the page. Printer servers seem to lose their jobs somewhere in vaporspace. Seriously, her idea of high tech is a digital children's thermometer...A couple years ago, the kids and I helped her migrate from the realm of flip phones to the smart phone world, and the Samsung Illusion is the phone that the kids picked out for her as a birthday gift. It was the right choice for the job -- not too complex, not too many bells & whistles, just the right size for her somewhat petite hands, and easy to navigate. Of course, she jumped head first into texting with family and friends.It took her a few months to put away her paper address book and start to use the phone's Contacts functionality. Took even longer for her to get comfortable using the Illusion to check and send email. Now she's progressed to taking and sharing pictures, reading and sending work files and other pdfs, and using Google Navigator.Yes, she is finally on her way in the smart phone world. Now if she would only get comfortable remembering to take her phone with her wherever she goes, and stop putting it back into her purse (... and then taking it back out again, over & over) each and every time she sends and receives individual texts.One thing that we did notice is that the charge on the original battery lasted, on average, a little over one day. That battery died a few weeks ago, after about two years, and the Samsung OEM replacement purchased on Amazon (Li-Ion Polymer OEM Replacement Battery (1500mAh) for Samsung Illusion (EB484659YZ)) has been fantastic. We think the charge on this one lasts even longer than the initial one did.If you are looking for a good starter smart phone that is reasonably priced and easy to use, we highly recommend that you consider the Samsung Illusion based on our experience with it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006HXJ40G" id="B006HXJ40G-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-28:</strong> Very simple.

I'm happy to finally have a clear screen cover that works. For the past two years I wouldn't even try them, using only the anti-glare covers. Then I would get tired of the anti-glare covers because in my opinion they detracted from the attractiveness of the screen.This cover looks great; you have to look real close to even realize there is a cover on there (wasn't the case with previous clear covers I had used). Boxwave sent me cleaning supplies with the two covers - that made it very easy to apply without getting any dust caught in between.

The side ports include the 3.5mm jack, USB and (bonus) a phone charging port.  There's also a convenient handle on the side opposite to the ports.4) You can use these speakers as a speakerphone.5) The sound quality is excellent, much better than I'd expected in sound quality and volume!6) It's rechargeable and the charge lasts a long time.  And (another bonus) there's an audio indicator for the charge status.I've been a Bose fan for many years and I have a first generation Bose SoundDock that I use almost daily.  So I had the opportunity to compare the two devices side by side playing an iPod track on the Bose and the same track playing off of  Youtube on my tablet on the Jabra.)  I'm biased towards Bose and yet I was impressed with how well the Jabra sounded.  I would not hesitate to use the Jabra in place of the Bose with my iPod at any time.Are there any negatives? Probably just the price.  I was considering getting a SoundDock portable before I got this unit.  It's pricey for sure but it stacks up well, looks nicer than the Bose does, have more capabilities and is easier to carry.  And it will likely stand up better to the weather and is better suited for use around the pool.This is a great product that easily deserves a high rating and a strong recommendation!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-22:</strong> Jabra isn't a name that immediately springs to mind when you think speakers, JBL, Bose, Klipsch maybe but Jabra is a name I know and associate with hands free phone kits.That I suppose makes sense, as this is a Bluetooth portable wireless speaker, that has an excellent WiFi signal pickup compared to others I have tried.It is however, not what I would consider portable by any stretch of the imagination.The unit weighs in at just under 5 pounds, is over 12"x6" in size and pretty cumbersome for backpacking or taking to the beach.It is however weather proof (or at least claims to be) so will be great for summer evenings in the backyard grilling out, without worrying about dirt, dust or water resistance.Rechargeable battery is great, and pretty long lasting, main AC power option is also available, and I like the on board cable storage if you are taking this with you.Sound is actually very good, two woofers, and two tweeters give a nice range, and with the bass radiator you can hear the deep tones, and there is little resonance at high volume, it certainly is loud.With accessory port to charge your phone, and compatibility with just about any Bluetooth enabled device it's a nice package.I gave it four stars and not five for two reasons really, first the aforementioned lack of real portability, but second (and mostly) the price. This unit is not cheap, and if one is considering this amount of cost, I would probably pay a little more and go for a Bose or better know actual speaker manufacturer.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-27:</strong> I've been putting this through it's paces and it's really a great speaker though there area  couple annoyances that I have found it sitll is a rather good product overall.The GOOD:excellent clarity of music/voicespowerful speakershas a built in microphone to be able to take calls when listening to music.Charge your cell phone on the go/at the beach.usb can also connect to your computer to be used as external speaker.The bad:the microphone doesn't seem to give excellent quality to the other person on the other end until you are within a foot of it. outside of that range it tends to get choppy and not very clear.The button on the top of the device for taking calls needs to be pressed and held in order to initiate voice commands on a galaxy s3 but it often has some odd lag that doesn't allow it to stay active long enough for the voice commands to work...It's heavy...The main annoyance I have is that the microphone is not nearly as good as it should be but that's not enough to really dislike the device. I mostly just use this for music at the office so that I can make the day nicer. I do take some calls though on it so it would be nice to have a better mic on it.The other major issue that I find on it is that if you have it plugged in and then plug in the computer to the USB the device goes nuts and can't establish the fact that it has 2 &#34;power sources&#34; and then it just doesn't work right. So if you like to plug it in when you get home and then want to use it with your laptop at the desk you have to unplug the main power cord and just use the USB. It seems that it would have been much smarter to just put in a simple relay in the device that would prevent it from getting too much power. So if the device is plugged in and USB is connected a simple relay disengages the power supply line (16v) so that it doesn't get too much power.One other issue is the fact that the volume isn't completely controlled via the BlueTooth device connected to it, The main volume has to be set on the speaker and then the bluetooth device can change it's volume separately. It would just be a lot nicer to be able to completely control the volume from the USB device.Also the speakers can get distorted at higher levels, unlike some other bluetooth speakers that I have tried of the last few years.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-16:</strong> So far I have used the speaker system through my MacAir and iphone.

One of our big nice weather pass times is sitting out by the pool with a good book, a good beverage, and good music. Speaker sets like this make it much more convenient to do that.Last June I selected and reviewed an NYNE NB-230 Bluetooth speaker which is much less expensive than this Jabra. The critical question is then just how much better is this guy than the less expensive NYNE set?That's a tricky question, but it is better, in some ways MUCH better.First, the Solemate Max without doubt has much more bass output. In fact it is easily the best bass I've ever heard on a speaker of its size. This speaker set is very heavy for the size, and heavy bass makes it vibrate. The bass of course doesn't rival what I get from my tower speakers, but compared to other portable speakers it is most impressive.Second, the Max doesn't lose fidelity at high volumes. The music stays crisp and undistorted. This remains true even with the source device volume AND the speaker's volume all the way up.Third, mid and high range reproduction is very good. I have a little mix I created of the theme from "The Princess Bride" which I started off with part of the sword fight at the top of the cliff. The clash of steel on steel actually sounded better from this little guy than it does from my home theater system. The one caveat here is that from some angles close to the Max, the mid-range tones sound a touch muddy. However, if you back off a few feet, it sounds great. Obviously it needs a little acoustics help, but that help is easy to give it ... just a little space. :-) I have not yet tried the app which goes along with this (it includes an equalizer) but that may also help this minor shortcoming.NOTE: I tried to install the app, but it needs a version of iPad ios that is beyond my first generation iPad ... so no joy there. :-( I also could not find a way to add their Android version of the app to my Kindle Fire HD, although I do have a separate equalizer app from a FAotD a few months back.Once of the things I REALLY like about this speaker is that it is rechargeable. That's getting to be a standard feature of speakers like this, but it wasn't a few years ago when I first started to look for them. Not only is it rechargeable, it will also recharge your portable device when it is connected via USB ... not an essential feature but it is something that could come in handy on occasion.Connecting via Bluetooth is a snap. Press the power switch all the way up and hold it for three seconds. Tap connect on your device ... done. The Max even has a sexy voice prompt to let you know what is going on, and that you are successfully connected.You can also connect to it from the headphone jack, and it includes a cable which cleverly works around the base of the Max for convenient storage. However, when you use the headphone cable, you will need to turn up the volume on the Max CONSIDERABLY over using Bluetooth for some reason. You can still get the same volume levels from both connection methods, you just have to adjust when you make the switch.As I mention volume, the Max does put out an impressive amount of volume when you crank it all the way up. Like all good portable speakers, it beeps to let you know when you have maxed out the volume so that you don't try to wear out the + control.In addition to volume controls, you also have Pause/Play and Skip Forward/Back controls right on the speaker. It will also work as a hands free device for your phone.A USB (cable also included) connection to your computer will let the Max serve as computer speakers too, so that you can play content directly from your desktop at home, or a notebook on the go.The Max has a thick and sturdy rubber base which is removable. The base acts as a buffer to keep the Max from walking off a table or countertop as the bass vibrates it.The Max will now be my speaker set of choice for our portable music listening needs.I'm impressed with this product. I think a lot of thought went into the design, and solid engineering went into the specs.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-26:</strong> I have a few wireless and Bluetooth speaker set-ups and I can't really say that this is better or worse than others.  The charging capability for your device is a positive, and the NFC capability is kind of a neat trick for Android phones.To a large degree, though, it comes down to the sound and, honestly, sub-par.  It's not bad and, actually, fairly good.  But I have a Bose wireless speaker that's a couple of years old and I just expected better out of this, particularly because it has more speakers.  It just sounded a bit muffled, not terribly and not enough to say, &#34;Don't buy this,&#34; but the sound quality is not going to knock your socks off.I did like the ease of connecting it and the little automated voice prompt to tell me I was connected.  I like the look of it.  Is it worth $400?  I'd like to say yes.  If it sounded a little better, I'd be saying YES!  I'd challenge the overall resistance it has to the elements, but assuming it's rugged enough to take outdoors frequently, if that's your gig, I do think it's worth $400.  Beyond that, maybe, wait for a price drop.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-20:</strong> SoleMate Max Bluetooth SpeakerManufacturer: JabraAmazon price: $399.00Two tweeters, two woofers, and a passive radiator combine to produce stunning sound quality from a rugged and portable unit. Turn it on, pair it with your smartphone or iPad, and have access to all of your music, audio from movies and YouTube, as well as your streaming music services.The SoleMate Max includes a registration code for the Jabra Sound App. Download and install it on your phone and you'll have additional control with an equalizer and Dolby Sound Space technology. Overall bass response has been customized by Jabra's sound engineers and it sounds good for most music but if you need to back it off a bit, the equalizer will come in handy.This unit contains a really good rechargeable battery. You'll get about 14 hours of use on a charge. That's impressive. If you are listening to music from your phone and a call comes in, the SoleMate Max pauses so you can answer via a built-in mic. The speakerphone sound quality is really good.There are several ways to play music from the SoleMate Max. Press upward on the On/Off switch to get to the Bluetooth pairing mode. You'll hear voice-guided instructions. I was connected in seconds. Bluetooth stays connected within 30 foot radius. If you have an NFC device, just tap it on the target on the right side of the unit and a connection is established. Built into a groove in the rubber sole of the unit, is a two-foot cable with 3.5MM plugs at each end. Use it to connect the SoleMate Max to any device with an audio-out socket. Because there is a built-in USB port on the unit, you can connect directly to a Mac or PC for sound output.The SoleMate Max is really rugged. Jabra claims that it is dust and splash resistant, and with the thick rubber tread on its base, it will take the bumps and bruises of portability and outdoor use. The rubber base keeps the unit from rattling on the table when the bass is heavy. Thanks to its tidy, subdued design, the unit also looks tailored and elegant indoors. There is even a USB port on the side that allows you to charge your phone from the unit. A small point: there is a flexible silicone carrying handle on the left side of the SoleMate Max. I'd be happier if it was removable as it detracts a bit from the unit's sleek look when it's in our living room.I am a music fan and listen to a wide assortment of genres: Pop, Classical, Bluegrass, Opera, and Rock. In addition, I subscribe to several podcasts. The sonic quality in nearly all cases is excellent, room-filling, and immensely satisfying. Crank the volume and things get loud without distortion.There has been long a string of Bluetooth speakers that have made appearances over the past few years and they range from barely adequate to pretty darned good. The big, spectacular sound that the SoleMate Max produces totally eclipses these predecessors. The first time you turn this unit on, you'll be astonished with the presence and well-balanced sound spectrum. You'll find yourself rediscovering your existing music collection all over again.If you can manage the rather steep price, this is a truly superior speaker system. You get what you pay for, and with the SoleMate Max, you get a lot. Highly recommended.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-05:</strong> Setup is easy, just connect it and flip a switch.I use the Jabra Solemate Max to play music from my mobile devices (iPhone, iPad).

Jabra thought of just about everything when designing a Bluetooth speaker.  It has everything anyone has ever asked for: portability, weather-proof durability, decent sound, wire/wireless operation including NFC, speakerphone.  The question is whether they managed to do it all well?First, the sound quality is decent.  The lows are not that earth shattering. It&#8217;s what you would expect from &#60; 3&#8221; drivers.  There&#8217;s only so much you can do as simple physics takes over. Mids and highs are clear, not tinny like some of the cheaper speakers.  Overall, the sound is a 3.5 out of 5.The paring is easy and rock solid. I haven&#8217;t experienced any dropped connection unlike a Belkin Bluetooth wireless stereo connector that I own.  The Solemate will sleep requiring you to reconnect the next time your device is near it.  Once your device has paired with the Solemate, your device will retain the selection on your device so you&#8217;ll only need to select the Solemate on your device the next time you want to connect.  You may have to first toggle the Solemate on as it goes to sleep after it&#8217;s disconnected for a period of time.The speakerphone is a nice feature but not entirely effective.  The sounds from the speaker is fine but the receiver on the other end will have a hard time hearing the caller as the noise filtering microphone is not loud enough.  You&#8217;ll have to shout or get really close to the Solemate if you want to be heard.  To use the speakphone is easy, once you&#8217;re connected just dial your number on your phone and you&#8217;ll be able to select the Solemate as your choice.You can also recharge your other devices using the built in USB connection. The battery itself doesn&#8217;t seem that large in capacity.  There are no specs regarding the mAh of the battery so there&#8217;s no way to tell how much juice you have to recharge another device.The design of the integrated cable for connecting any device by wire is ingenious. You&#8217;ll always have the cable with you as it&#8217;s tucked neatly on the bottom of the speaker. You can see it in the photo.  It&#8217;s the yellow cord that&#8217;s wrapped inside the bottom cover. It has male 3.5 mm jacks on both ends.I don&#8217;t have a NFC enabled devise so I can&#8217;t really test that function.  In addition I didn&#8217;t download their app to utilize the Dolby Surround function.Overall, it&#8217;s a decent unit that reminds me of the boom-boxes from the 80&#8217;s. It can get decent volume but don&#8217;t expect tremendous range in the low end. I think it&#8217;s a bit expensive for what it does.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-25:</strong> The Jabra Solemate Max is an amazing little speaker with big sound.

I am contrasting all 4 speakers here.(note I will be adding the Bose Soundlink 3 information in the coming days, after I test it more [UPDATE: added information on the Soundlink 3)Sound Quality------------------Surprisingly the Soundlink mini has the best sound. Unfortunately, you can't really crank it too high due to its small size. But it stood out slightly as the more clear sound of all 4 speakers.1. Sound link mini2. Tie between Jabra and Bose Soundlink 2 and 3Sound Volume------------------All three can be cranked up to their highest setting without distortion, which is quite surprising.1. Jabra Max has the highest volume of the 4.2. Soundlink 3 (very close to Jabra)3. Soundlink 2 is close behind (almost as loud as the 3)4. Sounlink miniConstruction Quality:--------------------------This is a 4 way tie. All43 are exceptional made, though very different.In no particular order:The Soundlink mini has a great aluminum construction, reminiscent of apple macbook pros.The Soundlink 2 has a built in cover, which can be used conveniently as a stand, it is solidly built hard plastic shell (good quality).The Soundlink 3 looks a bit like the Jabra, with the size of the 2.The Solemate has a more rugged construction. Instead of exposed aluminum or hard plastic, it has a rubbery feel on a very strong foundation. It doesn't have a built in case, thought they sell cases for it.Size:------1. Soundlink mini is significantly smaller.2. Bose Soundlink is an in-between size of these two. Both the sound link 2 and the sound link 3 are almost the same size.3. The Solemate max is a big speaker, it is roughly 3 times the volume of the Soundlink 2. Longer, thicker and just as tall.Weather/Water--------------------1. Jabra definitely has the edge here. The rubber construction and everything about it, is made to withstand some weather. It is said to be dust and water resistant (not water proof!!!), the buttons do not protrude like the others, but rest underneath the rubber layer. Despite that they are easy to click. This is the one to get if you are going to the beach. The rubber construction also allows it to take a fall and not miss a beat.2. Tie. Neither Bose speaker is something I'd want to bump too much. The aluminum of the mini might be a tad more durable, but neither offers any protection against the weather.Battery Life:---------------1. Jabra has a longer battery life, closer to 14 depending on volume. Tied with the Soundlink 3.2. Soundlink 2 and mini both have the same around 7 hour life.Speaker phone/mic-------------------1. Jabra can be used to answer phone calls and talk as a speaker phone.2. None of the 3 Bose speakers can do this.Price:-------1. Soundlink mini and the Sounlink 2 tie for first place. While the mini is about $70 cheaper, it doesn't come with a built in case, and the output volume does not get very high, so I give it equal value.2. The Sounlink 3, is $30 dollars more than the Soundlink 2, but doesn't have a built in cover ($additional $40 value to get one now)  and it doesn't improve much over the Soundlink 2 other than a longer battery life.3. The Jabra is close to $400, and at that price point its hard to justify over the competition given that it doesn't have any advantage over them, except if you truly value rugged design and will be taking it to a lot of beach trips.Bluetooth pairing:-----------------------1. Jabra takes first place here. It is extremely easy to pair. And it speaks to you when it does: "Connected". I tried from my phone and my computer and both connected easily and flawlessly. Turning the phone bluetooth on or off, coming a day later, it doesn't matter, it's just a matter of selecting the Jabra speaker from the list of options and it connects. No extra work needed.2. All 3 Bose speakers act the same way. Connection and pairing is easy, but most of the time when you want to connect again (a day later, or after disabling bluetooth to save on cell battery for a bit) you need to go to the speaker and click on the bluetooth icon to again make it available to be connected to. *Most of the time*  Some people might have more success but for me, most of the time I needed to do this. It wouldn't just connect when I selected Bose from the drop down like it does for the Jabra system.NFC------1. Jabra has NFC, which means some cellphones can connect to it with a simple tap. That's great.2. Bose still hasn't put NFC on any of their products, including the just released Soundlink 3.Overall, I am disappointed on Jabra. The package underwhelms in most ways except ruggedness.It's much larger than Bose but has the same battery life and virtually the same sound output as the smaller sound link 3. The sound quality is virtually identical to the Soundlink 2/3 as well. The addition of a speaker phone might be useful to some, but I have a hard time justifying the $400 price tag compared to $270 or $299 of the Bose Soundlink systems.If it were the same price as the Soundlink I would have given it 4 stars, but as it stands, it's asking significantly more money than competing products, while not bringing enough value in return and being larger/heavier.That said - it is not a bad system, it's just not priced correctly. If you do plan on going to the beach a lot and using it in adverse weather, than the extra cost might be worth it. Otherwise you're better off with the smaller and equally good sounding Bose.note:If you don't care about high volume, the Bose Soundlink mini has the best sound of the bunch but probably just for a small office in quiet area.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-28:</strong> The Jabra Solemate Max does put out a big sound. For the price (currently $399 on Amazon), it really should. I think it gets a little louder than the only other bluetooth speaker I have access to, the Bose Soundlink Mini, but it is twice the price. This speaker should put out a better sound, as it is not only more expensive but considerably larger and heavier. This speaker is able to keep its clarity very well while cranking the sound to the max.The first thing you notice when you get this speaker is the heft. It is very portable, but you will notice that you're lugging it to wherever it is you're going (at least in comparison to other speakers). The handle is a very nice feature, though, and is very comfortable.Hooking this up to your phone or iPod via bluetooth is extremely easy. You hold the power button up for about three seconds, then the speaker will instruct you to connect with your phone. It will also indicate when you have established a connection, leaving any doubt out of the equation. You can also use a headphone jack to connect this speaker, which could come in handy when you want to use this with a hotel's TV, for instance. You can also connect this speaker with a USB cable, which I have not tried. I assume that is very easy to set up, though. The bluetooth connection has worked very well for me. There has been no lost connections so far, and everything has played very well.Jabra also has two cheaper models, so it's not fair to compare this directly to the Soundlink Mini. This was designed to put out a bigger sound, and I think it accomplishes it. There are also fringe benefits like being able to charge your phone with the speaker's USB port. The rechargeable battery is supposed to last twice as long; so far, I haven't run out. I should be getting pretty close, I think, but I haven't been keeping exact count. It seems like I have to charge the Soundlink Mini way more often, even if it's been in standby mode.Overall, this thing is very user-friendly and puts out a great sound. If you're looking for a top-of-the-line bluetooth speaker, this is a good one to choose. It appears to be very well made, and should hold up quite well while being lugged around.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-24:</strong> I love to take music on the go.

I like to use this for watching movies on my laptop since it delivers an immersive, big and loud stereo sound in the room, that brings movies more to life than when listening to them via the small installed speakers. (This really would be good enough for a home theater speaker system in a small to medium-sized room.)These speakers are heavy, and feel like they're built very solidly. There are woofers, and tweeters and a built-in bass. Certainly they sound like it. You can hear the entire range of sound and it isn't muddled. There's also a protective rubber casing on the bottom and top so that it would be easy to take them outdoors. There's a handle for convenience of carrying.They plug in to the wall for charging, and can run from the wall plug. You can also use the built-in batteries.This would be great for a beach or pool party or a barbecue outdoors, and you could use it to DJ a medium-sized house party from your phone. Easy to use, sounds great. Highly recommended.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-20:</strong> This device is pure awesomeness.  I was expecting something good and solid but I am not sure I expected anything this great.To start it is heavy.  I mean really heavy compared to its small shoe box size.  I am not sure that is really an issue.  I think it does a few things.  It holds a large battery (good!) and reduces body vibration which is also good.  The device is slightly sloped, via the rubberized and grooved base, to point up and angle the sound and top control panel.  The synching of the bluetooth and cable is simple and very, very easy.  So far the power has lasted a long time in standby.  Best of all the sound is great.  I mean I don't know how such a small device could sound any better.  And it is LOUD!  Wow, is it loud.  No worries here.  Take it outside or in a group.  You will hear it no problem.  Oh, and as an added benefit you can charge from the device to power, via USB, your phone or MP3 player.Pros:Solid buildGreat soundVery loudGood battery lifeQuick chargeEasy controlsEasy SynchTravel handleCons:Heavy (although this has advantages)A really great device!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-25:</strong> Jabra has a pretty good reputation of making quality sounding Bluetooth speakers: the Solemate and the Solemate Mini are both popular, excellent sounding Bluetooth speakers.The Solemate Max is the big brother Bluetooth speaker from Jabra, and this speaker certainly lives up to its name, both in size and in sound. The Max is the biggest speaker of the Jabra line, measuring 13.8 x 5.8 x 5.8 inches and weighing more than seven pounds. With that size, however, comes the ability to deliver room-filling sound. The Solemate Max has two tweeters, two woofers and a custom-designed proprietary bass that delivers very clear and crisp lows.I tested the Solemate Max with all different types of music, from classical to jazz, to rock and rhythm and blues and even disco. The Solemate Max performed very well, delivering crisp highs and resonant lows. Because the Solemate Max produces enough sound to easily fill a large room it would be perfect for parties or events with lots of people.Jabra also has an app (for both iOS and Android devices) that acts as a music player for your device. The Jabra Sound App (you need a specific code, which Jabra provides in the box, to activate the app) allows you to customize the sound with an equalizer and Dolby sound). The equalizer has a number of pre-sets and gives you the ability to create, but not save, a custom preset). I tried the app on both my iPod Touch and Android devices. The app works reasonably well but on a few occasions the sound dropped when I was using the app with my Android MP3 player. If you already have a music player on your device (such as Equalizer or Poweramp) or if you are happy with the stock equalizer you may not need to use the app.In addition to producing great sound the Solemate Max also has Near Field Communication (NFC), so you can connect your phone to the speaker by tapping it, built-in speakerphone capabilities, Jabra's integrated cable (located at the "sole" of the speaker, making it hard to lose), a battery rated at providing 14 hours of talk time/music time, a USB connector and a phone charging port. The speaker also has a carry strap and because of its size and weight seems very durable. The Max is also dirt and splash resistant. Pairing the speaker with a device is simple: just hold the pairing button up for about four seconds and you get voice prompts to help you pair your device.I own a number of Bluetooth speakers and usually list the TDK-A33 and Ultimate Ears Boom as my favorites. Both produce very good sound but are much smaller than the Solemate Max, which is made to compete with higher priced speakers from Bose, Klipsch, and even the Sonos line of multi-room speaker systems.I highly recommend the Jabra Solemate Max. While not inexpensive, these days most people no longer use expensive multi-component sound systems and rely on music from small, portable devices. A speaker that produces quality, room-filling sound is important, especially if you enjoy listening to different types of music or consider music a hobby. The Jabra Solemate Max produces excellent, room-filling, well-balanced sound and has other features (such as the ability to charge your phone, and a long-lasting battery) that makes this a premium Bluetooth speaker.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-24:</strong> - The battery life is long. I was able to play music through it all day before having to charge it up again.- It's extremely portable. There's a nice soft handle to grab and it runs on batteries, so you could potentially take it wherever you go, keeping in mind you'll need to charge it eventually.- It's dirt, dust, and water-resistant.- The Bluetooth pairing is amazingly easy. I was able to pair it with an iPod, iPhone, and two computers in only a few minutes (though Bluetooth technology only really works with one at a time!).- It's charged straight out of the box.- Music plays with a lot of clarity; what you'd expect for a $400 device. It produces a pleasant &#34;all around&#34; sound with a nice range of highs and lows. The bass sounds great if you put it on the floor.- It will actually charge your phone if your phone is plugged into it. Nice little detail.- You'll notice in one of the product photos that it is slanted. It actually &#34;looks up&#34; at you.- Thanks to its soft casing, it will never scratch anything you place it on.- It gets LOUD.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review21" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-02:</strong> Hooking up this device to an I phone was just so easy.  The Bluetooth connection was very simple to do.  The free Jabra software downloaded quickly and the connection itself was as automatic as they get.The sound is great.  Looking forward to using this at the pool since it is sturdy enough to be good for that.  The handle makes them very easy to carry around and use in different locations.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review22" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-22:</strong> I'd like to say off the bat that the Solemate MAX *is* expensive, but give it a few months and it will surely drop in price.Like the other reviewers have mentioned, I was not expecting Jabra to produce a Bluetooth stereo system, but I guess it makes sense since they produce other Bluetooth accessories such as BT headsets.The Solemate Max is solidly constructed.  It comes with a floppy carrying loop/handle for portability.  The handle felt securely attached during transportation.  The speaker is not heavy, weighing around five pounds.  It has a rugged looking veneer, fingerprint-proof material, and rubberer-ized bottom which prevents slippage.Pairing with my phone could not have been more straightforward.  I was unable to connect via NFC due to problems with my Galaxy S3, but Bluetooth pairing was very easy and took all of three seconds to finish.  The pairing process was further aided by verbal directions- brilliant!  Although a USB input port is provided, I was disappointed that it did not support playing music off of a USB stick.  Instead, the USB port is for connecting to a computer.Sound quality was very good for jazz and classical music, but lacking in bass.  Changing the equalizer settings on my phone helped, but for $400, Jabra can do better.  Although it was not immediately obvious, the volume +/- buttons on the Solemate were of marginal utility.  Use the volume buttons on your phone or other connected device to control the volume.  I installed the Jabra Sound App, but could not hear any discernible benefit in sound quality so I uninstalled it.  If you have other Jabra BT devices, the app enables control of those as well.  If an incoming call comes thru on the phone, the Solemate pauses the music and transforms into a giant speakerphone.  It worked flawlessly!  Once my call finished, it reverted back to playing music again.In conclusion, the Solemate is a solidly performing Bluetooth speaker.  I've only given it four stars because it ought to have better bass at this price point.  Additionally, the lack of USB stick functionality was disappointing.  If the price drops, I'll upgrade the rating.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review23" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-24:</strong> When I first saw the picture of this Jabra stereo with a handle, I thought it was going to be very lightweight.  Thus, I was surprised when I first picked it up and realized it weighed over five pounds.  But in my opinion, any electronic product that is heavy is well-made!  It's also versatile when it comes to connecting devices.  There's Bluetooth and it is extremely simple to connect with Bluetooth.  The Bluetooth even talks to you while connecting.  I just turned it on, went to my phone and turned on the Bluetooth and chose the "device list" setting, and the phone quickly found the Jabra.  I then used another phone to call my phone, and the ringing came in loud and clear over the Jabra speakers. If you use your phone as an alarm clock, the alarm clock sound will also come in loud and clear over the speakers.  My phone is not even a SmartPhone, but a flip phone with Bluetooth. You can also charge your phone with the included USB cord.Connecting my iPod was also simple, although I unfortunately don't have Bluetooth, since I have an iPod Classic.  (That's the one thing I wish they'd add to the Classic--Bluetooth! It needs nothing else but that.)  To connect I used the included 3.5mm cord.  That cord is neatly stored on the bottom of the Jabra, so it's always there. The iPod music sounds very good coming out of the Jabra speaker, but make sure you check your EQ settings on the iPod if you don't think it sounds good.  Like all portable speakers I've ever tried, the equalizer setting greatly determines what you hear from the speakers.  I like heavy treble, and "spoken word" or "treble booster" worked great on this Jabra speaker.  I connected the iPod charge cord to the USB port on the Jabra to see if it would charge the iPod, and it did not, but it never said in the directions it would. Also none of the top buttons worked with the iPod, except the volume ones.  The fast forward and reverse buttons did not. I'm not sure what device those buttons control. I have no music on my phone to test to see if it's a phone alone they control. They didn't work with my laptop while playing music, either, although connecting to my laptop was also easy using the included USB cord. I used my Amazon Cloud player to play music with the laptop and that sounded very nice. Also, I noticed my Tosiba Sattelite laptop has an equalizer, too, which I haven't played with yet.Compared to theSony SRSBTX500 Portable NFC Bluetooth Wireless Premium Speaker System, which I also have, this Jabra is slightly shorter and heavier.  The sound of the Jabra is also more a treble sound, while the Sony has more bass.  (Once again, however, what your equalizer is on greatly affects the sound.) The one shortcoming of the Jabra is the volume gets lower when playing songs that are softer, and songs that are older ones remastered.  I never noticed this before I compared it to the Sony.  I have to actually turn the volume up on the iPod or the Jabra for those type of songs.  The Sony always keeps a consistent volume level.  The Sony is not as ruggedly built as the Jabra, though, and has no carry handle, only a soft travel case.  I never take the Sony out of the house.  This Jabra I'll have no problem taking places, like myEton Soulra XL Solar Powered Sound System for iPod and iPhone - (NSP500B).  The Eton has a shoulder strap for carrying, the Jabra has its handle. The Eton charges an iPod, but is an older non-Bluetooth model.  This Jabra is brand new, and will probably have lots of fans.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-25:</strong> This speaker system is perfect for our home Gym and our outside patio area.

Here&#8217;s my report on it.Out of the box it&#8217;s a sturdy, handsome unit with a durable grey metal mesh and black trim with a rubberized carry handle at one end for easy transport. On the opposite end is a charging LED, the On/Off/Pairing switch, a 3.5mm jack, a mini USB port and a full-sized USB port for phone charging. On top are the controls: a Play/Pause with volume control and a skip forward and skip reverse. Another button shows the battery status while serving as an Answer/End control. A cable stores neatly into the underside.What is inside is nothing short of amazing. Two tweeters and two powerful woofers with a bass radiator deliver big, extraordinarily clear sound. I have a Bose Wave radio in my kitchen, and it sounds good, but when I play podcasts or music from Pandora on the Jabra, it sounds even better. That&#8217;s saying something for a smallish portable unit. I&#8217;ve put it through the paces with a variety of music from Baroque brass to Renaissance lute, and it picks up every nuance. I&#8217;ve even used it outdoors in my greenhouse and delighted in the crisp, clear sounds. An added plus for that location is that it&#8217;s dirt, dust and water resistant.The Soulmate Max&#8217;s rechargeable battery life is great: fourteen hours for music or talk and up to 130 days standby time (of course I haven&#8217;t had it long enough to actually test the standby time). It takes about 2.5 hours for a full charge, however, it can be used while charging as well.I paired it to my phone which, although not a smartphone, does have Bluetooth capability and a memory card with an extensive playlist. I mainly use it with my Kindle Fire (alas, not Bluetooth enabled) to listen to podcasts and Pandora Radio. I have not tested it with my cellphone because I live in an area with no cell reception.Using the Jabra sound app gives the added boost of Dolby technology for the ultimate in sound experience.There are four ways to connect to your music or sound:Option 1: Hold the on/off switch in the up position for 3 seconds. Pairing mode will be announced, and the Bluetooth light will flash. Follow the voice-guided pairing instrutions. You don&#8217;t have to have your Kindle near the unit; you&#8217;ll get high quality audio from any Bluetooth device up to a distance of 33 feet. Option 2: Enable NFC on your mobile device. Locate and gently tap the NFC zone on themobile device against the NFC zone on the Jabra Solemate Max. Option 3: Use the cable located in the bottom of the sole to plug directly into a 3. 5mm audio jack. Option 4: Find a free USB slot on your PC and plug in the micro USB cable. This way you can set the Jabra Solemate Max as the default audio device under &#8216;Sound and Audio devices&#8217; in your operating system. I have a set of Logitech speakers for my desktop, but adding the Jabra Soulmate Max ramped up the sound quality for watching Netflix movies and Torrent downloads.All in all, it&#8217;s an attractive, ruggedly built speaker system with fantastic sound and so portable. I love it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00FX6LRG2" id="B00FX6LRG2-review26" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-27:</strong> The Jabra SOLEMATE MAX Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Speakers provide awesome sound in a relatively small package.

Setting up the Bluetooth was very easy. The speakers have multiple methods of connection so you will definitely find a way to connect even if you do not have Bluetooth.

I think for vehicle application it probably has a niche as it would be better suited for dash installation as the arm is quite short as the device specs state.  I did want a short reach cradle as I am using this as a desktop application. I bought a ceramic, smooth tile, felted the bottom and suctioned the cradle on. For that it is perfect.However, in either application I am weary of the design of the clip. Check out the ample pics from a previous buyer, the slide contraption relies on a slide and rail with a spring for torque. At rest the opening is just at 2", may be a hair less.I am using a Samsung Galaxy S3 with Elago Slim Fit case and it measures 2 7/8" together. This is the absolute max opening of the dock! So it just fits. Lose the case and you gain maybe a 1/16th of an inch. Removing the spring from the cradle (very simple to do) and the opening slides to 3 1/4"! So it has the room, it is just the spring is too long/too or too tight. The spring is very stiff, so if you are up from some tinkering, you can stretch it out, cut to length and the cradle may indeed be adequate to suit your needs.At stock setting, getting the phone in is not so bad, there are no finger rests to squeeze the slide down the rail to open the grips; getting it out is another story. Since the slide is at max opening already one has to squeeze the last 1/2 mm out of the spring and slide the phone down and out of the grips. In a car I would see this near impossible with the steering wheel in the way.Even with the case off, I would say nearly impossible to tilt or twist and pull the phone out, at least not in a manner that makes you feel comfortable doing it, so it is still best to slide the phone out from the bottom. One thing to note is the opposite side of the slide and rail setup is stationary. The plastic is hard so no flex there.Another complaint is that the grips are pretty deep so accessing the screen you are forced to come straight in instead of slightly at an angle. In a vehicle this may be an issue, for me and my application, I just twist the coaster contraption I made.While the dock/cradle is able to rotate at 360 degrees, it takes some force to do it. Your device definitely won't lose it's position, but I fear trying to adjust the angle will wear out the ball and joint tension prematurely or just break in the process. As stated by others it takes some good force to snap it in to begin with.For my vehicle I use the Kensington Quick-Release Car Mount. It is made for the iPhone's but works on other models. I have used a Droid Razr, Droid Razr Maxx and now the S3. The S3 is defintely the tightest fit, still more wiggle room than the Arkon being reviewed. A friend uses the S4 with Otterbox Defender. It fit until he tried taking it out, then broke it, so at least you know the limits.I highly recommend that car mount, it has easy one hand in and out operation, as both sides are spring loaded in a chip-clip style, the grips do not obstruct and it has 180 degree range of motion with click stops, so it can be tailored to your liking. A long adjustable arm, and good suction.At the time of writing the Kensington is twice the price as the Arkon being reviewed, so I guess the old adage is true...you get what you pay for.IMO: I think the manufactuers are still trying to keep these devices universal, but since the average screen size is now 4.5" for a smartphone the width is a bit more, especially when adding a case.You could ask why I didn't buy a charging dock instead? Because this was cheaper, would hold the phone, and I don't have to have it on charge all the time...and I'm cheap.That's my 2 cents and unlike the guy from the Dos Equis commercial, mine may actually cost you money!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005EPNSKK" id="B005EPNSKK-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-29:</strong> So far it's holding up pretty well, the grip is a little tight and I'm trying to find something to put in there so it doesn't keep choking my phone and becomes easier to pull out my cell phone.

Need to navigate to the store and don't have a charger? Don't worry about it. Want to watch some Netflix? Not a problem. Definitely better than the constant hunt for a charger.

I'm a serious power user, and after a year the stock battery was having trouble keeping a charge. I'd charge my phone to full, use it for a few minutes, and suddenly get a "50%" warning. Time to do a replacement.And replacement isn't easy anymore. In the race to make absurdly thin devices, manufacturers have resorted to making phones designed not to be opened. I got my Razr for the awesome battery, and frankly I find it too thin for comfort, but that's another review. Long story short- pry off the back cover, use T3 and T5 bits to get all the screws out, pry off the front cover, and you can change the battery on the Maxx. Mild to medium hardware experience preferred, but not required.The battery itself is excellent, and seems to have my phone back to stock. Performance of my apps also seems radically increased now that the phone isn't going crazy trying to figure out whether it has power. The battery I got even seems a tiny bit thinner than stock- I wonder if there was a revision at some point. It seems lighter too, likely thanks to the lack of all the glue the stock battery has to try and stop you from removing it.So I got a better-than-stock replacement for the Droid Razr Maxx. Battery is also compatible with the original Razr (instant upgrade to Maxx), and apparently the Atrix as well.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008I66GB0" id="B008I66GB0-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-31:</strong> Honestly this was like the best decision I made. Juice would run out after 10hrs of barely any use - just checking emails etc. If I actually used the phone it would die in 6-8hrs. Shipping was fast. Battery was pristine. Watch the YouTube videos, keywords &#34;EB40 Atrix HD&#34; and there is a video with sound that walks you through it. Do not attempt without a T5 Screwdriver, $5.00 on Amazon. There are a lot of screws. Once everything hooked up, just position the battery as low as possible so that it doesn't interfere with the Speaker, as it is part of the inner assembly. Because the battery is double the size, if the battery is too far up the speaker won't work. But get everything situation and voila, a new phone that lasts 40 hrs if very light use. Awesome! It does make the case bulk out a little but very little, and also make the phone heavier but small price to pay for such convenience of not needing to charge it so often.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008I66GB0" id="B008I66GB0-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-04:</strong> I ordered this, and it was defective (it was all the way dis-charged, which makes it not work again).The return was quick, and I ordered the same battery from another seller, (it was also $15 less!)The battery fit perfect (both times, since it's the same battery).My old battery was damaged when the idiot owner (me) decided that the phone freezing up and not turning off or anything was unacceptable, and severed the battery ribbon cable when taking it apart.The new battery functions flawlessly, and works just like it should.The phone itself, may have had one of three possible reasons for the freezing/failure:1.  It was on a windshield mount, which allows the phone to get very hot in the sun.2.  The microSD card became defective (at some point), and if inserted in anything, causes the adapter/whatever to get hot.  This could have damaged the phone, but it appears fine now.3.  The phone was rooted and had lots of applications on it, and was used for well over a year, without any &#34;wipe&#34; or resets... like a computer gets slow over time, so do smartphones.All in all, since it's OEM, this was a winner.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B008I66GB0', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B008I66GB0', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B003QXNA28</h2>    <p class="price"> $B003QXNA28</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

Although it is not invisible, I was not worried about that.  I wanted something that protected my phone from scratches and smudges, etc.  This certainly does protect my phone from scratches.  And that is all it does.I didn't care it was a different touch experience.  However, it did bother me a lot after the first week when this "protector" got dirty.  I am very, very careful and my previous cell phones were never scratched or dirty.  I take excellent care of them and when I am done with them, I can sell them for a good price.I could not clean this thing out of the phone.  After that, it started making little bubbles.  I decided to take it back to the mall for exchange or to get cleaned and "unbubbled".  The lady took the bubbles out and did try to clean it but she was not able to do so.To make a long story short, I have a worthless piece of plastic that is way too expensive.  The woman at the mall's kiosk told me the cover could be replaced for $5.00. NO WAY!!!! I had already paid over $20.00 with the installation.  OK, I don't know what I am going to do with this.  I will throw it away because it is my only choice.

With the dry kit, it's more difficult than even a standard screen protector to apply (and we all know that those can be a royal pain in the rear!).  And since their warranty doesn't cover errors in application, you have to get it perfect or you're out a lot of cash for a ruined protector.Once you get it on, the display quality on the iPhone 4S is degraded quite a bit due to the texture of the screen protector.  It has a reptilian feel to it, rather than being smooth.  This texture is visible when you're looking at the display, and it negates the Retina display quality.  However, the texture *does* make the back of the phone easier to hold onto.If you want something that'll make the back of your phone easier to hold onto and grip, that will get rid of the slippery feeling of the bare iPhone, and will protect the back of your phone from scratches without changing the look of your phone much, then grab this and just apply the back portion.  The front will likely bug the heck out of you, though. :)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003QXNA28" id="B003QXNA28-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-07-16:</strong> First let me start by saying that I have used Zagg invisishield on my previous iphone 3g and 3gs. Both were very superior to this crap they're pushing out now. Seems everyone rushed to get the product out for the iphone 4 release, and put they're reputations at risk.This product whlie it does fit exactly to the phone, it just won't stay put. I,ve applied the invisishield to all my kids iphone 3g's and mine and was very pleased with them. They took a beating before they showed any signs of wear. Not with this iphone 4 shield. I applied the full body protection to both my iphone 4 and my son's. They went on easy, no bubbles, the problem is the adhesive is obviously not string enough or never dries. Whatever the reason, they silde off with the slightest movement. Forget about putting the phone in your pocket or a case, because the shield will peel right off.Now for the sad part. It seems Zagg is following in Apples foot steps claiming there is no problem with the shield, and blame it on applying error. That is just BS. Sure they'll replace it for free, but you have to pay for the shipping, packaging, gas and time to take it to the shipper, etc. In other words, they know they're getting very few back. The cost to produce these has to be next to nothing when you poduce in the volume they do. They can easily send you a replacement free without any of the above hassles.While they did respond to my e-mail, because like another reviewer said, you won't get them on the phone, they agreed to a ONE TIME REPLACEMENT!, providing I followed the above procedure. That's mighty nice of them isn't it.I got news for them, with they're CS and lifetime guarantee policy I'll stick to the silicone case for $5.00. It won't peel, won't scratch and will last a lifetime.Save your money and stay away at from this Zagg product.

The Invisible Shield has worked for a Nintendo DSi and the iPhone 3GS.  However, the surface texture of the helicopter glass of the iPhone 4 does not allow for adequate 'bonding' with the shield.  Despite multiple attempts of fixing the shield to the phone, the shield tends to peel from the corners.  Given that the surface is different on the iPhone is no fault of Zagg, though.  It just needs some other method that would be more effective on the long term.Alternative screen shields should work better than this particular product.Not Recommended for the iPhone 4.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003QXNA28" id="B003QXNA28-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-08-05:</strong> I have purchased a Zagg screen for 6 different devices over the years. This is a product where it is absolutely essential that you read and follow the instructions completely. Most of the negative comments are related to not following the directions or not waiting a few days before judging the finished product. Also, it isn't completely invisible - but it will look better in the end than a device with all kinds of scratches on the glass. Consider the alternative to not installing one.1) Install in a dust-free clean area (i.e. clean things up first with an air-can if you have one)2) Wet your fingers gernerously with the spray provided.3) Wait. Once installed it takes a few (2-3) days for the air bubbles to disappear. It will be worth it in the end.4) If you purchase the front and back cover. Install the back first. It will give you some experience when installing the front.5) Enjoy. I sold a device on Ebay and I cannot tell you how perfect the screen was when I ripped the Zagg off. It looked brand new.6) Touch is not significantly affected. I use a stylus tip and my finger with no problems. A little oil from your finger reduces most of the friction.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003QXNA28" id="B003QXNA28-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-17:</strong> This product protects my iPhone 4 very well.it does get dirty after a few months and corners start to come off, but with the lifetime warranty, I'm not worried.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003QXNA28" id="B003QXNA28-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-11:</strong> Good protection for my hubbies iphone, even as a construction man this works.

After a few weeks or days, you will start to notice indentations from everyday use that won't disappear. This degrades the quality of the screen. Don't waste your money on this Gimmick. You are throwing your money away. I don't mind the orange peal effect, but the thing can't seem to stay on. I had the front and back by itself with no case and it came off after 3 weeks at the corners.

The corners did not peal off like the first time, but after a few days, I had these dents that did not go away. Then I went to the Kiosk and bought another new Zagg and had them "professionally" install the front and back (for a fee), and again after about 1 week of very light use, I got dents.

First of all, they give you plenty of solution to do the job right. You must get your fingers wet, and BOTH sides of the protector wet before applying. And yes, you must have your phone off because you are going to be squeegeeing the solution out. I use a tissue pushed into the speaker hole to prevent solution from getting in.The scratch resistance of this thing is remarkable. I have been able to keep one of these on for much longer than other screen protectors. Also, it has a LIFETIME warranty. You pay only shipping each time you want to replace with a new one.I agree that there is a very slight waviness in the surface of the shield, but it does not affect the clarity of the screen.I agree that it is not as slippery as the glass screen, but I found that wiping the surface against my cotton shirt or pants has made it much smoother in just a few days.I purchased the custom back with a family photo printed into the shield. It really customizes the phone.One downside about the fit, is that Zagg has made it so precise to fit right up to the edges of the phone, that when I installed the Apple bumper onto it, it was really tricky to get the bumper to settle down on top of the edge of the shield. Squeezing the bumper sometimes puts a slight bubble on the edge that I have to push down periodically.All in all, I like this screen protector, and I like the idea that I can continually get more for shipping charges only as the screen becomes worn.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003QXNA28" id="B003QXNA28-review26" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-07-06:</strong> I used zagg couple years ago when it was the only one available for iphone protection.But now as we have lots of them for comparison,i didn't like this at all.The front screen protector is not at all invisible.I wanted some thing sharp ,but this is loose and saggy.I mean the screen protector while squeezing the liquid sags and increase in size,so the out of shape when applying.Moreover when back light is not ON,you can see a wave kind of plastic film on the screen.I will post the pictures real soon.But i never recommend this to a friend.I feel my friends Bodyguardz are much better and crisp then this.I should have listened to other reviewers.My BAD.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003QXNA28" id="B003QXNA28-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-26:</strong> When i got this product, it was new yes, how ever it wasn't really the sellers fault i accidently got the dry full body it stuck to everything so i didn't even get to use it, it was a waste of money.......</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003QXNA28" id="B003QXNA28-review28" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-08-27:</strong> excellent protection w/o feeling too bulky.

The orange peel effect takes away the fancy look of an iPhone. Makes it cheap and plastic looking.However, I still use them because of the protection. Provides good protection and does decrease the amount of fingerprints that the screen can attract.For those who are undecided: Dry and wet installations offer the same protection/look. Although, dry is a lot quicker and easier to put on, it is a lot less flexible in terms of removing it or moving it around. If you mess up on a dry installation, that&#8217;s it. With wet, you have more chances to make it right.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003QXNA28" id="B003QXNA28-review30" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-06-30:</strong> This company is ramping all about how their "technology" is patented and unique.

It is a fairly basic case with a few slots on the back that allow you to carry a credit card, ID, or some cash.  Nothing fancy.  It will help to protect your phone from scuffs and scrapes. However, it does not appear that it will provide very much impact protection. Compared with other cases, it is somewhat expensive, but its quality is fine. We installed it on my wife's S4 with no problems. The holes lines up reasonably well, and it doesn't add much bulk.  She prefers it to the basic AmazonBasics TPU case.If you don't need the slots for cards, check out the AmazonBasic TPU case instead.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DR8KSA4" id="B00DR8KSA4-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-30:</strong> The case fit my Galaxy S4 (standard not Active) perfectly.  The buttons are also all covered but still responsive.  Plenty of space at the USB port for charging even with my older Samsung plug that is wider and thicker than the new ones.It did come with an added, and unexpected, bonus.  A lens cleaning cloth.  Handy to not only clean the phone but also my eye glasses.  I couldn't figure out how to get it into the card slot but then I took the Q card they supplied as an card slot insert and wrapped the cloth around that and into the slot it went.Certainly one advantage of the card slot will be on my business travel and a handy place to keep the hotel room key.  This way I don't have to go searching through my wallet searching for the card.Like other reviewers, and one reason I chose this case, is the sound channel that pushes the sound out to the front of the phone.  I've always hated speaker phone mode (on most smartphones I've owned) as the speaker is always on the opposite side and I'm not that young so the hearing is not as good as it used to be.  No more.  Now with the sound coming out of the front I'm actually looking forward to using speaker mode more often.Obviously, with the addition of the card slot the case is slightly thicker.  In my case, short and stubby fingers, I think I actually have a better grip on this phone than without a case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DR8KSA4" id="B00DR8KSA4-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-18:</strong> this case is great.

However it's a very tight squeeze, and you have to fold your cash up into a single small wad. I personally like the bi-fold system so I can quickly extract the bills I need. It can hold 3 credit cards at the most. This might work for a night out when you don't want to bring your wallet, but it's simply not large enough to work as a full time wallet replacement.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DR8KSA4" id="B00DR8KSA4-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-06:</strong> Although this case is designed to carry only the most essential stuff that you need (cellphone, paper money, driver license, and credit card), I typically place it inside my small and versatile Samsonite Excursion Bag, instead of putting the cellphone with the case in my back pocket. One reason for this is for fear of breaking the phone while sitting, and the other is that the phone tends to get a lot of lint on it from the pocket.This is often the only thing I need to reach for in the bag, so it is still super convenient.Other than the utility of holding other things for you, the case does a good job of protecting the Galaxy S4 phone.In addition, the Direct Channel Audio design that routes sound from the backside of the phone to the lower front is perfect if you choose to carry on a conversation using the speakerphone. Because the GS4 uses the microphone on the top of the phone instead of the bottom one (it has two microphones) during speakerphone mode, you should hold the phone "upside down" for the best sound clarity and antenna performance.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DR8KSA4" id="B00DR8KSA4-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-21:</strong> I really thought I would love this wallet case.

This cover has "fake" buttons molded over the real ones. I guess it would help keep them clean (or dry), but they are not as sensitive as the real things, which other cases allow access to through cutouts. Not sure why this cover opted for covered buttons. The added thickness is apparent but not obtrusive. I kinda like the idea of having a place to hold cards and cash, but I am not one who would use that feature regularly (I don't carry a wallet because it doesn't make sense to me to put all your most valuable stuff in one an easy to loose package). However, there are times, like at the beach, where I can see this feature being handy. Or, you could just use the pocket for business cards or none essential stuff. Overall, a nice case with a card/cash feature some may find useful.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DR8KSA4" id="B00DR8KSA4-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-27:</strong> This Galaxy S4 case is made of a flexible rubber like material, except the wallet section, on the back, is a leather like material.  The phone snaps firmly into the case.  The case covers the power and volume buttons, but these buttons can still be operated by pushing on the corresponding buttons built into the sides of the case.  All ports in the phone are directly accessible through openings in the case and the built-in "audio amplifier" diverts audio from the rear speaker to the front of the case, with no apparent reduction in volume.  The case adds very little bulk to the phone and would probably offer some protection if the phone is dropped.The wallet section holds up to three cards and a few paper bills, but this many items make for a tight fit and I would not recommend trying to squeeze anything else into the small sleeve.  The FAQ card included in the packaging also does not recommend putting more than three cards in the wallet.Since the case does not cover the screen, a screen protector is almost a necessity, but unfortunately no screen protector is provided with this product.  The manufacturer does include a small gray screen cleaning cloth, but this is not in any way a substitute for a screen protector. On the plus side, the edge of the case is raised slightly above the glass screen, so that, when the phone is placed face down on a flat surface, the screen does not touch the surface.The bottom line is that this case is ingenuously designed and might eliminate the need to carry a full sized wallet.  It would be great for those occasions when you just need a phone, an ID and one or two other cards.  If your lifestyle lends itself for these types of outings, I enthusiastically recommend this case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DR8KSA4" id="B00DR8KSA4-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-17:</strong> Fits like a glove and is beautiful to look at.

A way to carry some cash, your ID, and a credit card or two without needing a wallet. I can definitely see the use as an &#34;extra case&#34; that you use for a night on the town or for when you really cannot afford the space for a wallet.But for day-to-day use, the wallet capacity is just too small. It really feels stuffed at 2 credit cards, a few bills, and my ID. Also, at work I often leave my phone sitting on my desk. I never worried about anyone taking my phone. But a bill would be easy to sneak I wouldn't notice until I needed it.Also, don't try to put change in there. It just doesn't work for that.As for phone protection: I would say it is ok. It completely covers the back and sides of the S4 (which is available in colors....so, people might want to be able to see them?) so it protects from scratches and minor drops.The sound director is a little odd. I've had several people ask me &#34;why does your case have a bump?&#34; When I explain what it is, they think that it is weird a phone would need that, and I have to agree.Buttons: The buttons are not as responsive as I would like. I find myself having to hit them a couple of times to make the phone do what I want it to. At other times, I can mash the button all day long and nothing happens because I am too close to the edge.Overall: 3 stars. A good idea, but I think that this product is not good for &#34;all the time&#34; usage as a wallet, and is not up to the standards of usability (ie buttons) of other, similarly priced cases.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DR8KSA4" id="B00DR8KSA4-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-26:</strong> The wallet feature of this case is useful only to those people that don't carry more than three cards.  I carried my driver's license, ATM, and one credit card and that was the capacity of this wallet.  As for bills, the best option is to put it in between two cards.  As such, this really cannot hold a lot of money (unless you carry around $50s or $100s).  Having the cards at the back is not really too annoying and the case itself is actually pretty good.Unfortunately, I have too many other cards that I carry around that I need a wallet anyway.

No where in the packaging I received does it claim to be leather so why the $40.00 price tag?

To reiterate, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the CM4 Q Card Case and it fits the S4 perfectly but it does not offer cut outs for the buttons which is a deal breaker for me.

A wallet, with space for the cellphone, that's what I THOUGHT this was going to be and what I thought would be useful to me. I have a wallet and I have a protective case for the cellphone for stowing it when I'm not using it, and I THOUGHT this would combine those two things into one.Instead it's just a little plastic tray to snap the phone into? When I first opened the package I almost threw it away as part of the packaging!It only covers the back and sides of the phone (if you have the right one that fits), it does NOT cover the front, does NOT protect it at all when it's in my pocket, which is where I NEED something to protect and cover the WHOLE phone....So would I really want my cellphone to have credit cards and money attached to it all the time I have it out and am using it?

Wish it had a wrist band but its definitely something id recommend for people on the go.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DR8KSA4" id="B00DR8KSA4-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-02:</strong> If you want to carry a card and cash, this is a great all in one case.

After having used so many different cases (primarily Otterboxes and Lifeproof) I'm a tough sell when it comes to cases.  I look for a good fit and finish and like to see how they hold up over time.  Conceptually, the case is very nice and the thought of carrying credit cards and a little cash is nice.  I am very brand loyal so I would most likely go for theSpeck Products SmartFlex Card Samsung Galaxy S4 Case - Retail Packaging - Blackwhich I think is the direct competitor for this case.The main reasons for the 2-star review is my initial impression of the fabric portion of the case and the price point.  I am not very impressed with the construction and choice of materials and would be concerned about losing my credit cards and cash out of this pocket (the Speck case seems a little more solid with the rigid construction).  I would hate to lose my cards and the flexibility of this part does not instill a lot of confidence in me.  The pocket could be reinforced with a snap or something.  After some use, I found that with some use, my credit cards were falling out.For the money, really not impressed with the materials used and the way it holds credit cards (with no snap or closure mechanism).Please also note that this case does not fit the Samsung S4 Active.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DR8KSA4" id="B00DR8KSA4-review21" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-11:</strong> Finally found a case for my precious Samsung Galaxy S4.  Here is a brief description of each feature of this case:Protection: It protects your phone's back fully.  The front protection relies on "bumpers" where if your phone falls on the ground, the bumpers will hit the ground first, holding the precious screen back.  The only way it won't protect your screen is if your screen lands on an object that sticks out(ex: some jagged edge or a pole.)Back Wallet: Perfect for those who are on a pocket diet.  You can easily fit an ID, a credit card a money bill in the back, which is perfect if you want to go to the beach and don't want to drag the wallet with you.Sound Channel: It creates a sound channel that will be redirected to 90 degrees of your phone, as oppose to 180 degrees while the phone is lying on it's back without the case.Buttons Cover: The buttons become more sensitive and easier to press as a result.  Sometimes, it even made the buttons a little to sensitive.This case currently comes in four colors to choose from.  Customer service is great and the contact information is listed on a card inside the package should you ever need help with the case.  This is no doubt one of the best and innovative cases you can currently buy for your SG4.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DR8KSA4" id="B00DR8KSA4-review22" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-18:</strong> ...and she loves it.My wife has a Galaxy 4 and she loves this cover.

High quality, much like the Samsung Galaxy S4 itself, but it adds some very useful features. The wallet is the obvious one, and it is very handy to hold a credit card, ID and a few bills. One of my favorite features is the passive speaker amplifier built into the case. This helps make the speaker louder and directs the audio towards you when listening to music. It's a great feature that is the icing on the cake for this case. Of course, I didn't even mention the protection it gives in case you drop your phone. This is probably the nicest S4 case I have used or seen and I highly recommend it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DR8KSA4" id="B00DR8KSA4-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-03:</strong> The Q card case helps you to keep your phone, ID and credit card in one place so that you can minimize bulk at times when it is necessary. My evaluation as follows:Pros:1.  Good snug fit on the phone with no lift on my screen protector2.  Back pouch is well constructed so that even though it stretches a bit when you put your card in, it does not remain loose so that your card will fall out.3.  Opening on the underside of push so you can easily push your card out rather than over stretching it4.  Maintains ok traction - in between a glossy plastic case and silicone5.  Doesn't add much more bulk to your case.Cons:1. Sound amplifier is just a bubbling out of the case.  It ends up trapping lint, dirt more than anything else.  THey should have just left that part open.2.  When you put more than 1 card in the pouch, it becomes a bit harder to take out, it is so tight.  So you always have to take both out and put one back in.3.  The pouch is so tight you, really cant put more than 2 cards in without struggling.  If you are putting one card in, you can't get in more than a couple of bills. It is more for emergency cash than anything else.In general, this case is great for those times when you know all you are going to need is your ID and  a credit card. It is good for those instances at airports, clubs, and/or amusement parks.  But you will probably have to carry your cash with you.  My initial concern is that over time, the pouch stretches out so much that it becomes loose and then your cards can slip out without you knowing.  So far this has not happened  b/c it is so tight.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DR8KSA4" id="B00DR8KSA4-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-16:</strong> Can your case do this?Amplify your audio?Put 3 credit cards in it?Let you toss your wallet?This $40 case can.

You will have to decide for you whether this product will suit your needs. Over the past month, both my husband and I have tried out this wallet case on our Galaxy S4 phones. I used it very little, since, as a mother of three, I already have my huge "mom purse" that comes everywhere with me. I have little use for a cell phone wallet case.My husband got a lot more use out of this wallet case, and enjoyed many features, though he ultimately switched back to his old protective case. This wallet case does what it advertises: it holds a few credit cards and maybe a *little* cash with the cards, though it was a stretch at first. The wallet doesn't stretch too much with use, but then, you wouldn't want it to get loose would you? No.For a "wallet case", it's very compact, though it will chunk up your phone a bit. That comes with the territory I suppose. I really like the color options, and the quality of this case seemed very good. I definitely trust it as a protective cover for the phone. The sound amplifying feature is a nice touch!So why the 3 stars? There were two aspects that we didn't really like: the buttons are harder to push. I wish this wallet case was designed with cut out spaces for the buttons, because the plastic covering the button made our phones much less responsive. Second, the price on this case is pretty high. They do deliver a quality product, it does what it says, yes. However, there are comparable products out there at a fraction of the cost.So, ultimately, you're going to have to decide for yourself: is this case right for me and my needs? If you can't slim down to a couple credit cards and little cash, then it's probably not. If you need a temporary solution to reduce what you carry with you for whatever reason, then this might be a good product for you. If you need a long-term solution for the same reason, I might warn that the forceful button pushing gets a bit tiresome.I admire this company's design and ambition with their wallet cases, I think the price is on the higher side, and I think this product might be perfect for *some*, but not all.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DR8KSA4" id="B00DR8KSA4-review28" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-27:</strong> I got this case for my Samsung Galaxy S4 because I thought it would be nice to have an option to have credit cards and cash with me at times when I want to minimize the amount of things that I am carrying, like on a bike ride or a trip to the gym.  I will discuss how well this case fulfilled that need.The case is constructed of manly soft rubberized plastic that surrounds the side of the phone and wraps around to the back. I haven't had the bad luck to drop the phone while it has been in this case, but it seems like it would absorb a moderate amount of impact and prevent nicks and scratches to the entire sides, corners and back of the phone. It does make the phone quite a bit thicker and bigger feeling because of all of the rubber and of course the leather card slot on the back, and it gets even thicker when you actually put cards in.The volume buttons and power button on the side are covered with raised bumps that give you a good tactile indication when you are feeling for the buttons. However, I had some minor problems with how the case fit around the power button. I think that it may be keeping the power button partially pressed or not letting the button release properly because many times when I give the power button a quick press to turn it on, it will instead read as a hold down and pop up the shutdown options. I haven't found any problems with the volume buttons on the left side however.The rubber sides of the case wrap around to the front of the screen and provide a raised ridge so that when you place the phone face down, the glass screen does not contact the surface.  However, I had a problem with the wrap around portion happening to just bump up against the edge of my Zagg stick-on screen protector so that now the screen protector is coming off on the top right corner and along the right side.  I have two other cases, a Spigen slim and an Otterbox Commuter.  Both of those other cases also wraparound to the front of the screen and have ridge there, but neither them caused problems with the screen protector. This is not necessarily a problem with the case, but by coincidence, the end of the case edge just happened to be positioned right at the edge of the screen protector.The case also has an &#34;audio amplifier&#34; feature which consists a hollow tube in the molding that channels the sound from the rear facing speaker to an opening at the bottom right of the front of the phone. I was surprised at how well this worked. When watching videos, The dialogue is much more intelligible due to this audio channel directing the sound forward instead of backwards.Now for the main purpose for why this case exists, the card slots on the back of the case. While the majority of the case is made out of the rubberized plastic, the large flat section of the back panel is covered with leather-like material with a slot for credit cards. You can fit about A maximum of three credit cards in the slot, But that is an extremely tight fit. It's possible that, like wallets do, this level stretch out as time goes by, but I haven't had it long enough to do that yet. The size of the spot is exactly that of a credit card, so you can keep a couple of credit cards and a photo ID. There is a small cut out on the opposite side of the card slot so that you can use a finger to help push card out. This cutout is very handy because otherwise the cards will be very hard to pull out, especially when the case is new and the leather is very tight.  However, I that it was harder to put paper money in the slot, because of the sizing. A US dollar bill sticks out kind of awkwardly if it is folded in half and put into the card slot, and if you fold it into thirds, it's easy to get the bill lost inside the slot and it can't be pushed out using the cut-out because it is so flexible.  It is best if you can put any paper money in between two cards that are inside of the slot so that you can always get it out by pulling out or pushing out the cards.  I still don't know if I would want to make this the full-time case for my phone, because the credit cards are visible and I don't know if I want to make my phone even more of a theft target.  I still need to carry my wallet most of the time due to all of the other things I need to carry, so why shouldn't I have a slim phone the majority of the time.  But if you are card and cash minimalist, this case would work out well for you.Overall, I am pleased with the construction quality and features of this case.  I wish that it didn't push up my expensive screen protector and power button glitch is kind of annoying, but it's nice to be able to only carry one thing when needed.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DR8KSA4" id="B00DR8KSA4-review29" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-15:</strong> Nice, Light, Convenient and it is the only wallet case that really makes sense where the card holder is outside instead of in between.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DR8KSA4" id="B00DR8KSA4-review30" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-18:</strong> This fit my S4 like a glove and protected my phone better than other options. This covers all the corners, which very few other ones do, even though that is most likely where the phone will land if it is dropped. I was most intrigued by the wallet aspect, so I picked it up wanting to give it a try. Also, I love the feel of leather, so I really enjoyed that aspect of this case.Well, see that wallet in the picture? Good luck getting that much stuff in there! I barely got a credit card and my driver's licence in there and then it nearly took the jaws of life to pull them out. I guess this will be helpful in those occasions when I only need to cards with me, which actually does happen quite often, but most of the time this isn't an option. If I could get three cards plus some cash in there, that would be great, but I never could do that.I keep it around and put it around my phone now and then, but for the most part it just sits around. I had a friend who wanted to borrow it, and I thought he had an S4, but he had an S3. The case itself did fit, but then all the buttons were in the wrong place. So if you are wondering if this is S3 compatible, the answer is: not really.I can see some people loving something like this, it just wasn't for me 95% of the time. It has its good points, but the wallet could have been better constructed.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DR8KSA4" id="B00DR8KSA4-review31" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-06:</strong> I got the Pacific Green CM4 Q Card Case for my girlfriend's Galaxy S4, and she loves it.  It's usually harder to find nicer cases for specific Android phones, so it's great that CM4 offers this for the S4 and in different colors too.  The Pacific Green color matches well Amazon's product photos and looks great in person too.The CM4 Q Card Case replaced replaced a basic, thin, silicone one and didn't add much bulk over the old case.  Most of the Q Card Case is made of a hard and slightly flexible plastic that wraps around the back and sides of the phone.  There are holes to keep the USB connector, headphone jack, and IR blaster accessible, but the side buttons are covered up.  The holes are wide enough to accommodate larger USB and headphone connectors.  Over the buttons are raised, flexible covers that you press to reach the buttons on the phone.  My girlfriend mentioned that the sleep button felt a lot more sensitive with the case attached, but she got used to it pretty quickly.  The bottom of the case has a cupped cover over the speaker that helps direct and amplify sounds from your speaker.  It works really, really well.The cardholder is a really convenient feature and feels very sturdy.  It's made of a leather-like material with some stitching along the edges.  My girlfriend likes how it looks, and uses the cardholder all the time to store notes to herself.  It's also convenient for when she wants to go out with just her phone, a few essential cards, and no purse.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DR8KSA4" id="B00DR8KSA4-review32" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-29:</strong> I have an addiction to cell phone cases it seems. I've tried dozens of them in the quest for the perfect companion. Sounds cheesy I know, but think about how much you have your phone with you... Does it not make sense to want to find the best case?I used an otterbox defender for a few months and liked it, but I had two issues, first off it was really bulky but it protected the phone good. The second was it hung on a belt clip and I had an issue where the belt clip snapped as I walked around a corner and it got snagged on the door frame, busted the plastic molding on the case and the phone fell out. Now otterbox is sending me a new one free of charge but it still will have the same issue, a big case that you can't really put in your pocket.So next I looked for functional and tried the amazon basic cases, just the rubber case, tried an Sview and that didn't work well at all. Then I saw this one and I had to get it. I use my phone a lot at work to listen to podcasts and talk radio and one issue I have is the sound comes out the back. The guys who made this case put a sound deflector on it to channel the sound out the front. It works surprisingly well and I love it because of that.The other feature is it has a wallet built into the back. For me I could fit 3 cards in and that was it. Not enough for me to ditch my wallet and carry this only, but it allows me to throw my company "grid card" in so when I need it I have quick access to it and a few dollars for the vending machines.The one other great thing about this case is the weight, it weighs almost nothing yet the protection is great. There is a thin lip around the front so the glass of the screen never touches the surface, the case itself feels really good and the buttons are covered but actually feel better to press in this case then without, and a lot better then the otterbox defender.All in all this is my new favorite case for the GS4.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DR8KSA4" id="B00DR8KSA4-review33" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-17:</strong> I typically carry a front pocket wallet and my S4, but sometimes it's just inconvenient, like when I'm going to the dojo or at work.

It protects the phone's edges from damage in the inevitable drops and jostles. It has a small &#34;cup&#34; in the microphone area which reduces wind sounds in outdoor situations. It has a clever credit-card (or, I suppose, cash, drivers license, etc.) holder on the back, which securely holds the card in place, but has two notches to help you remove it when you need to.

I buy a slim phone because I want it to be slim.However, I also hate carrying my wallet with my DL and 6 or 7 credit cards, it is definitely a lot thicker than I would like. So on occasions when I go out for the night and I know I don't need all my cards with me, I switch over to a smaller wallet that only holds a couple cards. I've got a couple small wallets that I use for that purpose and none of them are particularly great.When I saw this phone case though, I had to give it a try. And it works great! It makes my phone a bit thicker but I don't have to carry a wallet at all! I've been very pleased with it, the construction is solid and it feels like it will last a good long time. It is pretty easy to insert and remove cards and some cash. The &#34;feel&#34; of the buttons goes away, you don't really get any feedback when you push them through the case's buttons, but they do in fact work fine. I'd say that is the only negative and it is relatively minor.I've got a black and a brown version. I thought I would prefer the brown, but find myself leaning towards the black. With the brown, the &#34;leather&#34; looks nice, but the brown plastic looks very &#34;plasticy&#34; and I guess that makes sense. With the black version, the black plastic blends in with the black leather and it just looks more high end.Overall, if you are happy only being able to carry a couple cards with you, then this definitely works very well and looks great.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DR8KSA4" id="B00DR8KSA4-review39" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-19:</strong> The concept of having a cellphone case that can hold a few of your credit cards so you can ditch your wallet is a good one.  For my personal style though, I only use this wallet case a few days per month for my Samsung Galaxy S4.This case does add a bit of extra thickness to my phone beyond my normal slim case.  This makes it just a bit too thick to be as comfortable for me in my front pants pocket.  So on normal days I still use my slim case in one front pocket and my slim wallet in my other front pocket (plus I can hold more stuff in my wallet).  I will use the wallet case if I'm going out on weekends and just want to keep track of one thing.Overall build quality on this case is good.  Thus far it has been a very tight fit for me to put on my phone (not super easy like my slim plastic case) - but this may stretch out more over time.  At $40 a bit pricey for my personal usage - overall I rate 4-stars in consideration of price/value.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DR8KSA4" id="B00DR8KSA4-review40" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-30:</strong> The Samsung Galaxy S4 Wallet case is quite nice.  I had a hard shell on my Galaxy 4 and when this arrived, I knew that I would be using the nice soft textured smart case for sure instead of the hard shell.  The case fits very nicely over the phone.  The extended buttons actually make it easier to use the phone buttons!  This is most excellent, as the phone definitely can be a little tricky to feel the controls.  This case resolves that issue.  It doesn't replace your wallet, but can hold two credit cards comfortably and a 20 dollar bill underneath.  So if you are in a rush or don't want to carry your wallet, this is a nice way to go. However, it does not hold three credit cards even remotely comfortably as it says it does.  Too snug, the cards would be almost impossible to get out on a regular basis. But I put in my license, debit card and a twenty and it works fine and I can go anywhere without my bulky wallet.  Overall, a nice looking case that has a few extras, the extended buttons are great, the holder works for a couple of cards, and the sound comes out very nicely.

I can't say I'll use it as my every day case, as I prefer something with a nice graphic and a smoother feel than when you have goodies jammed into a pocket on the back. But for quickie jaunts like I've mentioned above it's good. And it's easy enough to pop on and off so you can have a different &#34;regular&#34; daily case and only use it when needed.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DR8KSA4" id="B00DR8KSA4-review43" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-19:</strong> The wallet case is great.  It does everything advertised without too much extra bulk.  The case itself has a high quality stitched leather look, and has held up well to frequent use.  It also has a raised &#34;bezel&#34; that ensures that the screen is untouched when you lay it down on flat surfaces.  All of the ports have plenty of clearance, and the button overlays are just what you'd expect.  The little acoustic amplifier at the bottom of the phone works surprisingly well, and the wallet component securely keeps three cards comfortably.The only downside is that everyone can see your top card if you lay your phone face down on a table.  Might make your phone an even more attractive target for thieves.  On the other hand, you're less likely to forget your wallet if you don't have to carry it anywhere.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DR8KSA4" id="B00DR8KSA4-review44" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-17:</strong> I've got a black one and it's perfect for the business environment, but if you want a fancy one, there are several color to choose from.

I generally use an Otterbox Defender. While I think the Otterbox is far superior for protecting the phone I have used cases like this the mostly protect the back of the phone while  leaving the screen open. The cost of more protection is the bulk it adds to the size of the phone. I didn't think this case made the phone too large but then again its probably enough protection for  most people, and lets face it any case offers more protection than not using a case.At first I thought this would turn my phone into something like a front pocket wallet and I could just put the essentials in it when I went out (license, atm card, credit card, cash). And yes you can get the 3 cards and cash they advertise into it. So while it does what they say I am going to say that in my use it doesn't do it well enough to be used like I wanted. It does hold cards but if you use 3 cards don't expect to get a lot of cash in there. With 3 cards I had to force money in, and Id guess that you could get about 4 bills in there once you fold them enough to fit and because of that I used bigger bills ($20s, 50s). Problem with larger bills is that a lot of times when you use one large bill you get back many bills as change. So money ends up in pocket unless you feel like jamming it in the case. Then if it is very full you sort of lose the ability to remove any of the cards or cash very well. The less cards that go in make room for more cash obviously Maybe I'm old-fashioned but I tend to want to pay for things with cash when I go out so a more cash friendly item would be a better option for me. If you just wanted to carry cards and you didn't need to have instant access to them this would probably work well. Personally I will either go to a front pocket wallet or just use the regular wallet as they are more cash friendly.It does a good  job routing the phone sound to the front of the phone. Actually  is does everything they say it will do so I cant really rate it too low but its not very useful to me so it had to lose a couple stars. The good thing is that most people including myself take their phones everywhere so you wouldn't need to worry about losing things. And if they make this with a money clip attached it would of been a 5 star from me but then some other people would of rated it lower because its &#34;bulky&#34;.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DR8KSA4" id="B00DR8KSA4-review46" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-24:</strong> The Samsung Galaxy S4 Wallet Case is awesome!

It's chic, simply put. Very light weight, fits my phone flawlessly and does indeed boost the sound when I stream Pandora. Buttons are easy to use; I never need to struggle to turn it on or adjust the volume. Where the camera lens is located,there is plenty of clearance so there's no shadows to the shots. Also a nice touch: a very tiny Micro-fiber cloth to keep the screen clean. NICE!!!I must say: I was the tiniest bit perplexed by a small webbed strap that came with the case; I had to look at all the photos to see if it was supposed to be used, but I guess it's not.I've read where other reviewers have chosen to use the open slot to store cash/cards, but I don't trust Fate that much! Plus, I never place my phone in a pocket...ever!, so I don't require something that will slip into a pocket. Therefore, since my Galaxy is for work, I use the slot for business cards, which is all I require of it. I'm too old to do the Bar Scene, so there's no need for me to have the skimpiest "wallet-like" purse to stow essentials away.For the person who rarely, if ever, has cash on hand and uses plastic 99% of the time, this product delivers everything with style. I, however, use cash 99% of the time so the lack of having a change purse or ability to handle more than a single bill or two, limits my use of it. Now, I know the war between Apple vs. Android and this product is designed for Android, but if Belkin could see fit to make this product for Android, I'd be ALL over it!Belkin Floral Wallet and Case Wristlet for iPhone 5 and 5S (Black)I actually own this for my iPhone and much prefer it for the minimalist touch. It has a very handy strap when you have NO pockets; it secures with a snap so there is zero danger of cards falling out, and there is a dedicated spot for multiple bills...I've actually had $100 bucks in bills in that slot with no loss of ability to close or use it. The down side is that you look goofy as heck if you need to make a call while your phone is in the case. THAT is the Plus side of the Samsung case; it's not much larger than your phone so making calls looks normal.It boils down to how LITTLE do you want to carry with your phone when you go out on occasions where "Less Is More"?</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DR8KSA4" id="B00DR8KSA4-review54" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-14:</strong> The case is of seemingly good sturdy quality. It is a perfect fit for the Galaxy S4. I do like how it looks and feels. Some have complained that the case should not have buttons, but I completely disagree. I think it having the buttons makes it easier to push the buttons - other than as with some cases having to fit your finger past the case to engage them can become very difficult - especially if it is a thick case.The fit is nice and the fact that it can store a couple of cards and money can definitely come in handy. However, I have to address a couple of design issues. One is the amplified sound that should be a big selling point. It was a good try and definitely makes it louder - however louder is not always better. If the sound is turned up at all, it sounds tinnier than normal on the phone. Makes sense as the sound is just being bounced from the back speaker and redirected to the front of the case.  I could easily give it 4 stars on that as you have no option to use the amplified sound or not - it just is a part of the case. But, since you can always just turn the sound back down to fix the quality a bit, I won't. Also, I will add, I did find that you can download certain bass booster apps to help with that issue a bit. The other thing I would like to see is an added kickstand on the design. I am not faulting the makers for not having it mind you, but just suggesting it to improve the design. So basically just create a hole in the back of the case for the sound to escape naturally and add a kickstand and you will have a winner.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DR8KSA4" id="B00DR8KSA4-review55" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-29:</strong> The case for S4 is great accessory.

It's a much higher quality than I thought it would be, and seems to be well made.

Any more than that and it just becomes too tight. For me, though, I just can't get comfortable with keeping cash & cards on my phone (all my eggs in one basket, so to speak), so I use the wallet for keeping notes, receipts, etc. I also put a note in there with some contact info (in case I lose the phone and the battery dies before someone finds it).Even though I don't use this as intended, I still think it's a very good execution of a very good idea.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DR8KSA4" id="B00DR8KSA4-review59" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-02:</strong> This is my favorite case.

If you can cull out of your wallet 2-3 cards and a couple bills (cash) to live on, you can put them in this case, insert your S4 and just carry around one thing all day. Leave your bulging wallet behind! 2-3 cards would be your driver's license, Student ID and a credit/debit card.There is no getting around the reality that this does bulk up your phone. Any case will, but this does add a fair amount of thickness, though less than an extended battery pack would. Also, though the S3 and S4 have similar dimensions, buttons and ports have been moved so that this really only works for an S4 (time for an upgrade!).The real issue is... can people who are used to toting wallets, purses or bags with "everything" really discipline themselves to only needing a couple cards and some cash? This violates the old adage: Be prepared! I tend to carry my health insurance card, auto insurance, company and personal credit cards, etc. That won't all fit in here. And the other things I tote around (back up battery, Kindle reader) mean that I usually need a small bag. So while this does let me leave all that behind, I don't tend to do so.However! For a night on the town, this is perfect. And if I was younger and had less "baggage", I probably really could roll with just my phone and the items in this case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DR8KSA4" id="B00DR8KSA4-review61" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-21:</strong> This is a rugged little case.

I bought my S4 months ago, but hadn't bothered putting a case on it because there was no case on the market that I particularly liked.  And really, there was no urgency: the screen is gorilla glass, and my phone spends its life in my purse or in my hands, for the most part.The case the phone comes with is a flimsy white plastic.  It's awful quality, I can't imagine why Samsung charges $600 for a phone and then ships it with such a crappy case.  Of course Samsung probably expects you to upgrade your case as soon as you purchase your phone, and to that end the entire back of the phone comes off and is replaced by a new case.The S4 Samsung branded flip cover (with and without window)Samsung Galaxy S4 Flip Cover Folio Case (Black)is pretty flimsy as well.  Plus the flip cover isn't particularly good at protecting the phone, so really, why bother.A number of the other options on the market seemed really bulky to me:  OtterboxOtterBox 77-27604 Commuter Series Case for Samsung Galaxy S4 - 1 Pack - Carrier Packaging - BlackSpigenSPIGEN SGP Samsung Galaxy S4 Case Slim [Ultra Fit] [Smooth Black] Premium SM Coated Matte Hard Case for Galaxy S IV Galaxy SIV i9500 - ECO-Friendly PackagingWhen I ordered this case, I wasn't sure if it would be any good; a lot depends on how the product feels in your hands, and how the quality holds up over time.My opinion: this is the best available case for the Samsung Galaxy S4.  It provides enough protection to the phone without adding so many security measure that the product becomes a bulky brick in your hands (like Otterbox); it has a sleek design so it feels nice in my hands (the phone is big enough already, if I wanted to carry around a mini tablet, I would have purchased the Note 2, not the S4); and the plastic is sturdy, of good quality, and not slippery.  The small leather wallet part of the case is in the back of the phone, and is well made and sturdy.  I do not expect it to fall apart, or become so loose that my card and ID fall out (of course it is leather, so it will loosen up over time, so don't over stuff it).  Also: the audio amplification really works!  The sound on the S4 is fantastic already, this just turns up the volume and keeps it clear. It's great that the case designers thought of this, because otherwise phone cases can mess up the audio of the phone.As far as color:  the red is a very bright shade, I would call it "American Flag Red", to give you a good idea of its shade and vibrancy; the black is matte and professional looking.I would highly recommend this product; if your S4 doesn't have a case, definitely purchase this one, you absolutely won't regret it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DR8KSA4" id="B00DR8KSA4-review63" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-19:</strong> This is a fantastic case.

I've only had it for about a month and the case is already turning this nasty white color that won't wash off.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008QBGIDI" id="B008QBGIDI-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-17:</strong> I have been using this cover for several months now.

This did the trick, and did it cheaply. The cost of this 25-foot cable is much more reasonable than cables of shorter length. I am very pleased with this. Sound quality was not a major consideration since it only has to play through the speakers of phones. Still, all things considered, I recommend this.

I would recommend this for the price and the length just to get by but beware it is the one of the cheapest feeling wires you will ever see.  I thought it was twelve feet for how small it rolls up till I re read twenty five feet and I said wow.  I recommend if having any high end stuff to spend another five bucks and buy a lifetime wire instead of this one.  One benefit of this wire is it rolls up to a tiny hoop and would fit easily in a velcro case with your portable cd player.  Good for just getting by.Update: they sit in a closet so nothing new, but I did think to ad that they are great for portability being so thin and I'm sure they work fine, just didn't clear out the hum between my comp and my tv same as one I had built in my vga cable.  So anyway, ez to through in a bookbag or nap sack and have that cable with you it takes up no room.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000V6R2OK" id="B000V6R2OK-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-07:</strong> i wanted too hook up my very nice headphones to the tv so i don't disturb the baby or the wife and have enought wire to ready the couch or comfy chairs an this works great</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000V6R2OK" id="B000V6R2OK-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-23:</strong> These are the best cables for that quick audio connection in newer autos.

All I got was distorted mono sound or stereo sound with a 60 cycle hum depending on how far in I pushed the plug. Pushing it all the way in only produced hum. Tried it on a number of devices. Same results. My guess is that the internal wires are not connected at the right spots in the plugs. I bought a shorter, more expensive cable that works.

I compared the two when she mentioned she got the pack for about the same price as I bought the single amPen.  The lanyard/body is exactly the same  (except for the iDream logo), and they both feature removable, replaceable tips (although I can't seem to get the tip off the amPen at all... hrmm).  The iDream tip came off with a little effort.The tips themselves, however, differ greatly. The iDream tips are significantly longer and "grabbier". I can hear distinct squeaking of the iDream's tip across my tablet's screen and feel a almost reluctant, skipping resistance while scrolling,  whereas the amPen has a shallower tip yet smoother (and noiseless) resistance.In the overall scheme of things, yes, the amPen Hybrid Stylus has a superior tip with every other aspect of the two being the same.... except I paid pretty much the same for one amPen as these 6 iDream. Regardless,  I would still personally repurchase amPen's hybrid tip as the squeaking from this one got annoying very quickly.  :p</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00B16ZNEU', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00B16ZNEU', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B0053XYCGM</h2>    <p class="price"> $B0053XYCGM</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

So I had to get a case with screen protectors ASAP.I didn't realize the made really good cases with a screen protector already installed.  I've always been a fan of OtterBox but didn't know they made such a good case.  The Defender Series for OtterBox is the best so far!I got a Black and White case because I've always gotten Black cases and thought I would try something new.  I saw a couple of bad reviews on here about it because of the pre-installed screen protector.  But in my opinion, the pre-installed screen protector is better than the ones you have to put on yourself.FYI, the pre-installed screen protector makes a minor ring on the top of the screen, but is not noticeable when phone is on.I rate it a 5 out of 5 star (so far) because of the quality, design and the pre-installed screen protector.If you go to At&t;, the Defender series for OtterBox is $49.99.I got mine on here for about $13.00 and I paid for 1-3 day shipping and it was still less than half the price for one at At&t.;I definitely recommend it to people who need great quality protection for their iPhone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B0053XYCGM', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B0053XYCGM', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00337KT1W</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00337KT1W</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

Adds a little stand to the back of the phone,.........sweet.Like I've stated, I really hope the battery starts to hold a charge, I really need this thing.UPDATE: Download a widget called "Battery Left" (Thanks to Clay Kelley) and recalibrate the battery by draining and recharging the battery a few times. This should allow the Droid's firmware to recognize the higher capacity battery installed.

Basically I know how long this battery works on my phone first - it'll be 1.5 to 2.5 days if I don't leave the screen running alot.  Now I simply ignore the battery meter when it drops to 5% RED on the first day because that is the lowest it can go (even though we know the battery has 50%+ charge left in it).  The phone will operate fine at 5% battery with the blinking red dot.  As time draws near for a charge based on knowing when it's really close to about 20% from all the experimenting when I used to power it off/on to get a reading on the battery, then I put the phone on its original motorola charger overnight.  I always use the charger that came with the phone because it shakes hands with the phone and delivers more current than USB is specified for giving a rapid charge to full.  The fact that it's taken way more than 1300 mAH from the battery and is at 5% will keep the charger going strong all night.  The next morning it is at MAX without ever messing with the power button - just knowing about how long its been is sufficient to get the extra life and anytime you need to know for sure how much is left, power it off and back on for a semi-accurate read on the remaining power.The only time I cycle the power to find out what the real battery level is is if I am doing something critical or running a new app.This battery should not be drained dead-dead because it will be hard to charge (i.e. you need to power off the phone's radio with airplane mode and tap the top button to dim the display) - knowing when it is dead dead is hard too because motorola's "bean counter" approach to telling you how much life you have left is a bad way to deal with oversize cells.Should you find that you REALLY got your hicap battery down to a REAL 5% (by turning the phone off and back on while plugged in and getting a 5% or less battery capacity) you will need to modify the normal plug it in charge proceedure so that enough power is available to recharge the cell.  Turn off the radio by using airplane mode.  Force dim the display all the way down and turn it off once you finish.  Kill any apps running that are battery hoggs (life360 for example).  Use the genuine motorola cord and charger (not a PC or mac usb port) because they are designed to provide more power to the droid for charging than a normal usb port is required to provide.  Now let it charge OVERNIGHT and a little bit more if you can afford the timeNext morning it will obviously read max on the bat, but all night long there was a trickle charge going into the battery which brought it back to 2600 mAh give or take.  Leaving it connected will continue to add charge.  All li-ion batts benefit from sitting on the charger beyond their "full" voltage simply because that little bit of trickle current does keep putting a little more charge into the cell.  I have a 13,000 mah, 14.8V cell and a specially designed charger for it.  From near empty it takes 3 days to charge where the charger goes "green" from "red".I don't use the last "real" 20% off this cell and I can use the normal motorola charging proceedures. The problem stems from the fact that the battery can be 20% or 80% full and read 20% on droid's meter in both cases (and one more in between).  I have used it for 3 days down to 5%, which now I would only do in an emergency.  If I'm on my last discharge where it reads accurately I'll be looking for an outlet at 50% and have it on charge by 20%.This sounds complicated but after a while it is simple and you can just charge it every night.  Battery life is one of droid's shortcommings - this product gets you a full day and then some extra.  At least droid users *can* pop in a fresh cell when needed!(below was my first impression of this battery having read how to use it and the shortcommings)Droid does.  Yes indeed.  Charging batteries is done by leaving the charging voltage on the battery for as long as possible (as long as plugged in) - so charging this cell is a no brainer.Droid calculates discharge.  Therein lies the problem.  Droid under "about this phone" --> "battery usage" keeps track of every mAh used and where it went.  This is nice to see what apps are really sucking the battery dry, but it's also how droid knows how much power is remaining, and it assumes 1300 mAh is the battery capacity.  But with this attached, 2600+ is the capacity.Example - last night I forgot to plug Droid in.  I had charged the Innocell fully yesterday.  This morning I was at 5 percent and had a red light.  I did what the other reviewer said.  Turn off droid and restart it (it thinks I swapped batteries, something Iphones can not do).  Turned back on and I had 80% left based on voltage, not tabulated accounting of power used.  Yes, overnight I used 95% of 1300 mAh, but I had > 1000 mAh onboard which showed up as 80% full.The next release of the o/s needs to have a field where you key in your mAh if they continue using the tabulation method of power management.  As the 1300 mah cells age they will only hold 1000 mah and that must be accounted for.  Also advancements in technology will produce thin 1500 mah cells which need to be entered into the droid.  For now, this saved today because my phone is still running 30 hours since I last charged it.  Anyone with a droid knows 30 hours is a long time on one battery!Cons: - the phone won't fit in the dock with this battery and cover attached.  Oh well.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00337KT1W" id="B00337KT1W-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-05-03:</strong> I have used this manufacturer's porducts in 3 or 4 different types of phones now - and they all worked great.

It got buggy this week and just quit.2 months is not a reasonable product lifespan.  My OEM battery I bought from Amazon is fine.  I recomend purchasing the OEM battery.  They cost less than 1/2 the price of the Innocell battery on Amazon.Origional ReviewI enjoy my Droid phone and with my usage, I go through batteries quickly. You can conserve power by turning off options you are not using (Bluetooth, 3G, Screen Brightness, GPS, Wi-Fi, Checking Email)  I got this extended life battery and a spare OEM battery at the same time.  The battery did have some of the initial issues that were described by other reviews but the battery eventually worked properly.The GoodIt is nice having one battery that outlasts the OEM battery.  It was very frustrating to have my phone die on me and not be in a position to charge it. I don't seem to get twice the life from this extended life battery, but close to it.The BadThe battery does not fit in my Motorola car dock, which I use all the time.  It also doesn't fit in my desktop charging dock which I also like to use.  The additional bulk is not noticeable in a jacket pocket.  It is noticeable in snug jeans front pockets.ConclusionI am happy with the purchase.  I choose my battery according to what my use will be.  If I'm going to be in my car I use the OEM battery.  If I am out and about all day, I use the extended battery.  It is nice to have options.  I still bring my OEM spare battery when I don't want to take the chance of having a dead phone.Unlike our I-Phone friends we have the ability to pop in a new battery. ;-)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00337KT1W', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00337KT1W', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B0044WJUDS</h2>    <p class="price"> $B0044WJUDS</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

This means you have to pay attention to what you are doing as well, because it has to go in at the right angle or it will bind.. Unfortunately this battle also comes into play when you remove it.Personally I would prefer just having it go in easily after a break in period, like many other leather pouches. This will NEVER break in due to it's design. It will always be snug going in and out, and I think it is annoying and time consuming and requires both hands most of the time. That being said, it does work and looks ok, and has not broken down in the month I've been using it. But my eyes are already peeled for a replacement that fits well, looks good, and does not require thought, effort, or skill to use, because I am usually driving or walking or working and don't feel I need to unlock a puzzle to get to my phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0044WJUDS" id="B0044WJUDS-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-27:</strong> This case quickly clips on and off your belt.

My overall experience was positive, but with one issue I have not considered before using it.I am attaching a collage of 4 photos under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review.1. The solar panel is more compact that I anticipated. When not in use it folded up nicely into book-sized dimensions. Photo#1 and Photo#3 show the panel next to a ruler. Folded it measured 6.6" x 9", unfolded 19" x 9".2. The two USB outlets are located in a pocket inside of the pouch. See photo#2. The connection is attached to the pocket and cannot be moved. The pocket has a rubber band to hold something, perhaps a phone while it is being charged. The pocket was too small to fit my tablet which is sized 7.7" by 5.5".3. The third photo shows my tablet being charged by the solar panel.I used the solar panel to charge my Samsung Galaxy 7.7 table and Sansa Clip MP3 player. Both devices recognized the charger without problems and got charged.Now we come to the issue I encountered. I did not want to leave my tablet or MP3 in the full sun while charging them as sun exposure is bad for electronics. However the design of the solar panel made it difficult to keep the panel in the sun while keeping the devices in the shade. If the USB connector was not attached to the pocket but but rather was on the end of a USB cable then adding my own USB cable for the device together the longer cord would have been enough to easily position electronics out of the sun. With the length of the standard USB cable (26") it was a challenge to find a position that worked.Given my goal to keep my electronics in the shade I tried several options(1) On a sunny day I put both the panel and tablet in bright spot but out of the direct light. The tablet starting with 5% charge (i.e. practically discharged) the tablet showed that it recognized being charged but after 12 hours in INDIRECT light it did not get charged enough to be turned on.(2) I found a time in a day where I could put the panel in direct sun and stretch the USB cord in such a way that the tablet was out of the sun. I was able to charge it from 80% to 100% in about 3 hours.(3) I repeated the same sun for the panel/shade for the device configuration for MP3 player. Sansa got charged, but behaved strangely. Normally when I charge it from AC I cannot play it while it is being charged, the screen shows the charging mode (image of a battery). With the solar panel charge the MP3 player continued to play. I saw that the screen was not in the charging mode. I use my MP3 to listen to audio books, so the next time I used I found myself several chapters ahead of where I last listened. It did get fully charged while it was playing. The next time I had to make sure to pause the player manually before recharging.So overall it charged both of my devices, but I wish the design had a USB port on a cord that allowed more flexibility to put the device you are charging out of the sun's harmful direct light.  I hope the manufacture reading this comments can improve the future versions of the product, in the mean time I have purchased USB extension to overcome this short coming.Ali Julia review</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006ZRYU9O" id="B006ZRYU9O-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-26:</strong> I am glad i got this unit over the Goal Zero which, I think, is more well known.

The idea was to have an off grid way of powering up two iPhones in a power outage.  I tested my iPhone 4 using this panel and was able to get an 11 percent charge in 15 minutes.  That equals a full charge in less than 2 1/2 hours.  This is better than I expected.  I was also able to charge an iPad 3 with this panel, but I have no rates of charge for this.  After all, the reason I got the panel was for our two iPhones so this what I measured.Since I don't like exposing the phones to the sun, I also picked up two 8400 mAh batteries.[Upgraded Version] Anker Astro2 Dual USB Output 8400mAh Backup External Battery Pack Charger with built-in Flashlight for Smart phones, Android phones, PSP, GoPro; iPhone 5, iPhone 4S, iPad mini; Samsung Galaxy S3, Galaxy Series Smartphones; HTC One X ...]  These can be charged by the panel outside, then I use the batteries to charge the phones inside when they need juicing up.  Each battery is good for 3 complete iPhone charges and I can rotate the charging of each as needed.  I also have a 4000 mAh solar batteryOpteka BP-SC4000 Ultra Thin Solar Powered High Capacity (4000mAh) Backup Battery and Charger for Cell Phones, iPhone, iPod, and Most USB Powered Devicesthat takes about 5 days to fully charge during the short days of the winter sun.  Using this panel to assist charging my solar battery, has reduced the charge time to one day of winter sun.I was surprised at how small the panels became, when folded up.  They have a total footprint which is slightly smaller than my iPad.  The panels are surpringly light, and making them easily transportable and easy to hang from from one of the sturdy looking, fabric hangers.  Another nice feature is a pouch on the back of the panel.  This fits one of my battery packs with room to spare.  This keeps the packs out of the direct sun, when charging.  Inside the pouch are two USB ports which can be cabled into whatever is being charged, while in the pouch.  Since the pouch has a closable flap secured by a Velcro fastener, your device has some protection from rain and dust.  On a really hot day, it would probably be a good idea to charge batteries or phones outside the pouch in the shade.  The black pouch could get pretty hot on a long, summer day, not exactly the best conditions for a cell phone.Things I like-quality of construction-rapid charging time-portability-2 USB ports for simultaneous charging of 2 devices-priceThings that need improving-access to USB ports is a little snug for big hands-the panels seem to scratch easily and could be more scratch resistantAll in all, an excellent panel for charging batteries and small electronics up to the size of an iPad 3.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006ZRYU9O" id="B006ZRYU9O-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-19:</strong> I've used this both outside at a campsite and on the dashboard of my truck.

It works great!I get a lot of sun here until about 2pm in the winter, this provides me with enough time to charge my iPhone 4, my wife's iPhone 5, her iPad 1 and my iPad mini.It does require direct sunlight to charge more than 1 device - at least an Apple device.I've ordered a USB chargeable 6000mAH portable battery to plug into it to capture the rays when all my devices are charged - maybe for use on a cloudy day.The product is built well, though the panels were slightly scratched up when I received it, but it doesn't appear to affect functionality.I haven't plugged any of our portable devices into the wall since getting this thing a week ago. However, here's the catch - I live in San Diego and I suspect we get more Sun than most places so it works perfect here.The build quality is solid and it folds down to about the size of an iPad with the thickness of about three iPads.If you are thinking this will save you money on energy costs - not going to happen. I did some research and your average power usage on an i-device is about $1.50 - $2.00 a year.

I have a number of other USB chargers, both solar and hand-cranked, which worked fine with my iPhone but did not deliver sufficient wattage to charge my iPad.  The Instapark 10 watt solar charger did deliver enough power to charge my iPad, as long as the panel was in full sun.The panel is very easy to use.  It comes attached to a fold-up nylon case.  There's a pocket on the nylon case, and inside the pocket are a couple of USB ports.  Just plug your regular USB charging cable into the ports and your device will start charging (assuming the panel is in the sun).The panel charged my iPhone even when it wasn't in full sun.  For the iPad, the panel needed to be in full sun.  More importantly, if clouds pass in front of the sun, the iPad gets confused and delivers the dreaded error message saying it can't charge from what it's attached to.  Sometimes my iPad started charging again when the clouds passed, but sometimes I had to disconnect and reconnect the iPad to resume charging.  This isn't a huge deal, but it does mean you can't just leave the iPad for a few hours and assume it will be charged when you return.  The solution is to put a battery pack between the charger and the iPad if you need plug-and-forget functionality.Given the relatively low price of this charger, and its ability to charge smartphones and tablets, it's a great device to have on hand if you live in an area with extended power outages.  For me, it's been a good investment.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006ZRYU9O" id="B006ZRYU9O-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-06:</strong> In summary this is a pretty decent and a pleasant surprise in a solar charger for electronic devices. It charges my Galaxy Note 2 (3,100 mAh battery) in 3 hours no matter where I am as long as the sun is out. Price is a bit high at $50, but it performs better than others.To test it out, I put the charger in direct sunlight, angled directly at the sun, and turned it periodically to keep it aligned. The Note 2 was idle with the screen off running Battery Monitor Widget from the app store. The rate was approx 30%/hour, meaning I was getting about 1.5 amps of charge. Factoring in the limited juice it was pulling while operating, that's decently close to 2 amps.There's no way you'll be able to have this device pay for itself in any close-to-reasonable amount of time though.My 2A 5V charger takes 2 hours to charge the battery. Assuming 1 full charge per day, that's 20W of energy consumed, and at electrical rates of $0.12/kWh that's $0.0024/day. Yes, it takes 1/4th of a penny to charge your phone. 57 years later, it'll pay for itself at $50/device. Of course if you live/work someplace with no/limited power, have sun every day, and are outdoors all the time, then this would work for you. Otherwise, it's just a handy every-now-and-then thing to have while camping or enjoying the outdoors.(Thanks to "Dan" for a correction on my numbers)Pros:- Has a pocket for various accessories.- Thick, rough burlap feel to the material - seems durable.- Two USB ports - though of course you'll be halving the charge between the two devices.Cons:- Pocket shouldn't be used to store the phone while charging. The whole case gets very hot. Perhaps this should have come with a mini umbrella or something to shade the phone.- It would have been nice to have something built into the case to support it at just the right angle. Instead I had to make do with a piece of wood or a few rocks to keep it up.- A bit heavy and large for light-weight backpacking, but it'll do just fine for campsites, boats, etc...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006ZRYU9O" id="B006ZRYU9O-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-22:</strong> This panel is small and light weight yet will put out some decent power to charge phones or tablets. Testing this during the summer months on a bright sunny day the iPhone will charge, but as soon as the output drops (clouds pass in front of the sun etc) the phone will stop charging. I paired this with aNew Trent iCarrier 12000mAh Portable Dual USB Port External Battery Charger/Power Pack for Smartphones, Tablets and more (Now w/Micro-USB charge port)as a source that charges during the day and then I use the battery pack to charge the electronics at night.The small size means it can go with you while camping or going any place. Folded up, this is about 8"x6"x1". The weight is about a pound. Unfolded you have three panels that send power to a small USB outlet located in a pouch on the backside of the panel. The pouch has room to store cords or a small USB battery charger.This is a great item to have for the price point. When used with a battery pack there is no problem keeping the phones and devices charged every night when we are at the camp, (which is off the grid).I would highly recommend this item to anyone needed a clean silent way to charge devices.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006ZRYU9O" id="B006ZRYU9O-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-23:</strong> I got this panel to use during power outages to keep the gadgets charged. It works. When the sun is out in force, it works pretty well. I've tested several cellphones (including 2 at a time) as well as a Kindle Fire HD, and it does in fact charge them all. If I could leave it at that then this would be a 5 star item.But it has a significant flaw. As others have mentioned, if there is any interruption in the solar input - a cloud passing in front of the sun, creeping shadows fron trees or fences later in the day - then the unit stops charging altogether. I found this to be very frustrating, as I have had to keep checking and moving the unit and charging devices far more frequently than I'd like. I don't want a panel that I have to babysit. You often don't know if it's stopped; everything can look perfectly fine, then you go and check it and it's where it was an hour ago because some random cloud cast a shade on the panel and shut the device's charging cycle off...If you have nice, bright sun all day long and a large open area where shadows will not be a problem, then this charger will work great, because it IS a capable charger in those conditions. If you don't have that then it can be frustrating. Does it still work? Yes, but you have to constantly check on it, resetting your devices (unplugging them and then plugging them back in) very frequently. Without this flaw I'd give it 5 stars, as it is I'd give it maybe 3.5. So it works, just not as great as I'd hoped.I would only recommend buying this one if you have a large open area that won't be affected by shadows. If you have that then by all means get this one, if not, there are other options.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006ZRYU9O" id="B006ZRYU9O-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-22:</strong> This seemed to be the best bang for the buck when it comes to solar chargers. 10W @ 5V =2 Amps of power max. So in direct light this thing should have no issue charging any USB device as the standard is 5V 1 Amp so it will have some power left over.Most USB battery backups that charge off of usb only take 1amp also so charging one of these should be no issue. I have a 4000mAh backup that it charges just fine. I am thinking of getting a 8000mAh USB chargeable and putting that inside the pouch always hooked up to the panel. That is one other nice feature, The USB ports are in a large pouch on the panel that has enough room for a backup battery pack and a cell phone to fit into.Now for low light charging is is best to not expect much in terms of charging a large capacity battery. However outside on the in the shade it was able to charge my Droid 3. And that is a power hungry phone.All the "solar chargers" with tiny panels on them are worthless, Do not even bother wasting money on them and get this instead.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006ZRYU9O" id="B006ZRYU9O-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-19:</strong> I have not used this daily, but have taken it on two camping trips so far.  It has charged my cell phone and my Samsung 7 inch tablet.  I tried doing both at once and was not thrilled with the speeds but one-on-one they did great.  Charged in approximately the same amount of time that it would off a wall wart.  Several times I have used this to charge my phone with the light coming through double paned glass and it has done just fine.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006ZRYU9O" id="B006ZRYU9O-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-03:</strong> Upon first inspection, this panel is smaller than I expected it to be (makes it easier to pack), it has several well-placed loops to attach it to a variety of items, and it seems to be made of that durable ballistic nylon that many of these panels are made of. I wouldn't say it's all-weather, but it looks like there was at least some thought put into its construction.My test conditions: Full sun (no clouds), within 1-2 hours of "solar noon" as determined by timeanddate.com for my location, and a little over a week after the summer solstice. This translates to about the best conditions I could expect in the field. I also tested after a few clouds rolled in and later again when it had clouded up considerably (perhaps 4-5 hours after "solar noon"). Note: my test location was at the IL/WI state line, so locations further south (toward the equator) might get better results while locations any further from the equator may be worse. To perform this test, I sacrificed an old USB cable, cut off the proprietary connector (for a device I no longer have) and stripped the red and black wires inside the cable and connected them to alligator clips. (This USB cable was not a data cable, so it did not have the four wires; only the two). Plugged the USB end into the panel and I then connected those red and black alligator clips to the red and black probes on my digital multimeter. Follow me so far? Is it the absolute best way to test output? Probably not. There some power loss possible in the several separate connections before it gets to the multimeter. But this was the cheapest method of testing the panel's output. (I was only using one of the two available USB ports on the panel at a time. I tested both, and they were about equal in results).Test results:1.779A x 5.21V = 9.27W (Full sun)1.57A x 5.24V = 8.23W (90% Sunny, wispy cumulous clouds)0.27A x 5.28V = 1.43W (70-80% Cloudy or Overcast)As you can see, it's not quite 10 watts. Part of the issue could be that this panel has a pretty good voltage regulator built in, so you're not sending more than a nominal increase over 5 volts into your device. I have another panel that over-performed its specs, but it also did not regulate the voltage as well as this one, as it fluctuated occasionally over 5.5 volts. This panel is rated for 2 amps at 5 volts. I would love to see the meter get into the 2's in the amperage, so I'll keep testing and probably update this review if I see a test result that puts this panel at or above 10 watts. I deducted one star for not meeting the advertised specs for now, but will update that as well if it does meet or exceed it in the future.For the size of this panel, it's pretty impressive and a good solar panel is a must-have if you want to keep your gizmos powered up while you're away from conventional power sources.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006ZRYU9O" id="B006ZRYU9O-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-23:</strong> The Instapark Solar Charger came to me all folded up in a box.  My very first impression is that it looked like a case for a Kindle Fire.  Open it up and it has three panels.  On the back is a pocket which stores two USB ports with enough room to keep a phone or other small device while charging.The first thing I tried to charge was my Kindle 3G . . . inside the car in the front seat on a sunny day.  I know instructions say direct sunlight, but I didn't want something screaming "electronic device" staring out the front window of my car.  That didn't work.Next, I tried putting it in the window of my home office.  This is a south facing window which gets very bright, though not direct, sunlight.  On this morning, it happened to be overcast.  I tried charging my children's spy watch.  No go.The sun came out and I decided I needed to go all out and put it in direct sunlight with the spy watch.  Voila!  A very quick charge.  It works!Now, since it was so bright outside, I tried charging both my Kindle 3G and myIncredicharge I-5000 External Battery Packthrough the front office window at the same time.  The Incredicharge charged extremely slowly.  The Kindle 3G still would not charge.Again, I brought the Instapark outside to charge the Incredicharge Battery in direct sunlight.  Whoa!  Another quick charge.One more time.  This time, I attempt to charge my Kindle 3G in direct sunlight.  It was outside all day.  I'd come out to check it every now and then.  Yes, it did charge, a little, very slowly.  After a full day, my Kindle 3G went from critically low battery levels to half charged.So, this Instapark Solar Charger does work very well for some devices.  It really does need direct sunlight.  It doesn't work so well in shaded or cloudy conditions.  I think I need something with a little more oomph to charge my Kindle 3G.  I like the portability, the pocket for storing small devices while charging, the "green" aspect, and the aesthetically appealing case.  It's a good idea for camping, but I would recommend trying it out before leaving.This product was provided for review by Instapark.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006ZRYU9O" id="B006ZRYU9O-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-25:</strong> So far this device has produced enough juice to charge my Bluetooth, and nothing else.

But in times where clouds can temporarily block the sun or a person or object can cast a shadow it will interrupt the charger and not always continue charging.Do yourself a huge favor and use this with a quality usb battery charger. Charge the battery pack with the solar charger and then charge whatever device you want with the battery pack and avoid leaving your device out in the hot sun.Now the one big problem I have with this solar charger is its durability. The solar panels will break/crack easy if you're not careful how you pack it and the panels have no protective cover or coating and scratch extremely easy which over time could possibly affect how well the panels can collect light. Just from opening and closing the panels they collected several swirl scratches.But for the price when compared to other similar solar chargers, this can't be beat.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006ZRYU9O" id="B006ZRYU9O-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-12:</strong> I love the idea of using solar energy panels to power my iPhone, iTouch, Kindle and Kindle Fire. These newer devices go through battery power at a much faster rate than our old devices.  So this Instapark 10 Watt Solar Panel Portable Solar Charger is a nice way to save on electricity costs and know that you're doing something good for the environment.This is a high quality solar charger with three panels measuring 19 x 9 inches. It's size is very handy since it folds into something that looks like a tablet cover measuring 6.6 x 9 inches when closed. It's made of a durable looking black material that has a velcro closure on one side and a pocket on the back which contains two USB ports and has enough room to keep a phone or other small device while charging.  It's lightweight and would fit easily in a backpack or briefcase or even in a good sized purse.  It's easy to take along.Since it was pretty hot here when I tested this, I used connector cords that came with the iPods and iPhones and tablets which were about 3 feet long so that I could keep the devices out of the sun.  I used a patio table with an umbrella and just moved the panel and devices as the sun moved.  It took less than 2 hours to charge an iPhone in full sun.  The amount of time it takes to charge something depends on the time of day and whether it's cloudy or clear.  Occasionally on a day when there were quite a few clouds my Kindle would stop charging and I'd have to unplug and plug it in again to get the charging re-started.  But in full sun there were no interruptions.I've also tried using this in the house, in front of a window with the sun streaming in and in  my car with the panel sitting on the dash (not moving) and it charged, but more slowly.  Because it folds, it's easy to prop the panel up in different directions to catch the sun later in the day.  This would be very handy when camping or hiking or when away from home and needing to charge any of these devices.  And I feel good about using energy from the sun and saving money in the process. After all of your devices are charged, and it's still sunny, you can store some of that energy by charging and external battery like theIncredicharge I-5000 External Battery Pack and Charger 5000mAh Capacity for Apple Iphone 4 4s iPod Touch (1G 2G 3G 4G 5G), Motorola Droid Razr MAXX, HTC Android EVO, Blackberry, Samsung EPIC, Samsung Galaxy Tablet, Samsung Galaxy S and Many More Devicesor theAnker Astro3 10000mAh Dual 2A USB Output External Battery Backup and Charger for iPhone 4S / 4 / 3GS, iPod, iPad, iPad 2, the New iPad (iPad 3); Most Android Phones (Samsung Galaxy S / S2 / S3, HTC One X One S Sensation EVO, Motorola Droid, LG Optimus,...].  These charge more slowly but it's a great way to be able to use some of that energy on a rainy day.I was provided a free sample of the device for testing and to provide an impartial review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006ZRYU9O" id="B006ZRYU9O-review21" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-25:</strong> I bought this to use while hiking and backpacking to keep things like camera, GoPro and GPS charged.  Just spent 6 days in the Grand Canyon and found that I wasted a lot of sunlight because everything charged so fast!For the most part, I kept this strapped to my pack hanging from top to bottom so that it would get sun while I hiked.  I then had it plugged into a 5000mAh battery pack that I would charge during the day, and would use the battery pack to charge devices once I was in camp.  Next day, recharge the battery pack.  There were several days we were at camp by 9 or 10am, so on those days I would set the charger in the sun and plug the battery pack AND a device like my GoPro or fellow hiker's iPods in to charge.  Charges rarely took more than 2 hours and usually were done in about an hour for partially charged devices.  The last 2 days of the hike I didn't even bother strapping it to my pack...it charged things so fast in camp that it was redundant.All in all, I'm very happy with this unit and I felt like I was wasting sunlight when not charging something.

Diffuse light doesn't work as well (for much of anything but pretty pictures).  I may be back to change my review after some use.  I am generally fairly careful with things (never broken a phone screen, or a phone at all, my last vacuum cleaner I got in high school lasted 25 years), and I've already got a big scratch on one of the panels.In short: works great, but be extra careful!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006ZRYU9O" id="B006ZRYU9O-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-30:</strong> I've been using this off & on now for about two months, and regret waiting so long before purchasing it. I honestly wish I'd taken the money I spent on little key chain & other spare batteries, and instead invested in things of this nature. Far less dead weight, far less detrimental to the earth, and far more reliable.Whether I'm up on a mountainside, or down in the city dealing with highrises, I'm almost always able to get a good charge from this. Depending on the sunlight & aim of the panels, I've managed to charge a Droid smartphone in about 2 hours, a Jensen SMPS600 speaker in about the same. Charging larger items like the Kindle Fire HD (7 inch) takes far longer, but it's still perfectly possible to charge, as well as another one or two smaller devices on the same day.The only thing I would change about this, and will look for in my next purchase of this sort, is for something more water-friendly. I've gotten this one damp, and had no problems. But I wouldn't want to submerge this, or ever leave it strapped on the outside of my pack if there's even a nominal chance of precipitation.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006ZRYU9O" id="B006ZRYU9O-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-11:</strong> My dad is a missionary and was planning on making a trip to spend two months out in the jungles of Papua New Guinea with some tribes.  He planned to show films in their native language using a Optoma PK102 PICO Pocket Projector and a HMDX battery powered speaker.  There is no electricity where he was going so he needed a way to recharge his equipment that was portable because they had to get to the villages over land on foot through the mountains.After much searching, I settled on this unit.  I am happy to say that this device worked better then expected.  He was able to show more then 2 hours of video each night for the two months he was back in the jungle off of just the power he got from this unit during the day.  I set him up with New Trent 12000mAh external power pack, which he used this solar panel to charge during the day.  He then used the power pack to charge and run his equipment at night.  He said that on a good sunny day, this panel could fully charge the 12000mAh power pack in about 6 hours.  Honestly, I thought he might be able to show a movie every couple of days, but that was not the case.  This unit out performed my expectations.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B006ZRYU9O', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B006ZRYU9O', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B003X9VHOI</h2>    <p class="price"> $B003X9VHOI</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

I am going to order a purple one right now....</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B007OZRGY2', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B007OZRGY2', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B0071FWDHK</h2>    <p class="price"> $B0071FWDHK</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

It was a go phone and I know how warranties go so I didn't get one. I figure phones will only last me about two years and then it's time for a new one..I got shorted a year. That phone was a ZTE something..which was also a android go phone.I'm not much of techy, I'm pretty much a "cell retard" so here it goes.So far what I like about this phone.The sound is good as far as calls and video quality is pretty good.I upload to Facebook/Youtube/Instagram pretty fastThe picture quality is good, especially outside or well lit areas (I have no idea how to adjust anything, so I just snap and roll with what I get)There are lots of apps already on the phone..of which again I have no idea what they are for instance Pops? and I could do without Uno or Bejeweled as well as a couple of other apps that are on there.I love my GPS..if you have been reading so far...I tend to be lost a lotAs for the phone so far the only thing I don't like is the position of the camera there should be another button on the side or something to make it easier to take pics of myself...I'm very vain, I can't find the button when I can't see it, and I'm trying to get my pose on. Oh and this one I have not figured out how to turn the camera sound off. So it's hard for me to sneak pics of my friends acting up.So far I like the phone, I haven't read the book and I pretty much just play with it to figure out what it does. Simple enough for me.The only thing I could complain about is the ATT SERVICE IN MY AREA WHICH SUCKS!!UPDATE**********08/26/13YAY ME!! I finally figured out how to silence my camera..by silencing the whole darn phone.I also figured out that I do not like the fact that I don't have the option of multi-select when I am deleting my phone log. Either you delete them one by one or keep them all.Also, I don't like that when I delete certain messages in a thread it takes me way to the top of the thread, but maybe that I can deal with.#ATT SERVICE IN MY AREA STILL SUCKS..phone is fine.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009CEZGKE" id="B009CEZGKE-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-15:</strong> Got this for the wife as a secret Anniversary gift.

Imagine telling someone from just 50 years ago that you could have a device with which you could access all the world's knowledge or play games, could help you communicate to nearly anyone in the solar system and take pictures of them with a decent camera that you could share with everyone else in the solar system, could entertain with music, movies, or audiobooks, can track your exact location and speed using GPS while you're beating Kenyans in a street race, and most importantly of all, let you get see the latest from your favorite Internet celebrity cat. Then imagine that you tell him it only takes a couple hours of work to make the money to pay for it.This phone is the phenomenal. Of course, it's not the best phone out there--the iPhone or the Galaxy SIII take the cake on that, but unlike its predecessor (ATT Fusion 1), it actually works and it works pretty well at that. The storage and memory seem to allow you to do everything that you want to do. You can't store a billion songs on it, but you can store several audiobooks. And the keyboard is infantile compared to the Apple keyboard, but it's not a deal breaker for what I need this puppy for.I can maintain my Google Voice/Skype/GoPhone system and save hundreds of dollars on my phone bill every year (read my books for more on this dandy) and still accomplish everything I want. It's utter brilliance.

Since his contract doesn't expire until the devil freezes over, I researched some Go-Phones. We were able to place this under the account we already had instead of using it as a pre-paid with no problems. Compared to the iphone 4 it seems made of cheaper material, feels flimsy, and doesn't seem as "cool" to me. But for him, it's a phone and he's already playing games and downloading apps.For the price compared to a full replacement, I'm happy!*note* if you purchase this phone, you need to get additional chargers for home and car.Will update in the future.7/12/13-- (wow, that was fast)--One other reviewer said they had to turn off/on their phone a few times a day. After receiving the message "The person you are trying to reach is not accepting calls at this time" I was able to contact my son via my ipad and have him turn the phone off and on.

I bought this phone for my teenage son basically for emergencies and texting and he loves it. Granted, it has only been up and running for a few days but we have not noticed any problems with it so far.  I will update my review after he has been using it for a few months and let you know how the performance has been.I too am one of those who inserted the old SIM card into this phone and do not use a data plan (you can actually disable mobile data on it) so this will work.  Some things I really like about this phone:  The phone has awesome graphics and a camera.  The screens swipe to view additional screens.  It does have a device lock which is a bonus for teenagers trying to maintain their privacy.I don't want to dis anyone but I do have a comment for others who compare this phone to an iPhone or any other high end smartphone (apples to oranges) and that is, simply put, that you get what you pay for.  Pay as you go is a cheap plan with cheap phones. It is unfair to compare them to an iPhone or any other smartphone, they can't even compete.  It's not going to do the things a high end smartphone can do and it's not going to perform like a high end smartphone because it's not.  I am an HTC One X user and I can honestly say that I am very impressed with this phone.  Great starter smartphone for anyone and I highly recommend it - so far!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B009CEZGKE', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B009CEZGKE', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B000JHKU72</h2>    <p class="price"> $B000JHKU72</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

A big plus is that you can use it as a passive headset by plugging in a 3.5 mm audio cable.

Sound quality is much better than with tiny in-the-ear devices.Comfort and battery life is also excellent -- I charge mine overnight and wear it all day long.Cautions:Extending and retracting the adjustable headband should be done with care.  I pulled mine out a little too quickly once and it came apart.  Fortunately, nothing was broken and I was able to carefully reassemble it with no harm done.When pairing, it helps to hold the headset within a few inches of the PC bluetooth antenna.Rants:The "Features" list includes "Wired connection for use with all stereo MP3 players."  However, the cable necessary for this to work is not included.  To be fair, it isn't listed in "What's In the Box", either.Range is a little disappointing.

To my surprize they are rather large, but hey they fit better than my Sony BT22 headset. I guess as long as your listen to your music they don't look so crazy wearing them outside.Now sound quality is not bad. The ear piece really blocks out outside noise, which help hear your music or the person on the phone that you are talking to. I asked a friend if could hear me ok after we finshed talking. They said I was loud and clear. Then I told them that I was on my new bluetooth headset. They was like really I couldn't tell.The controls are very easy to remember how to control the music and the phone. After wearing them for a while they do cause a little discomfort, but I'm sure anything you have over your head in time is going to get a little uncomfortable. But all in all I like them. Hell you can't beat the price. I know for a fact that you go inside a retail store and but these you looking at $100 easy.If you don't mond the bulkyness they are a good buy.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000JHKU72" id="B000JHKU72-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2008-07-13:</strong> Finally, after 4 tries, I have found a set of bluetooth wireless headphones that I can actually live with.Are they perfect - NO!  I'll get into the pros and cons below, but first I've got to say that when I started my quest to purchase a decent sounding, less than a 100 lbs, and less than a fortune set of wireless headphone, I did not expect it to be this difficult.For my music source I purchased the Verizon ENV2, and added an 8 GB chip.I first ordered the JBL 610 ($125). While they paired up perfectly, they sounded much too tinny and felt cheap. Return # 1.Next I ordered the top-of-the line Sony DRBT50 ($165). These were light weight, felt great, and when I got stereo, they sounded wonderful. Unfortunately, they would not stay in stereo mode, kept reverting back to mono. Also, the controls were badly placed and I kept hitting the controls when I put them on. Return # 2.Next came the Jabra BT8030 ($137). They paired easily and sounded very nice (they have chip enhanced bass). Also - they turn into stand-alone speakers and they really sound great in that mode. The sound level actually doubles. Unfortunately, they weighted about a ton and I felt really stupid when I walked around the mall with them on. Oh yea, the ad claimed 32 hours of use between charges, but once I got them the specs said 7-8 hours. Big difference. I thought about keeping them for the stand-alone stereo - but - back they went. Return # 3.That's when I gave up and bought a pair of Bose wired headphone (the cheap $150 pair). They sounded great and lightweight - but once I got them on the plane I remembered why I wanted wireless phones. I kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off. So after a couple of weeks of this, I decided to try one more time. I kept the Bose for the office.I purchased the Motorola S805, basically out of sheer desperation. They were only $88 at Amazon (I love Amazon!), and free shipping, so I gave them a try. Surprisingly, they paired easily and sounded really good.  They were not especially light weight, but fit fine on my head and were not all that heavy (8 oz). No glitches the first 3 days, then all at once I went to turn them off, and they went in pairing mode and the only way to get them out was to plug in the charger. A couple of more days went by and one morning they would not turn on (had plenty of charge). So I decided they were defective, and I sent them back and got a replacement pair. After about 3 days with the replacement set, once again they went into pairing mode, and then later would not turn on. Hum, if it happened the same way twice, then it probably was not a defect but something I was doing wrong. So I experimented with them for a few days and figured it out. Here goes: If you follow the instructions when turning them off and wait until after all 3 flashing lights before releasing the on/off button, they will go into pairing mode. If you release the button as soon as the first flash happens, they turn off. A quirk, but, given my history and desperation, not all that hard to live with. Next, why would they not turn on sometimes? I found this one by accident. I went to turn off the headphones, but forgot to first press the music play/stop button, just turned off the phones. That did it, they would not turn back on until I plugged in the charger and "reset" them. Okay, for most people that would be enough to "send them back" but I really want wireless headphones so I am keeping them.A few other observations:(1) I tested the charge time and so far they've gone 16 hours on a single charge, and they were still working. They are rated at 17 hours. Charge takes almost exactly 3 hours.(2) A big pro is the case, hard shell and very nice. Room to store the charger and supplied wired cable.(3) They transition seemlessly from stereo headphones to hands-free phone headset. When you hear the ring tone, just press the Phone button and you are talking. Clear as a bell. Not sure how my voice is coming through, but have not received any complaints so I assume it is clear as well. When you are finished with your call, press the phone button again, and you are back to music in a couple of seconds. The music is paused so you don't miss a note.(4) The ad says they reduce noise and echo, but I did not find either of these to be true. Background noise is not noticably reduced, and there is a noticable echo when walking in the mall. Does not really bother me, but you should be aware of this. Haven't tried them on the plane yet.(5) Controls: I like the placement of the controls. Took me only a couiple of days be become an expert at lowering or raising the music volume (a wheel), skipping or repeating a song (a different wheel), pausing (quick push of a button), or answering the phone (quick push of a differnt button).Okay, that's about it. I will keep them and I do recommend them if you don't mind dealing with a quirk or two. Besides, $88 (now $79 I see) isn't all that much money to be the first on your block to own some new high-tech gadget.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000JHKU72" id="B000JHKU72-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-01-07:</strong> My purpose for buying the S805 headphones was to hook them up to my Home Theater so that I could watch movies, hear the PS3, and listen to music all in one place.Most of the other reviews cover the product fairly well, so I will mention the one thing that made a difference for me: the Bluetooth transmitter.I had the Jabra Bluetooth Music Adaptor (A120s) and figured since my Motorola S9 Headphones worked fine with it; then these Motorola S805 headphones should work fine as well. I was wrong. After spending close to an hour of transfers, hang ups, and poor English, I finally got an answer from someone at Motorola's support line: "The S805 is not compatible with your transmitter." I asked them in return, "do you sell a transmitter that will work with them?" for which their reply was, "Only one that works with an iPod."So, I had to find another alternative. Someone here at Amazon mentioned in their review that they used the Sony Bluetooth Transmitter Adaptor (TMR-BT10A) with success. I broke down and ordered this, investing more than I had intended, but was pleased to find that the Motorola S805 headphones indeed work with this Sony Transmitter. I haven't used it much to do further testing, but it seems to work fine at close range; walking out of the room cuts the signal in and out, and if it totally drops you have to re-sync it. But I'm usually sitting on the couch, less than 10 feet away, and so far it works like a charm.So to sum-up:1) Jabra Bluetooth Music Adaptor (A120s) = does not work with the Motorola S8052) Sony Bluetooth Transmitter Adaptor (TMR-BT10A) = does work with the Motorola S805If there are others, I'm not aware of them.Other things to note on transmitters:1) My Bluetooth dongle on the computer did not connect these headphones either. My understanding is that you must have an A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile) compatible dongle for it to work.2) The PS3 may have connected the device, but I didn't try as after some research, I learned that the system does not play game sounds and music through the Bluetooth connection. It is only good for talking back and forth with other gamers. Hopefully Sony adds this feature in the future.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000JHKU72" id="B000JHKU72-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2008-06-05:</strong> Pros:* Nice sound* Good feel on the head* Rotating cups are nice for mixing (during practice, not live, see below)* Headset comes with a really nice carrying caseCons:* They are extremely difficult to pair with any device. Every time I use them I have to spend five to ten minutes just trying to get the headphones into pairing mode and to actually pair with the host device. Motorola used the horrible "one button does it all" interface for operating power and pairing, even though there are two buttons on the headset.* The other button on the other side of the headset is useless because it's proprietary.  It's supposed to pause/play music but it doesn't work with any device I've ever paired the headphones with.* The little rubber flap that covers the USB and audio input plugs is always falling out and hanging lopsided.* The headphones say on the package and in adverts that you can connect a headphone cable to another device to listen instead of using Bluetooth, but they don't tell you that the cable has to be Motorola's "special" headphone cable, which you have to order from Motorola.  You can't just go to the store and buy a iPod headphone cable to use with the headphones like you can with most other devices.*The fabric on the inside of the headband is nice for keeping your head from sweating but it causes carpet burns on the back of your neck if you wear the headphones around your neck.*Not recommended for DJs (trust me, I am one) because you can never be sure how long the battery is going to last, as there's no battery meter. You really don't want your headphones to quit on you in the middle of a live show.* When the batteries get low there's a series of three beeps then an ear-bursting *POP* noise.  I wrote to Motorola to complain and ask if the issue could be fixed, but they responded by sending me another set of the same headphones which had the same problem. The only workaround is to quickly jerk the headphones off of your head when you hear the three beeps to avoid hurting your ears with the loud pop noise.* There's a really bright LED light that fades on and off while the headphones are receiving audio that you can't disable, on each side of the headphones.  It's kind of neat for about the first five minutes then it gets annoying.* The minimum volume is still sometimes too loud.* Default volume at power on is always too loud.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000JHKU72" id="B000JHKU72-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-11-12:</strong> I was looking for a decent and cheap set of bluetooth headphones for my Macbook Pro and came upon these. After reading some of the reviews, I thought it wouldn't be such a bad buy considering the price. As the title says, these headphones do not work well with a Macbook Pro. Sure it will connect and everything, but the bluetooth setup that apple has on these laptops suck. I mean, the sound has a lot of static and cuts out. I'm not sure if its OSX that's the problem or the bluetooth radio but all I know is that the sound coming from the headphones just did not sound nice. At this point I wondered if it was the headphones or the computer. So I switched to my Compaq running Windows XP and lo and behold it sounded incredible. No static, no cutouts, nothing. The sound was crisp on both bass and treble songs. It was easy to connect and was running A2DP. I can bet that most people who rated these headphones poorly either had a non A2DP compatible source or was using a Macbook Pro. So even though I enjoy my Mac, all I can say is that apple skimps out on small things like bluetooth and to some people that means a lot. Overall the headphones were comfortable and felt very solid. The charge time is long (3 hours), but is definitely worth it. I have yet to try these with a A2DP cellphone so sorry if I don't review call quality and such. Even with my problem with my Macbook Pro, I thought that it wasn't the headphone quality that affected the sound, it was the computer and that shouldn't affect the overall rating of the headphones, so I rated these 5 stars.Pros:Cheap!Sound is impressive on both treble and bass. Stereo SoundSturdy constructionComfortable fitEasy to connect, just read the instructionsLong battery lifeCons:Doesn't work well with a Macbook ProLong charge timeMake sure you have A2DP on your computer or cellphone. This does affect the sound quality.Hopefully this review is helpful</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000JHKU72" id="B000JHKU72-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-09-28:</strong> This is the best bluetooth headset I've owned in terms of comfort and sound quality.

So far, here's my experience:+ Positives ++ Loooooooong battery life+ Comfortable enough to wear 6+ hours at a time+ Good sound quality+ Easy controls for volume, etc+ Around $30.  One of the cheapest I've found for bluetooth headset+ Noise cancellation works...if you have music going (why have them on if you don't!)- Negatives -- Wall charger that came with them was a MICRO usb charger, not the MINI usb charger that it requires.  However, I had plenty of mini usb cables, which I used to charge them with from my PCOverall, these bluetooth headphones are and excellent value - would definitely recommend...especiall for the $30.Final note, these do not come "packaged."  They arrive in your box inside of a plastic bag with the wall charger (probably the wrong type), the headphones, and the "manual".</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B000JHKU72', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B000JHKU72', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00C80S4W6</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00C80S4W6</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

Even before installing the screen protectors, I knew it was good quality just from the feel in the hand. These protectors are more of a second screen rather than just a sheet of a plastic.Like all protectors they can be tricky to install, so be sure to read the instructions on the back of the package. After reading the instructions they go on like a piece of cake. The first step is to clean the screen with the enclosed lint free cloth. I find it best to position the screen around the camera and sensor first.While applying the screen protector use the smoothing card (squeegee) to firmly affix it to the screen. There may be some small air bubbles, they will disappear within a day or two. Once all of these steps you have completed, you will have a phone screen that will safely protected.These screen protectors are step above the rest because of their special features. Which are: anti-fingerprint; scratch resistant; anti-bubble; super clear; oil-resistant. This lets me know they have the customer in mind.The best part of this kit beside the great screen protector, is the smoothing card (squeegee) that is made out of plastic and not cardboard like the other cheap ones on the market.CONTENTS:Illumishield Screen Protectors (3x)Smoothing CardLint-Free Polishing ClothInstructions (Back Of Package)I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C80S4W6" id="B00C80S4W6-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-05:</strong> Very,very well made.

I bought one of the 3500mah extended batteries from ebay since the seidio ones are so expensive. I wanted to get a case that would fit and this seidio one is the only one I found that might fit. So I took a chance and bought it. It comes very close to fitting, but the battery cover is just slightly too wide. I knew there was a chance it wouldn't fit, and now that I know it doesn't I'm going to buy the official seidio battery soon. But I wanted to make sure I reviewed this so anyone else that had the same idea could read this and know ahead of time that it won't fit. Other than that it is a great case and will look great once I get the right battery.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005C3MTEA" id="B005C3MTEA-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-27:</strong> Got this POS for my evo 3D, thought it would work.

I enjoy the case but I've dropped my phone a couple of times since owning it. It did its job, my phone is fine, however the case chips apart with each fall. The corner clips that hold the case in place have a habit of snapping off after a hit.Bottom line, definitely does the job but be prepared to replace it after a drop or two.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005C3MTEA" id="B005C3MTEA-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-08:</strong> I've been using this about a month and a half now. The back is great, the corner protection works fine, the phone feels the right size to my hand, but the power button cover is terrible beyond words.There's no real definition to the power button, so you're never certain if you're pressing to the right or the left of the thing. If you don't get it dead on you're not waking your phone up. This is not so much an issue if you're looking at your phone, but if you are driving and you need to make a call, well, good luck with that.The other problem this suffers from is there are no touch cues for which way is up. If you're fumbling blind, driving, etc, there's not a heck of a lot of differentiation between the upside and the downside.The case does a great job of protecting the dual cameras, but man the power button is just killing me.I like most of Seido's products, have since the EVO 4G, but am not a fan of this one</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005C3MTEA" id="B005C3MTEA-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-04:</strong> This is a very good case for the extended (4000mah in my case) battery for the Evo 3D. The extended battery does add a huge amount of bulk to the phone and this does add a bit more but its not too much.Mobility:I keep my phone in my pants pocket and have had no issues getting this in/out. The silicon sleeve part of the cover is not "sticky" (for lack of a better word) so it does not pull my pocket inside-out when removing the phone.Quality:The silicon sleeve part is very sturdy and the hard outer shell holds the silicon sleeve on very well. I almost dropped the phone once and ended up catching it by accidentally just grabbing onto the silicon and it did not rip of feel like it was going to break.Accessories:I use the Seidio Desktop Dock and this is fully compatible with that, no issues and its a nice snug fit.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B005C3MTEA', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B005C3MTEA', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li>
