I am so glad that I ignored the negative reviews. I love the blue tooth and I couldn't be happier. It was very simple to connect to my phone. The features are very simple to use. I love the feature if I move away from my phone the blue tooth lets me know. There has been no complaints that I can't be heard nor do I have a problem hearing with whom I am speaking. The blue tooth is very easy to slip on my ear. Since the charger is the same one I use for my phone I don't have to use different chargers.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004M180HS" id="B004M180HS-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-18:</strong> I bought two of these from Cellularboys. In the past months I had bought two more from other seller. The headsets work great with a Galaxy S and a Blackberry. I never tested connecting two devices at the same time.Unfortunately, for this latter order, one of the headsets did not work out of the box. The microphone does not work, I can hear the other person but they cannot hear me. The items were taken outside the US, so sending the defective item for exchange is not an option.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004M180HS" id="B004M180HS-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-12:</strong> Great reception and noise control.

Although the price was $18.00, I was skeptical about its performance, since the Plantronics costs $150.00.Pros:*The Samsung HM1100 Bluetooth headset worked well and its battery life was exceptional.*I liked that I could use my micro UBS charger in my car to charge the headset when the battery is drained.*The unit was very light.*The sound quality was good, but not exceptional. People could hear me well, but I could not hear them well if it is noisy in the car.Cons:*The headset was not comfortable.  It keeps falling off my ear.*The sound quality was good, but not exceptional. People could hear me well, but I could not hear them well if it is noisy in the car.I would still get this headset as a cheap replacement for a second car but not as a main headset.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004M180HS" id="B004M180HS-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-19:</strong> i use this with my galaxy note 2 and works fine, arrived on time and in good conditions no regrets to buy this thing.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004M180HS" id="B004M180HS-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-06-07:</strong> I am not sure if its the phone or the headset but it seems to have a hard time understanding what someone says to voice dial.

In this case I received both. This headset is a basic design but for me functions perfectly, just what I needed.

I had previously purchased a Samsung HM1000 Bluetooth Wireless Headset, on 5-28-11, I was thinking this would be an upgrade, but this product also has the same feedback problem. I won't be purchasing anymore Samsung Bluetooths!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004M180HS" id="B004M180HS-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-10:</strong> It worked for a day or two when i first got it. Not well but it worked. Then all of the sudden it started giving off a loud buzzing feedback to whomever i was talking to on the other end. Asked Seller for a refund/exchange. We will see what happens.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004M180HS" id="B004M180HS-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-20:</strong> The unit itself works fine but it was not that comfortable for long periods - I could feel it the whole time.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004M180HS" id="B004M180HS-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-26:</strong> I bought this as a budget option for my wife and she likes it. It has an on/off switch which leaves not doubt as to when the device is powered on or off. The lack of movable parts, unlike my Motorola H15, is a bonus for her. So far reception has been good and it holds the charge as advertised. The only complaint is there is not enough volume at max if you a driving in a car with windows down, or perhaps a convertible.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004M180HS" id="B004M180HS-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-24:</strong> I have been using this headset with my Samsung Exhibit II Android phone, as well as previously with another cell phone.It works okay.  There is a volume up and down switch, a power switch, and a control button to answer or redial the last number called.  That's it - anything more complex and you have to use the phone directly.I keep the volume on max ALL the time because it is so quiet.  I can hear ok when there's no ambient noise, but often I have trouble hearing due to traffic noise etc.The main issue I have is the ear buds (the rubber piece around the speaker that holds it in your ear) tend to fall off if you aren't careful.  Several times I've put it in my pocket with my wallet only to pull it out later without the ear bud.  Another time it fell off while in my car's cupholder.  Usually I could find it, but not always.The ear HOOK stays on - it's the piece that goes around the ear - but you can't really use this without the ear bud also.  It came with a couple different shaped ear buds (for different size ear canals), but all are now gone.Unfortunately, Samsung no longer covers this under warranty.  When I first called they said they would replace the whole unit.  Instead, I switched to another less comfortable ear bud.  When that one fell off, I called back but now they won't replace it, and said they don't sell replacement ear buds.  So the headset is now useless.This would be a nice headset if the volume were louder, the ear buds stayed on better, and you had more control over the phone from the headset.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004M180HS" id="B004M180HS-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-19:</strong> i love it,i use to have a Motorola blutooth and everybody i talked to with it said it was all muffled and now with my new samsung blutooth no one even knows i'm using a blutooth all is well in Virginia,very happy with this product.....</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B004M180HS', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B004M180HS', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B007IXLQ7S</h2>    <p class="price"> $B007IXLQ7S</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

This case fits the bill. It's small and fits comfortably in my pockets and it's easy to maneuver throw the different screens on my phone with just one hand. The button cutouts also allow for easy access. I haven't dropped my phone so I'm not sure how much protection it will provide but I'm usually pretty careful with my phones.

The inside lip of the case is a little sharp and interferes with the Spiggen curved screen protector. Occasionally when handling the phone, this case will peel up part of the screen protector. My workaround has been to scrape the inside lip with a sharp blade to deburr it. This has mostly fixed the issue.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089CH2S4" id="B0089CH2S4-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-20:</strong> Good to have another protective cover .... breaks up the one color .... and it gives a nice contrast to your natural phone color ....</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089CH2S4" id="B0089CH2S4-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-28:</strong> I love this case.

I had to find a small plastic container to place it in while not in use, so it would not be squished in my purse.  My family and friends often complain about how well they can hear me while I use the bluetooth, but it happens randomly.  The piece that is supposed to fit in your ear and keep it in place will start to turn after multiple uses, so I stopped using it.

I previously owned a Jawbone ICON, and when it met its premature death (they are definitely not Rottwelier resistant), I wanted to replace it with the same model. This appeared to be the updated version of my previous unit.=== The Good Stuff ===* This unit has one button, which seems to do what I want it to do whenever I press it. It also has a little slide switch for ON/OFF, which again does exactly what I would expect it to do. For my use, there is no need for the &#34;press the big button three times while holding the little button&#34; gymnastics that other headsets seem to require.* I find the sound quality to be at least as good as my Verizon cell connection. The noise reduction seems to work reasonably well at not picking up ambient noises, and the earpiece volume is more than sufficient for my needs.* It comes with a variety of earpieces, one of which works well in my ear. My ear canals are evidently on the small side, and this is one of the few headsets that both stays in my ear (without the hook) and is comfortable to wear, at least for an hour or two.=== The Not-So-Good Stuff ===* I hate the retail packaging. It takes some effort to break into the thing. But even worse is that the hard plastic shell is useless for storing all the extra ear pieces that come with the headset. Instead there is a cardboard box that really doesn't stay closed on its own.* The case is also useless as a storage container for the headset. Instead, I use an old prescription pill bottle, which works pretty well and protests the headset from damage in my briefcase.=== Summary ===I have found Jawbone ICONs to be rock-solid, relatively low cost headsets. They pair easily with my iPhone, and the sound quality is fine for my uses. All the functions I care about (easy to pair, one button call/hangul, on-screen battery meter) all work well with no fuss, and I have never looked up anything in the manual. It doesn't have (I assume) all the latest, coolest features, but I don't really want them anyway.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005MHGBX6" id="B005MHGBX6-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-13:</strong> I read a lot of reviews on this before I forked out the cash.

Whether it's iTunes or Pandora, the sound is good. I recently had to participate in a conference call using the headset and I was able to hear everyone on the call pretty well. Honestly it's hard to be able to hear everything on a conference call to begin with, so I was happy with that.I like that it fits right into my ear, but also has the over the ear hook thing. With my previous headset I was always fighting with the hook getting tangled in my glasses. :o) There are multiple pieces to fit into your ear which I think one of those will work for most people.

Over the last month or so I have tried four different headsets until I finally found one that met all of my needs. I am including my brief opinions about each of them for comparison, and to hopefully help some of you narrow your selection down, if you are considering any of these.MOTOROLA H720PROS: Easy to use, flip to talk makes answering calls easy. Comfortable.CONS: Floppy feel. Noise canceling does not work very well.MOTOROLA HX550PROS: Flip to talk makes answering calls relatively easy. Its Comfortable. Noise canceling works very well while on calls.CONS: Noise canceling does not work for voice commands...so forget about using Siri while driving. The compact nature of this headset makes it more difficult to flip open than the H720.PLANTRONICS M165PROS: It looks good. Deep sleep mode means you don't need to turn it on and off every time you want to use it.CONS: Noise canceling not nearly as good as either the HX550 or any of the Jawbone headsets.JAWBONE 2:PROS: Noise canceling works very well, both for calls and voice commands.CONS: Hidden buttons are hard to use. Plastic cover over buttons eventually fatigues and cracks. Turning on headset requires holding hidden button down for three seconds, followed by another three seconds to connect to the phone, causing missed calls.JAWBONE ICON HD:PROS: Noise canceling works well, both for calls and voice commands. Single multi-function button is MUCH easier to find and use than on the Jawbone 2. Power switch is easier to use than the hidden button on the J2. Time to connect to an incoming call from power-off is about 1 second, so no more missed calls. 10 days of standby time, so probably won't turn it off anyway. "mytalk.jawbone.com" provides an easy to use interface to the headset. Downloadable voice personalities are fun. Ability to reconfigure multi-function button for volume control or enabling/disabling Noise Assassin is nice.CONS: Slightly less comfortable to wear than HX550 or M165 in-the-ear, but not bad for short duration. Would probably use over-the-ear hook for extended use.UPDATE (2/4/2014):I have been using the Jawbone Icon HD for over two months now and love it. This is the standard by which all other Bluetooth headsets should be measured. Absolutely no complaints at all...small, comfortable, easy to use, and superb noise canceling for both voice commands and phone conversations. This headset costs about twice as much as most entry level headsets, but you truly get what you pay for in this case. Many of the high-end headsets cost about twice as much as this one, and I can't imagine being any happier with them. Excellent value.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005MHGBX6" id="B005MHGBX6-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-30:</strong> Even though it received very high ratings, I had a difficult time getting it to fit my ear and also had a lot of comments from people I was calling of &#34;echoes or feedback&#34;.

Always the same problem:  either they only work for a short period of time because the tiny wires inside break, or they simply do not work straight out of the box.  I am sure everyone else out there can say pretty much the same thing.So, I was skeptical about these, but honestly, there isn't a cord on the market that does not raise my suspicions in regards to its quality.I was pleasantly surprised at these as soon as I opened the package because of the weighty feel of them.  I do know that I am personally responsible for damaging a lot of our cords (there are 4 of us in my house who all use the same type of charger cords, so when the cords no longer work, it's hard to tell which one of us is responsible for breaking it) because I have a hard time grasping the part of the cord where it is wide and flat--I don't know what it's called, but the part you pull on when you are trying to unplug the device--that part is usually where the wires inside break.  I have bite marks on that flat part I just mentioned on my cords from pulling with my teeth in an attempt to not pull on the cord itself, which would risk damaging it.  Crazy, right?!  Well, these cords have an extra heavy duty feel to them, and that wide part?  Well, it is bigger!  A lot bigger!!  And I can actually unplug my phone without pulling on the cord or using my teeth!!  WOO HOOO!!The only problem I have is that they are so heavily made, that they are thicker than any other charger I have ever used and I don't have a single device that can be charged without removing part of the case because the cases are made for the standard Apple charger size.I am thinking I will purchase the adapter thingy that you use for lifeproof cases, which will solve my problem there.Thank you for such a great product!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00B45TMTK" id="B00B45TMTK-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-04:</strong> Five white and five black Velcro cable ties are in this package.

With my custom non-apple cover removed, it fits snugly and charges away. It doesn't charge as quickly as the Apple one, but the trade off in length and price is worth it to me. I do not blame the product that my cover prevents it from charging -- only the Apple brand fits in there, and none of the non-Apple ones do. I think this is an excellent value. I didn't give it 5 stars only because it charges about 75% as well as the more expensive Apple charger.

It must have been their time:&#62;)  I also managed to crack the housing on 2 Belkin cables.  I needed replacements and I needed cables that would put up with everything! These cables are tanks!  They are well built and meant to LAST. Really, these things have tolerated all kinds of crazy shoving, weather and temperature changes that go along with camping, dogs, and, well, life!  That said, the Apple connector plastic end&#8230;not the metal but the plastic shroud is slightly larger than the Apple brand shroud.  It works perfectly with all my leather cases for my iphone and iPad.  One silicone case I carry strictly for grip while camping just needed to be filed slightly to make room.  I used a round metal craft file to make the tiny bit of extra room I needed for the connector.  That little bit of extra plastic, which makes the cable that much more indestructible, makes it just a tiny bit too big to fit through the hole to plug the phone in while it is in the case.  Just check your current case while an Apple connector is in place.  If there is a bit of room around the plastic shroud you should be fine.  Good luck!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00B45TMTK" id="B00B45TMTK-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-23:</strong> I guess I must be hard on cables.  Mine seem to quit working much sooner than I expect.  I keep buying cables that SAY they work with iPad 3, but when they arrive my iPad says it is not compatible and will not charge my device!  I can't recall how many times this has happened since I got the iPad 3.  Those other cables work fine with the iPad 2, but not the 3.I just got these cables today, so I can not yet speak to the longevity, nor to the companies 'Lifetime' warranty, but I can say that it IS charging my iPad 3!!!  I was a little confused with the description because it stated that the cables would work with iPad 3, but then it said it would not work with Retina display??  I thought all iPad 3 had the retina display? Mine does.  I do not have the 8 pin connector of which they speak. I have only the 30 pin that looks identical to iPad 2 connectors.Anyway, I am very pleased with these cables so far.  I have only tried one of the three.  It appears to be well constructed, heavy duty and extra long. Most importantly, it IS charging my iPad 3!  Now if they honor their lifetime guarantee, I should be set for life - no more searching for iPad cables YEAH!I will update this review if anything changes, or when I need a warranty replacement.

The end caps were also fatter than the Apple 30-pin connector cable that comes with your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. Some people (me included) were also having a loose plug issue where the 30-pin connector was not staying in the device securelyTo address the problems, The Friendly Swede had new and improved cables produced to replace their original cables. Sadly, I do not notice any difference between these and the cables I already had. My video demonstrates the issues that I had and the issues that still remain.I like the cables. They seem to be well made and are generously lengthy which comes in handy for me. But I dislike that I have to remove the case on my iPhone in order to charge it. Also, the 30-pin connector is not as secure in my iPhone and iPad as the original Apple connector. I'll think my devices are charging and I'll notice eventually that the connector loosened up on me and in fact the device was not charging.I was provided a complimentary set of cables for testing and review. I agreed to provide a fair and honest review. If you have any questions, please leave me a comment and I'll answer if I can.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00B45TMTK" id="B00B45TMTK-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-19:</strong> I've had my iPhone 4s for about a year now, and the only charging cable I had was the short, fragile, skinny white one that came with it.  It works fine, but it was always such a hassle never being able to talk on the phone or browse while it was charging because of the shortness of the cable.  It never even dawned on me to look for a cable long enough to allow me to use my phone while charging.  What a difference!  The cable is much thicker and, I assume therefore, much more durable than the one that came with the phone.This package of cables comes in beautiful pink, purple, and turquoise blue colors.  I gave the purple one to my granddaughter who is always losing her charger, kept the pink one for myself, and gave the turquoise cable to my husband.  He loves the fact that this cable is bright enough that he can find it in his truck and also will be much less likely to leave it in hotel rooms or on the train.Finally, with that all said, it works exactly as it should.  A great product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00B45TMTK" id="B00B45TMTK-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-24:</strong> First off I want to make clear that I will always purchase from this seller because they go, &#34;above & beyond&#34;, to make the customer happy.

I have purchased long cables in the past expecting them to perform in the data and charging areas only to be let down. These cords exceeded my expectations!  I had excellent data transfer every time! The charging capabilities were fantastic too. I used them with high speed chargers and regular charges and got high quality results with each! I love the length of these cords. I don't feel tethered to the computer or the charger, like I do with the original cord. The Friendly Swede logo stamped on them is a nice touch too.

These are a lot thicker in construction then their previous cables.The cables don't crimp, which is a plus. The 30 pin connector is bulky and doesn't work with some cases. The 30 pin connector is where these cables fail. On an ipad 2, iPhone 4S, ipod 2, 3 and 4, these cables do not &#34;click&#34; into the device. I know that you may be thinking that well apple doesn't have the side buttons to release the cable. I am talking about the cable itself not securing itself to the device that if you adjust your device while charging you will hear that sound that it's no longer charging.My cable ends are not worn. Its weird how their older model connected better, but had durability issues whereas this cable is the thickest you would ever find but just doesn't connect well to devices.I have not contacted them regarding this specific cable set but in the past the company has been extremely easy to deal with.

I could do my emails, read texts, and play music at the same time. I could GO ON THE WEB and stay in a phone convo at the same time. Just was amazing and the phone didn't limit what I did.The first issue I encountered was the battery. It barely lasted 8 hours, and that's with background syncing and all that stuff backlight all that turned down. You'd be lucky to get 1 hour at best if all that was on. I got the extended battery, and when it helped, it somehow made my screen go nuts. No joke, put the old one in and the device screen works and never an issue. The extended battery, it scrolls, clicks n things, and the landscape mode didn't work. Motorola tech support recommended a full reset, so I had to set up everything once more.The next issue I had was the music player integration. I can BLUETOOTH myself MP3 songs that AUTOMATICALLY are stored to the 8GB factory included SD card (finally), but they do not have any sort of identification. It says the track name- but with the track number, they are only in numeric order for example 01-&#34;Only Time&#34; The album names for everything that is Bluetoothed over is Bluetooth. It doesn't drag over the album name, and the artist simply reads unknown. I tried the USB with the same result, so i guess it's not all the bluetooth.And while the ANDROID 2.1.1 Android operating system is a joy to use, you cannot save APPS to your SD card. This leads to small lagginess, such as Angry Birds, takes literally 2 minutes to fling the next bird. As far as I was told, processor speed has nothing do with this, and as this was a premium phone, I'd think it had a good processor in it.Overall:It wows, but it could be better. Do I recommend it, yes, somewhat, if it can have it's issues fixed. I guess if you don't mind the SD issue it'd be a perfect phone, but unfortunately I decided it was something I didn't want to use and upgraded.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003DQD5CS" id="B003DQD5CS-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-28:</strong> The Good: Excellent design, lots of power, superb features from Google, amazing cameraThe Bad: App store is still young, processes running in the background kills battery life, keyboard is a bit cumbersomeGoogle as been known for revolutionizing the internet and now they are with their Android phones. The Motorola DROID (A855) is the newest and most advanced phone on the market right now, and this bad boy does an awful lot. A lot of people are going to compare this phone to the iPhone, but the DROID trumps the iPhone in features, and freedom. I will discuss, first, the tech specs and compare them to the iPhone head-to-head so you can see how powerful the DROID truly is.Techno BabbleThe DROID has a 550 MHz processor, and to be specific the Arm Cortex A8 processor that is also present in the iPhone 3GS by Samsung. The 3GS is clocked only 50 MHz higher and can be overclocked to 800 MHz. To compare that the original Xbox has a 733 MHz processor. So can the DROID be overclocked to this as well? Most likely. With a monster processor the DROID can multitask and has one of the first actual mobile OS (besides Windows Mobile 7). This also means maintaining processes running in the background to gain battery life, uninstalling apps (not just deleting them), and a lot more, but we'll get to that later. The iPhone however can not multitask due to the OS running on it, and the processor is only used in games.When it comes to graphics the DROID still hasn't been pushed to its limits. There are very few 3D games on the Android market, but as of right now the iPhone stomps the DROID in the graphics department. The DROID has a 200 MHZz PowerVR SGX 530 GPU. The iPhone has the same, but due to the slightly better CPU is can currently outperform the DROID. The iPhone has been on the market for quite some time, so there are bigger better games available. The DROID should start getting the same quality soon. They both have 256MB of RAM, so under the hood they are pretty much the same.The DROID has a slightly bigger screen sizing in at 3.7' and the iPhone at 3.5'. Does 2 millimeters matter? Yes it does. There is a good 2 millimeters on the top of the iPhone that could be screen, but for some unknown reason it's not. The DROID has a higher resolution of 854480 and 265 ppi (pixels per inch). The 3GS has a 320480 resolution with only 163 ppi so the DROID has double the resolution of the iPhone. That is great for people wanting to watch high-res movies on their device.Both devices have the same input such as the 3 axis accelerometer (tilt sensor), digital compass, Multi-touch display, proximity and ambient light sensors etc. The DROID is a bit heavier than the 3GS, but only by 1.2 oz. The DROID wipes the floor with the 3GS' camera. The DROID camera is 5MP compared to the 3GS 3MP. The DROID has dual LED flash, and geotagging and it can even run higher than 30 FPS. The 3GS has all this except the dual LED flash and this is a huge plus.When it comes to storage the DROID wins with its external memory option. You can insert up to a 32GB micro-SD card, but you're stuck with the 3GS' internal memory and have to pay a huge price for more. The DROID even comes with a 16GB micro- card when you buy the phone. So when it comes to comparing junk under the hood they both have the same hardware, but the DROID has the extra tidbits that push it over the edge.GUI: Graphical User InterfaceThe DROID has an excellent GUI and the whole marketplace is run by the community. There are programs such as PandaHome, OpenHome, GDEHome etc that allow you to change "themes" for a small price or for free. These also change icons, clock widgets etc. The DROID has a great interface that is more like a computer that gives you a desktop, then a slide up menu where all your apps are stored. You can drag and drop as you see fit. The iPhone, however, is plagued with the mundane Apple OS that only show apps in a grid format with a black background. Sure you can change your "wallpaper" but this is only when the phone comes out of sleep mode so it's rarely seen. This makes every iPhone look the same so the DROID wins in customization by a long shot. There are four touch buttons located at the bottom of the screen which are your back button, menu, home, and search. You will use these buttons a lot so Motorola and Google were smart to put these here.Apps: Who's Better?It all comes down to the apps. Who has more right? Well the iTunes marketplace has hundreds of thousands of apps that the DROID doesn't have so the iPhone wins there. However, the Android market is ever-growing, and thanks to the user run community a lot of great apps are showing up that the iPhone can't run. These include a lot of customization apps and loads more. Apps are easier to run on the DROID since there is no iTunes type program. The app store is run off the phone, downloaded from the phone as well. If you don't want an app anymore you go to your settings and uninstall it. Google also allows you to refund anything you buy within 24 hours and Apple does not support this. While iTunes may have more stuff, Android has better customer service and a better community and setup. There are really no "hardcore" games for the DROID like there is for the iPhone, but it's getting there. You do not want to get a DROID for a gaming system just yet for sure; stick with your iPod/phone.Features: Welcome to Google TownThe DROID has a lot of little things going on in it. You can do everything a touch screen phone can do, but it also has a slide out QWERTY keyboard. The buttons were a little flat and the top row is hard to get at if you have big fingers, but it works well. If you tilt the phone sideways you can type with a landscape keyboard or use Google text-to-speech. I found this feature extremely useful when typing long messages or writing reviews for apps. Since this is a Google phone you get all their awesome apps such as Google Earth (yes it's in 3D and you can see every detail), and Google maps. Switch to your "car app" and press navigation. Speak your selection (i.e. Phoenix, Arizona) and Google will give you directions for a car, bus, or walking (God forbid you walk that far!). Press get navigate and the phone will speak you the directions. It doesn't update in real-time, but it does update as you drive down each block.Google Sky is a fun app that lets you point your phone in the sky and it will show you, in real-time, where each constellation and planet is. You get plenty of excellent Google apps such as Gmail, YouTube (yeah Google owns YouTube), and Google Goggles which allows you to take pictures of products or objects and the phone will scan it and search it for you. There's even a Google search bar on the desktop with a text-to-speech button next to it. Brilliant. There are plenty of other apps such as the Amazon store, eBay, Bank of America, MLIA, FML, and even ShopSaavy. This app allows you to scan a barcode and it will tell you where you can find it cheaper online or locally. Of course you have all your social networking apps like Twitter, Facebook, and MySpace which run great.When it comes to things like ringtones, pictures, and videos, so the DROID delivers. You can store any MP3, or picture and set them as wallpapers, notifications, or just ringtones. Mount your SD card via USB and just create the folders. No having to sync with a program on the PC. Total freedom is what Google gives you and this is what I love.Problems: It's Not PerfectThere are some issues with the DROID, but not many and they are minor. The biggest one is the running processes in the background that can kill your battery even in sleep mode. You have to get the Advanced App Killer app and every so often check everything you don't want running and kill the apps. Another problem I ran into was that since most of the apps are user made they can be glitchy and screw up your phone so watch out and read reviews before downloading anything. You could say that the major issue is the app store. There is a lot of apps, but some of it is junk. There aren't any excellent games available, and the app store doesn't have any sort feature except Top Paid, Top Free, and Just In.For a $550 phone (if you pay for it without  a plan) the DROID delivers and trumps the iPhone in every direction except the apps. The DROID is a very advanced phone, and is for people who love using their phones constantly and make it a part of their every day life. With a sleek design, excellent features, sturdy hardware, and monster processing power the DROID should be the #1 phone in 2010.Update: 10/15/2011Now after I have had this phone for 18 months I don't like it as much. The phone started having issues with serious lag, slowdown, and just hardly responds anymore. The touch screen lost sensitivity after about a year, plus the hardware is ancient compared to what is out now. Due to that all the apps are now optimized for higher end phones so the Droid is left in the dust.Overall the phone just doesn't really work anymore internally. It won't come out of sleep mode some times, won't answer calls, turns off randomly, and the internet is just impossible to surf due to the now weak processor. Hardware wise it has stood the test of time with many drops, slides, fumbles, and kicks. Not a single crack or anything, but thankfully this phone is now discontinued. If you have the original Droid you are probably finding the same problems even after a factory reset. The phone was great 22 months ago, but now I just absolutely hate this thing. If I were to amend my score I would give it a 4/10 now, but of course that's unfair and should be remembered for how great it was at the time of release. Did I also mention that the appraisal price for the phone is about $20 now-a-days?</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003DQD5CS" id="B003DQD5CS-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-23:</strong> I bought this to replace my current phone because it was damaged.

Oh that's right! They don't make a case for the HTC Thunderbolt fitted with an extended battery, and for under $40? With the belt clip? Nope! Not happening.This case seems like it would protect my Thunderbolt from just about anything aside from being ran over lol! I thought this would be just what I needed to protect a phone that I have to spend a year+ with, and I can imagine nothing worse than breaking it half way through my contract and having to keep paying the bill or buy one at full price. I work in a corrosive environment, so I figured this would offer the best protection while at work, and on my off days I can peel the rubber off, and use the inner case for regular day to day protection from the dings and scratches that may occur when I slip it in my pocket. The package included a screen protector which I have to admit I have not used yet, since I already had one on my phone. Only thing "negative" about this case it that it does make the phone feel much bigger, but it's understandable considering how thick the rubber around the phone is. Over all I'm happy with this purchase, and if your looking for something that may save your phone from a drop, this may do it... but as a disclaimer I have not been daring enough to try it lol</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00526TWE2" id="B00526TWE2-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-18:</strong> Got it and was well made, but not what I had envisioned.

It provides excellent overall protection in a combination of layers. Comes with a belt clip & screen protector also. The flip-out covers over the camera lens & charging port offer even more protection especially against foul weather when using outdoors. It covers the phone's built-in kickstand but the one built into the case is fine, again following the theme of complete protection of the phone (the impact on having all this coverage over the speaker is negligable). My only minor complaint is how the rubberized portion of the case picks up lint & dust from my pockets. High quality construction, well thought-out protection & perfect fit make this a winner!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00526TWE2" id="B00526TWE2-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-07-06:</strong> Charging the phone with the outside shell is very difficult.

Everyone either has an Android or Apple device, and many times we aren&#8217;t within range of an outlet to charge our device. Fortunately RAVPower has made the RAVPower Luster 6000mAh External Battery to suit the common person whom requires a little extra charge for their smart device.Inside the packaging is the Luster External Batter, a micro USB charger, a carrying bag, and an instruction manual. RAVPower has not only made a compact power bank but an aesthetically pleasing one that comes in four colors: Black, Blue, Gold, or Pink. I chose Black, as it is what I prefer most of my electronics to be.The coiled micro USB charger can be stretched to 24 inches, but I could only personally stretch it to 20.5 inches before the coiled wire became resistant to stretching. It is great that this only includes one connector, unlike the larger versionRAVPower Deluxe External Battery Charger 14000mAh. The larger version includes several unneeded connectors, which are prone to losing. Because this version has no connectors, the chance of an important connector isn&#8217;t as great. I wish they would also include an AC charger, but I understand they did this to cut costs.This also includes a cloth mesh bag, which not many power banks include. This is great, as it keeps the power bank and all of its contents from being lost or damaged. It is a feature that all RAVPower &#8220;Deluxe&#8221; brand power banks possess, which adds sophistication that I personally love.The power bank itself is very small (3.9 x 0.8 x 1.6 inches) and is very light (4.3 ounces). It can easily fit any pocket, purse, or back pack without irritating the user. It has a mat black (in my case) finish, with a silver button, a ring of silver at the top, and gray faces for the front and back. The front has the RAVPower logo, a button to activate the power bank (quickpress) or flashlight (3 second press), and under the silver ring is a place for up to 4 blue LED indicators to light up (Listed below).4 Lights On = 75-100%3 Lights On = 50-75%2 Lights On = 25-50%1 Light On = &#60;25%I have seen the indicators blink, and can safely assume 4 solid lights on is fully charged. These LED indicators are somewhat difficult to see in light, as they are under the silver coated plastic. On the top is one 5V 2.1A USB port, one flashlight, and one micro USB port to charge the device. I like that this uses a micro USB cable to charge the device, instead of proprietary charging, as most Android devices require to be charged by micro USB.  On the bottom are the specs for this power bank:RAVPowerSeries/Model: Luster/ RP-PB17Capacity: 6000mAhInput: 5V/1.5A (Max)Output: 5V/2.1A (Max)Made in ChinaI then tested this using Kindle Fire 1st generation, running stock Kindle Fire&#8217;s modified android OS, with a 44000mAh battery. I tested this with my tablet idling, running no applications or processes. My results are below:7:34pm 7%9:00pm 61%10:00pm 97%In 2.5 hours, my Kindle went from 308mAh to 4268mAh, or 3960mAh total, averaging 1584mAh. These are amazing results for such a small charger in such a short time.3960mAh / 6000mAh = 66% efficientThe total efficiency is around 66% efficient, which is great for an external battery. This is as expected from a company like RAVPower.Overall, I recommend this power bank to any individual needing a compact power bank to charge their device, and is why I give this product 5 out of 5 stars.Pros:+ Compact and light; Can easily fit in any pocket, purse, or back pack without irritating the user.+ Aesthetically pleasing power bank that comes in four color colors (Black, Blue, Gold, or Pink).+ Multifunctional button to either activate power bank or flashlight.+ Uses micro USB instead of proprietary wires. Most android devices require micro USB charging.+ Includes one coiled micro USB wire. Does not include unneeded connectors, such as the larger versionRAVPower Deluxe External Battery Charger 14000mAh.+ Includes cloth mesh bag to keep the power bank and all of its contents from being lost or damaged.Cons:- LED Indicators are somewhat difficult to see, due to silver coated plastic.- Does not include AC charger.I was provided a sample in exchange for an honest and thorough review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007HUTXV8" id="B007HUTXV8-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-01:</strong> This battery pack has enough energy to power any mobile device through the day.Having a 6000mAh battery places this battery pack in the middle of the road.

The flashlight is powerful enough to assist in finding your car keys or other small task.Just plug your phone into the charging port and press the silver power button, then watch you power bar fill up. There are four blue LED power lights hidden underneath the chrome collar that show the battery life. This battery will do the job to charge whatever you throw at it, and does it well.CONTENTS:RAVPower Luster 6000mAh Battery PackMicro USB CordMesh Carrying BagFEATURES:Battery Capacity: 6000mAhBattery Type: Li-ionInput: DC 5V/1.5AOutput: DC 5V/2.1ALife Cycles: 500+Charging Time: 5 HoursDimensions: 3.9 x 0.8 x 1.6in (99.1 x 2.0 x 40.6mm)Weight: 4.3oz (121.9g)Warranty: 1 YearPOWER LEVEL INDICATOR:4 Lights: 75-100%3 Lights: 50-75%2 Lights: 25-50%1 Light:  0-25%I was supplied a free sample for the purpose of review and evaluation, and promised an unbiased review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007HUTXV8" id="B007HUTXV8-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-01:</strong> I love this and I love that it came with so many connectors.

It measures less than 3 3/4" x 1 3/4" x 7/8" and weighs about 5 oz. but can fully recharge most cell phones two or three times and my iPod Shuffle at least five times.  It will also recharge a Kindle or even an electric shaver, really any small electronic device that one of the seven included tips will fit OR which has its own charging cable that fits a USB port.Remember to take the right connecting tips or cables and to push the power button once to start charging a device.  It will stop charging automatically when the receiving battery is fully charged or thirty seconds after it's disconnected.I charge the RAVPower Dynamo-on-the-Go with a USB wall converter but it can also charge through a laptop USB port.  There's a four-stage LED capacity display initiated by pressing the power button.In addition to the seven adapter tips, two cables are included, one 7" long and one 28" long, plus a thick velveteen pouch that is intended to hold the power bank although I use it to store the extra tips and cable.  The Dynamo very sturdy and I have dropped it on the hardwood floor without damage.The LED flashlight is a nice bonus--perfect for finding keys in a purse or to use in an unfamiliar hotel room in the middle of the night without having to turn on a light.The Dynamo-on-the-Go is a necessity for traveling and to keep in the glove compartment but it's also handy to have on hand when you forget to charge your cell phone or MP3 player overnight and need to charge it on-the-run.  It's nice not to have to worry so much about having a full charge and I highly recommend these for peace of mind as well as convenience.A sample was provided for unbiased review.EDIT:  I used this as both a flashlight and to recharge my little MP3/radio to get the news for a week while the power was out after the hurricane a few weeks ago.  This proved so very useful to have on hand.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007HUTXV8" id="B007HUTXV8-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-31:</strong> great product. I was debating between a bigger battery (& a separate plastic back cover, and a separate phone cover) for my Galaxy S3, or, buy this one. Bought this one, as I don't need to use it everyday,  so my phone can stay slim and very pocketable. And keep the RAVpower in my bag for emergency use.The two cables supplied with the RAVPower are pretty good, and I use them both for different charging locations (e.g. hanging off of the monitor's USB port for charging phone while on desk).I would like to see the unit charge my phone faster if possible. For my use case, if I could connect the unit to my phone for 1-hour, I would like to get a 60-70% charge on the phone if possible. that would go a long way.Good quality product, small and sleek.cheers</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007HUTXV8" id="B007HUTXV8-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-29:</strong> Great product, does what it says.

It will recharge an iPod 3 to 4 times from a dead state and the same with my cell phone. It will not, however, fully recharge an iPad from a dead state but its still a respectable charge. Includes a flashlight that requires the on button to be pressed for for about 3 seconds which pretty much eliminates accidentally turning the light on and running the charger down. The pack takes a while to charge but slower charges usually mean that the internal batteries will have longer lives. As with all battery packs, it's good to occasionally fully discharge them, then give them a full, uninterrupted charge. Excellent value, respectable capacity, compact size.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007HUTXV8" id="B007HUTXV8-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-08:</strong> it stop working after 9 months!!!! not happy</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007HUTXV8" id="B007HUTXV8-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-05:</strong> Perfect to carry it as additional power supply when travelling.

I chose this one based on the excellent reviews and was startled (happily) to see how inexpensive this gorgeous-looking cover was. Now that I have received it, I can say it is well-done! High quality, a nice trendy color (I got the blue) that I can't possibly misplace (ok, I probably still can) and looks like it cost a lot more than it did.Most importantly, I can now leave the safety of the couch with it, without fear that I'm going to destroy my new N7. I love the on-off magnet, but have noticed it doesn't work ALL the time when closing it. Sometimes it stays on after I close the cover if I'm not careful about how I do it. I leave my screen on for 2 minutes rather than the default, so battery can be a slight concern if you have your display set to stay on longer. Slight. Not enough for me to deduct a star, and this thing turns right on the second I open the cover and that's really the magic for me. The rotating thingamajig works great, and I was able to rotate and prop my N7 and read an entire book yesterday without hand cramps, which is another big plus for me. The tab holding the N7 in place doesn't bother me at all, and while the N7 can shift around a tiny bit, it's not a concern to me as the slippage does not interfere with my viewing of the screen, the camera or any of the access points.My only issue at all is the placement of the power button on the N7 itself, slightly to the back of the machine, which makes finding it by feel while in a case a bit obnoxious for the clumsy people. I don't think a case could accommodate that design "feature" without leaving it susceptible to scrapes and damage to the unit, so no stars off for that either.Overall, I wasn't expecting it to be as beautiful and functional as it is, due to the really affordable price, and I'm thrilled with it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008N0OK00" id="B008N0OK00-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-19:</strong> So I had this product for about three months now. I bought it due to its design, color, protection and sleep mode.Sleep mode/Cover: The magnet was very faint inside the cover, and it hardly closed to begin with. Now it is completely gone and no longer goes into sleep mode. Cover doesn't shut closed.Stand: It doesn't stand up on itself what so ever. Don't expect it to seriously. If someone could figure out how, let me know, it cannot hold on its own.Material: Very soft and sleek leather material that has cushion.Color: Very light teal aqua color, very pretty. As pictured.Holding it: Its awkward to actually hold and use. Its hard to use the upper screen buttons as well as the lower ones. Finding the side buttons are even harder.Overall this case is just on my nexus collecting dust.

I am not sure the cover is really leather, seems synthetic to me, though a good synthetic.  Stitching was all very good.  Fit the device pretty well though not perfect.  It can slide a bit sideways at times.  A minor issue though short of perfect.  I like the color of it.  Not garish, but easily picked out when you have set the tablet down and are looking for it.The ability to prop it up in landscape or portrait orientation is very nice.  Especially so for reading or viewing video.  Cover seems sturdy enough to offer pretty good protection and is simple to use.  I have received compliments on the appearance.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008N0OK00" id="B008N0OK00-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-04:</strong> This is the second case I've purchased by Devicewear, and unfortunately it was as underwhelming as the first. The construction overall just feels cheap and the frame around the screen overlaps too much. There is already a tear in the leather at the bottom and I have a feeling that it won't protect the Nexus much if it fell. I was expecting a lot due to the rave reviews but I guess I didn't have as good of an experience. I'm going to stick with my Blurex case, which is the sturdiest Nexus case I've ever used.Also, the grooves are not wide enough for the case to sit firmly when placed in a Portrait angle. I'm not sure why they're so thin, it makes the stand feel flimsy. For a case that's pricier than most other Nexus cases, I was expecting better quality.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008N0OK00" id="B008N0OK00-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-10:</strong> All over a good cover for your nexus 7. If you are looking for something sturdy, for standing it on it's side (video viewing), this is not the product for you. The cover is weak when you fold it in a viewing angle, and without something to lean it on, the tablet will 90% topple over.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008N0OK00" id="B008N0OK00-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-10:</strong> For $20 I have no significant complaints. I'm somewhat disappointed with the low angle and somewhat flimsy support in portrait mode. It would also be nice if the tab that holds the device in the case had velcro to lock it in position. Otherwise, it fits very well, offers good protection, and the magnetic enclosure works well: it keeps the case solidly closed and there are no issues with the magnet turning of the device when folded back for handheld use (I see those complaints in the reviews of most other cases).So I recommend the case with some reservation. If they added velcro to the retaining tab and offered a steeper landscape angle with better support then I'd give it 5 stars. Aside from that it's a well made case with decent functionality.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B008N0OK00', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B008N0OK00', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B005AV6CI8</h2>    <p class="price"> $B005AV6CI8</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

An insult to any homo sapiens with average vision. This thing not only looks fake, but it's absolutely useless due to the following reasons: the camera lens is made of a cheap plastic and scratches super easy, the item comes with a white, non transparent, sticky protective cover on top of it, which leaves gunk on the lens cover. You cannot clean that glue with alcohol or goo gone, I am not sure what the adhesive is. Takes a lot of work. The lens cover is not recessed like the OEM design, it's actually sticking out, so when you put your phone on the table, the lens are the first ones to get the hit. Incredibly stupid. The color is way off, and the metallic type at the bottom does not look like the OEM part at all. It's bad, poor quality, pathetic excuse for an iPhone back.So that's the product I got from ShopCellParts.

This package also comes with several 'sticky tabs' for re-sticking the bottom piece if one ever decides to remove it, and later decide to use the clip again. The reason I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 is because the top piece sometimes slides around. It doesn't slide a lot, but it once in a while I can see that it had moved. One thing I would mention is that the phone will no longer lie completely flat if the front cover was folded open and tucked to the back. I used to like to take notes like this, but now I have to leave the cover open on the table instead of tucking it behind the phone. I wish Samsung had made a built-in magnet, but they did not so I deem this product as an adequate replacement of what should-have-been.

While I can and have removed it and they do provide some extra sticky strips, it's not for easy removal and reattachment, but for replacement if it should come off.I'd give it 5 stars if it attached to to the S-Cover only, and while that seems like a less permanent or sturdy implementation, it's certainly the most flexible.If you plan to use the S-Cover only then this will do what it is expected to do without issue.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GXO6UHE" id="B00GXO6UHE-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-06:</strong> It does exactly what it's made for.

The double sided tape provided is very small and hard to apply so you end up using at least 2 or 3 of the 5 provided the first time. The magnets are actually meant to be taped onto the device which leaves residue afterwards. If you do take of the magnet part that sticks to your phone, the bottom piece falls so you would need glue to piece the magnet back together which is disappointing. The directions are very vague and hard to understand, even with the pictures.

The metal clip goes on both sides of the cover, so you actually have metal touching and possibly scratching your screen when it's closed, who designed this?  You have to adhere the magnet directly onto your phone, which can scrape right off if you take it in and out of your pocket.  Oh and the clip has sharp edges and can ruin your flip clover while putting it on if you're not very careful.

My update to 5 stars is on the customer response and excellent customer service. Thank you, Spigen.My original review: Clipped the non-magnet piece to my Galaxy Note 3 case. No problem. The magnet is a slim magnet inside another metal piece. The magnet fell out of that piece. Not sure what was keeping it inside except perhaps some sticky film.  I could not get it back together.However, there was very minimal magnet attraction through the piece it was inside of.  I noticed the magnet stuck fairly well by itself so I stuck it to the back flap of the case and hoping it stays (I may have to super glue it).  All in all, I cannot recommend this item due to material and the fact that the magnet is quite weak.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GXO6UHE" id="B00GXO6UHE-review40" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-16:</strong> I purchased this clip to go along with the Note 3 S-View Cover which I purchased for my pops.

It is hard to get too excited about a charger because, well....it's a charger.  This is nicely made though.  The body is solid and the 30 pin connector locks in nicely to the iPad.  I've had some cheaper adapters which connect but fall off easily.  Not so on the Xmit.Like many modern adapters this product has a head which plugs into the wall, along with a USB port so you can attach the included USB to 30 pin cable.  You can, of course, substitute a different cable to charge a device with a different adapter, such as a Lightning.  Of course, always check your specs to make sure you use the an adapter with the right power levels for your device.The cable itself is very nice.  Decent gauge cable, and, at 4 feet long, better than Apple's skimpy cables.There is also a little bump on the 30 pin end so you know which end is up.The available colors are a nice feature to me, so you have something a little distinguishable from everyone else's white, or sometimes black, cable and charger.I really like the cable and charger.

My iPhone is still going strong, so I wanted to simply replace my cable and charging block, rather than getting an entirely different phone.In the package, you'll find a charging block and a 30-pin cable. The two things I really like about the cable are that it's extremely sturdy and it's 4 feet long.Overall, after a month of use, I'm still very satisfied with my Belkin MIXIT Home Charger and cable. My rating is 5 out of 5 stars.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00IPDRRXC', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00IPDRRXC', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B0071FOMA6</h2>    <p class="price"> $B0071FOMA6</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

However it wasn't as sturdy as he thought - he dropped his phone and it ended up not protecting it very well (didn't drop it face down) so I'm weary about the true protection it gives. Another friend has the same phone, with an Otterbox case and has dropped it several times, never damaging it like the phone in the Trident case.

These protectors would also be good for use on an iPhone if the thickness of an Otter case will not fit into your method of carry.  They are a little difficult to line up properly before attaching them to the glass but it can be done.  One must be careful to avoid trapping air pockets under the protective sheets while installing them and also make sure the glass surface is completely free of any small dust particles as these will form an air gap bubble under the sheets.  The little lint cleaning cloths that come with them are nearly worth the purchase price.  The lint cloths can be used even after you receive whatever kind of protective case you are going to employ and will not scratch the surface glass of the iPhone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003RZTCWC" id="B003RZTCWC-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-23:</strong> The product is as pictured and as described.

The price is certainly good, to the point where I'm not even sure how they can get them to my door for the amount of money paid, much less manufacture and package them. I'm pretty sure these are drop-shipped direct from China, because mine took about four weeks to arrive. (And speaking of dropping, I dropped my phone twice in that span - you might want to order ahead if you know you're going to be getting an iPhone and decide to purchase these covers. But, keep reading.) The instructions for application were cryptic at best, but once I figured out how to remove the plastic sheets from the cover on both sides, I was okay. The lint-free cloth provided, however, did not do a very good job. I screwed up my first cover by pulling off the plastic too soon. The second one had too many dust particles and a bunch of bubbles. The third one was serviceable, but it wasn't completely sticky at the bottom. After about two months, the non-adhesion area grew to about one-third of the surface of the phone. I pulled it off and went withBelkin Clear Screen Protector for Apple iPhone 4S (3 Pack). If you get lucky and get a sticky cover and get the dust off your phone, these will probably work. Still, you'll have to get lucky, so I would say if you're a gambler and don't mind waiting a month for your product to arrive, these are fine or at least, give good cost performance. Otherwise, try the Belkin or something else.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003RZTCWC" id="B003RZTCWC-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-01-26:</strong> For the price and s/h free I have no complaint! The tricky part is this film has 3 skins in one, you have to be a bit tactful to peel off till the last skin. In order to do a good job, I choose a dust free environment (not bedroom cos the flying dust will stick on the adhesive skin). I wipe off my iphone 4 with alcohol and eye-glasses cleaning cloth, once I peel off the skin I place it on my iphone immediately. It comes with 2 small labels to avoid leaving finger prints. Pretty effective. The size fits on my iphone well.

Based on mainly positive reviews and prime shipping, I ordered these. I got them in one buisness day. The package was exactly as described with three screen protectors inside and one lint cleaning cloth.Directions were clearly printed on the back of the package...although it is simple enough to figure out on your own. There are two different tabs to pull to adhere the screen protector to the surface. Each one is numbered so there is no confusion. It is clear as it says, which is just what I wanted. It did not effect the brightness or colors of my screen in any way.I was able to install it without any bubbles except for two tiny little ones that don't bother me at all. The plastic is thick enough to feel durable, yet still responsive. The cutout at the top is wide enough for both the camera and the speaker. Overall, I HIGHLY RECOMMNED this product.

So I bought 3 packs and figure I'll have plenty of spares.The Amazon version does fit the 4s pretty perfectly, all the way to the edge with proper cutouts that are lines up.  My complaint is pretty much like with all screen protectors.  My phone is brand new, out of the box.  I pulled off the factory screen protector and wiped it clean.  There was nothing on the screen.  The act of pulling the protector off this screen saver created trash/glue clumps underneath.  I was able to wash some of it off and still put the protector on.  So while I want to give it lower stars for that, this is sort of par for the course with these things.  I got it on the phone but there is still trash under it that was not on phone to begin with.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003RZTCWC" id="B003RZTCWC-review49" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-10:</strong> The screen savers are a phone saver, it is so easy to mess up your phone and for the price these screen savers work great.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003RZTCWC" id="B003RZTCWC-review50" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-28:</strong> These fit my iPhone 4 perfectly.

Unlike other water resistant cases this one adds the minimum amount of bulk to the overall size of the phone. I was initially concerned about how the finger print recognition would perform with the case on the phone. However, I can report that there is no difference in how it works. Purchasers should take care to thoroughly clean all surfaces of the phone prior to putting it into the case as this can have a detrimental effect on performance. Pay particular attention to the display, the home button, the camera lens, and flash. Anything left on these surfaces will effect performance. The only negative comment concerns the screen protector that comes with the case. It is not the anti-glare variety and this is quite annoying. The manufacturer should offer a choice of an anti-glare screen protector as you cannot leave any other screen protector on the phone and use their case. However, the this is the only negative I have found.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D7M8ALE" id="B00D7M8ALE-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-28:</strong> My teenage son has a penchant for damaging his iPhones (yes plural) so we insisted that he house his iPhone 5S in a sturdy, protective case.

I've been concerned about dropping my new iphone 5 and damaging it. I used an ifrogz case for several weeks, but felt I needed even more protection. I know many owners love the sleek look of this newest iphone, but I feel more comfortable handling it in this grippy, well cushioned case. It takes a bit of effort to get all of the parts on, but they fit well. I also love the detachable clip, since I often wear clothing without pockets and don't like to carry a purse just for my phone. This is  ideal if you have small children around who (with or without your permission) handle your phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0099VXLCU" id="B0099VXLCU-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-04:</strong> i have tried a good dozen cases and this is great for the money. the blue color shows up well in the bottom of my briefcase. good protection</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0099VXLCU" id="B0099VXLCU-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-09:</strong> Awesome case!

The case is very durable and easily withstands everyday (and not so everyday) drops and bumps.  The touch screen is very responsive and is an improvement over the iPhone 4 case. It attaches to the outside of the silicone cover. This makes it easy to remove and clean.  The removable clip is more durable and has a better over all design then the previous model.  On the downside, the case does make it hard to hear the speaker.  The silicone cover does a nice job of absorbing shock, but it also tends to stick to your pants pocket when removing it.  Also, aftermarket headphone plugs may not fit into the narrow access port designed in the plastic case.I use my iPhone 5 frequently in rugged situations in the wilderness.  Despite a few shortcomings, this case more than meets my needs.Pros:1. touch screen is very responsive and easy to remove and clean2. case can take a beating3. case is relatively water resistant and keeps out most dirt and dustCons:1. case make the speaker a bit hard to hear2. silicone cover makes it hard to pull out of your pants pocket3. headphone jack requires a narrow shaft on the plug</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0099VXLCU" id="B0099VXLCU-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-16:</strong> this product was junk packaging was old , arrives with tears in it was horrible I would stay away from griffin in the future</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0099VXLCU" id="B0099VXLCU-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-25:</strong> i thought it was a good idea, except a few flaws made me return it. the seals on teh ports make it somewhat water resistant, except the big gaping holes on the screen, which let water get in, mess up the touch ability, which made me need to open it up and clean it. other than that its a typical manly bulky protective case. also good seller cuz it arrived quickly</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0099VXLCU" id="B0099VXLCU-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-18:</strong> I guess by now I phone 5 users are surprised at how fragile the i phone 5 is.

The only thing you might need to know is that you can not use the Apple lightning to 30 pin adapter as the case has hard plastic in the way.

And bought this case as a back up case, just incase (pun). I could not pass it up as I got a super deal here on Amazon.Have not used it because I have one of those LIFEPROOF $100 cases I am using now, that's 100% waterproof. But I did try the Griffin case out and for the average Joe who likes a BELT CLIP case that's rugged it's YOUR case.I'm on a boat all the time, it rains, splashes, etc. So I'll keep using the Lifeproof (way too expensive case) because I have too. But for the average person. The Griffin Survivor is fantastic!MEN, don't do phones in their pockets. WE use belt clips. Especially MEN doing stuff, rather than sitting behind a desk.And it's hard to find cases with this kind of protection with BELT CLIPS. But if you're wet, or gonna get really wet and want a industructable $30 belt clip and a $60+ waterproof case...Go with something like Lifeproof.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0099VXLCU" id="B0099VXLCU-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-20:</strong> I bought the Survivor for my new iPhone 5 because I'm a sailor so my phone gets exposed to rain and spray, and because I have been known to drop things. Although I did not drop test my phone or dunk it in water, examination of the case convinces me it will be good protection.  There were mixed reviews about sound quality -- I can report that sound is fine -  mic, earphone, and speaker phone.  No problem, sounds like without the case. I had no problem using the touchscreen through the case window.  The case is also more comfortable to hold than the bare phone. I like it a lot. This case is, however, a bit bulky: 3/4in thick, 2 7/8 in wide, 5 7/16 in long.  Not huge, but a bit big for me to carry in my pocket or on my belt at work. The belt clip provided is secure, but not easy to use. I bought an incipio case for weekday use, and will use the Griffin on the weekends. It takes about a minute to put the case on.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0099VXLCU" id="B0099VXLCU-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-03:</strong> I hate this case but it's good for what it is... it's just too much for me. if you play football with your phone then it's ok. The flap over the camera is a pain it the butt. It feels poorly made - the rubber flaps have little extra bits on them. The cover gets an 'oil spill' like effect to it on the face cover. It's huge.

Though, I would never put it to the test like Griffin does!The case consists of 4 parts:1. A plastic shell for the bottom and sides of the phone. This has holes for all ports, speaker, etc.2. A thick rubber cover that locks over the plastic shell and provides tight fitting covers for all ports, camera, etc. This covers the bottom, sides, and provides a raised ridge of rubber above the screen.3. A plasic screen cover that locks securely onto the rubber shell. This does include a screen protector.4. A clip on rotating belt clip. The clip pops open and locks in a position to provide a stable "landscape" stand to watch videos, etc. The belt clip also locks in the closed position if you wish to keep the jaws from opening and getting caught on your pocket when sliding it in, should you not want to clip it.This case is very substantial, once on the phone you cannot see the clean lines of your iPhone 5 any longer, but you know that the $800+ investment is quite protected from damage and the elements. I wouldn't call it water-proof, but I would say that it protects against small amounts of spillage and major dust.The only con I have found is the plastic screen protector is raised above the screen and it takes a bit to get used to what is needed for touch controls with it on, especially if you are used to using the phone without a cover or a screen protector. But once I got used to it, it hasn't been a problem.So far, no one has complained they can't hear me with this on, and I have had no problems hearing callers when using the phone in regular mode and with the speakerphone.I highly recommend this case to protect the investment in the iPhone 5.  They don't call it the survivor for nothing!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0099VXLCU" id="B0099VXLCU-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-09:</strong> The screen corners weren't able to touch like full use of your iphone =hard to play games and the such, and back cover camera piece broke off the 2nd day.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0099VXLCU" id="B0099VXLCU-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-19:</strong> Five star quality case.Great cost.Huge!Buttons don't always line up. You need to push on the case a little to have them line up. The clip covers the charging hole, so you can't use the clip stand while charging the phone. This case is a lot bigger than my wife's cell phone case! Still have not decided if I like the clip on belt.Easy to take the font face off for cleaning. Unlike same iPad case that we own, the back camera flap swivels down. The iPad case folds and will not hold in place. This is a big positive!

That basically the mic not knowing what to do in louder situations.So, remove the tape, open the camera cover when talking, and you have a perfect case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B0099VXLCU', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B0099VXLCU', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B003V1MP6M</h2>    <p class="price"> $B003V1MP6M</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

I would purchase again.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BY6RH7I" id="B00BY6RH7I-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-28:</strong> I had been looking for cables for my twin grandson's 2nd generation iPads, which have been getting harder to find.

My iPhone 5s fits in the pouch, albeit tightly (maybe because I put it in with the case on).  The pouch that holds the phone has a plastic cover.  This provides some protection from sweat and you can access the phone by touching the plastic cover, but this cover is glossy, which makes it difficult to see the phone.  I run using the Nike Running + app, so I like to see how my run is progressing (so I secure this armband on my forearm).  Technically, I can see the phone screen, but it isn't easy.  Not sure I would recommend this armband nor do I think I would buy it again if given the opportunity.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009XGZGZG" id="B009XGZGZG-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-06:</strong> This does get wet and sweaty but so far, not enough to effect the phone.

I was very pleased with it.  I purchased this unit after updating to iPhone 5.  I'm disappointing in the cheap build quality.  It's basically very thin and flimsy neoprene.It does fit my iPhone and holds it tight, even though I have a thin 'barely there' case on it.  I also have a BodyGuardz screen protector and my second biggest issue with this case is the plastic screen cover will stick to the face of my iPhone.  This makes taking the iPhone out of the arm band very difficult.My biggest issue with this arm band is the plastic 'O' that holds the strap.  You can see it on the last product image, on the right side of the face of the arm band.  There's nothing to secure that ring in place and it rotates when you try to tighten the band.  This forces the band into the smaller top and bottom part of the O ring.  When you tighten the strap around your arm the now smaller strap digs into your arm.  If you manage to keep it in place while you tighten the strap, during your run it will rotate and slightly loosen the strap.  I'm forced to find some way to sew or clip that ring in place so it doesn't rotate.This is a major design flaw and I expected better from Tune Belt.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009XGZGZG" id="B009XGZGZG-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-10:</strong> this is just the thing i needed, i woke up early in the morning for a little workout and this is just great, perfect fit, my phone is safe and i listen to my music while running the best.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009XGZGZG" id="B009XGZGZG-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-10:</strong> Bought this and the $9.85Ionic ACTIVE Sport Armband Case for New Apple iPhone 5 5th Generation 5G (AT&T;, T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon)armband.  Comparing them side by side and on...I was surprised the cheaper, more comfortable ones was the Ionic.  Also, it seems the ionic will hold the phone in better..has a flap..this one is just a hole and seems to slip out even with my sticky gel case.  My iPhone 5 with a gel case on fits perfectly into both of these.  No struggles.  Glad I don't have to remove my case!  We'll see which one last longer.  Alternating between my runs. I will adjust the reviews accordingly. Not a big deal but Tune belt came in VERY generic packing.  Maybe i got a fake from Amazon?Well stitching came out around the band not where the phone is after just 1 run.  Going back already.

The headphone port has an access hole in the bottom of the case so you can easily plug your headphones in, and there is a small velcro flap on the side that allows you to coil your unused headphone cable around it so it isn't dangling everywhere while you are exercising.The armband itself fits me fine, but I can see where some other people might need the optional extension if you have super muscular arms. For me (average guy), it is close to the limit on how large the opening can go but still fits fine and stays tight.I have a slim case on my phone that adds a small amount of size to the phone, and it still fits in this armband without having to remove the phone from the case, which is exactly what I was looking for. I can slide my phone, case and all, into the armband, work out, and then quickly remove the phone and case and put it back in my pocket when I'm done.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009XGZGZG" id="B009XGZGZG-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-11:</strong> This is a top quality case for your phone.

Since purchase I've run approx  210 miles. Held up well, but now the stitching is starting to release, and the Velcro is wearing out / down. So it's not sticking as well, the stiching on the rectangular clip that you thread the arm band through as well is starting to release. I like the product but I don't know if I'd spend the money again, I think I'd look for a cheaper option :).The plastic face doesn't seem to interfere with me at all.

This product places your phone virtually flush against the vent so in my case, I could only orient the phone vertically and as I went over bumps in the road, the phone shook and bounced eventually falling out of the a/c vent, mount and all, onto the floor of my car. For this amount of money it should be a lot more reliable and not shake and rattle as you drive. It is also a bit more difficult to both insert your phone into the car mount and remove it when you exit the vehicle, a definite two handed operation. I must say that although it looks great, is small and seems really techie I was very disappointed with it's real world performance. If you rent cars on a regular basis and want a car mount that you can take with you when you travel, then this small product may be what you are looking for as it is relatively tiny, has almost no weight and can be used for brief periods of time to hold your phone. Just remember that the phone/mount combination will fall out of the a/c vent onto the floor so don't place any hard objects on the floor that might damage you phone when it drops. Great concept, needs improvement.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D901B4W" id="B00D901B4W-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-30:</strong> I got this so I could mount my Nexus 5 in my car.

Nav worked great, but the device would heat up so periodically I had to hold the device over the A/C vents.  Upon returning home, decided to look for a car mount that would keep the device in front of the vents for constant cooling.You'd be surprised how many clunky and ugly mounts are out there, but this one is simple and elegant and works perfectly.  Since it is universal, any of our family's devices can be placed in this mount securely.  The 4 prongs on the back can be turned 90 degrees so you can choose which way to mount it (tighter grip or more loose grip on the vents) plus the minimalistic design makes it possible to plug your device into the car charger regardless of where your charging port is located (side, bottom, top of device).

It is designed to fit snugly on air vent blades & does in my car.  Placing it on a blade so the bottom of the phone leans into the dash seems to keep it stable.It is relatively expensive for what it is, but the value is in the design & function.I guess durability over time will be the real test.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D901B4W" id="B00D901B4W-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-04:</strong> I love this product.

So, I went back to trying to make this clip work.  It doesn't play well with my Sony Xperia Z with a case, so I just roll without a case now.  It does makes it easier to clip in and out without using the case, and I've gotten better at it with practice.  I can clip my phone in one handed now that I've gotten used to the action of the springs, you need to push up against the right side of the clip to open it up. Removing is tricky but still doable, and sometimes it does slide around on vents - though I can do it now without it completely falling off the vents.Someone, commented that they had no problem using this case with an LG G2 phone.  My father has that phone so I'm familiar with it.  What makes my phone any many other big android phones different is that the LG G2 has all the buttons on the back, so that means you can clip it right in the middle and you can man handle the phone without worrying about pressing any buttons - as apposed to my phone which has the volume rocker and power button taking up most of the middle of the phone, leaving only a little area in the top or bottom.  I've got to feel for where the buttons are on my phone and clip it in so that it doesn't keep pressing down on the volume, and I've done this enough times now that I've gotten used to it.  However, even though I've gotten better at clipping in my phone it's still wobbles when I drive since I can only clip in from the bottom or top.  I like to keep my phone in landscape, for gps etc, so my phone falls over completely upside down, so I've found a work around for that as well.  I've figured out a vent placement that let's me put the phone in a lopsided landscape mode where one side of the phone rests against a radio nob - it doesn't leave any room for adjustment, and the screen is very crooked but at least it's not flopping around any more.Since I have found a way to make this work, I'm bumping up my original 1 star review to a 3 star. I've had to make comprises to make this car mount work and it's not perfect, but it's ok.Original Review:At first I thought this was an awesome minimalist design.  I even showed it off to friends and recommended it.  However after using it for some time I have changed my opinion and decided it's terrible in practical use.Clip.  The way it attaches to your vehicle is with slide on clips - they are metal clips with rubber boots on them - and you slide it onto your ac vents.  The rubber pieces detached from mine after removing it from the vents only after a few times.  I reattached them with epoxy.  However even still it doesn't hold still.  It's constantly wiggling loose.  You can bend the clips a little bit to get them tighter, but that doesn't help, it still wiggles loose.Clamp.  It clamps onto your phone by a spring loaded side clamps.  The force of the spring is very strong.  It makes sense because it has to really hold onto your phone, but it's really strong.  If you have an iphone your phone is much narrower so it's a little easier, if you have an android phone and one with a bigger screen (like mine at 5") the phone is bigger so you have to really fight with the clamps to open wide enough.  It's is a two handed affair to clip your phone in and out, and it's not fast and easy at that.  It's a struggle each time to pull and grab and at the same time the weak vent clip doesn't hold tight so the whole thing wiggles around and half the time just pops off the ac vent.Clamp length.  This was obviously designed to fit thin square edged phones (ie iphone) and not much else, because it only extends out a short length, plus it has pointy rubber hooks that are supposed to hold the phone edges, but they are too short for larger devices so it ends up only holding your phone in with pointy rubber hooks and not whole side.  If you have a case, it probably won't fit or hold tight.  If you have a phone with a rounded back, it probably won't hold.  If you have a phone with an extended battery pack, it probably won't fit.  I had a phone with an extended battery pack with a rounded back and it would go in, but one bump in the road or a turn and it would pop off and the phone would go flying into the foot well, where I have to hope it doesn't slide under my brake or gas pedal or I don't wreck trying to grab for it. I upgraded to a new phone and it's too big with a case, well it fits just barely with a very minimal case but it's a struggle and it doesn't hold very well.Narrow design.  Because it only holds with two narrow clamps it may be a challenge to find a place to clamp onto your phone securely.  Most android phones have power and volume rockers on the side (and around the middle or at least mine do), so you basically have to clamp onto a bottom or top edge, which makes the phone top or bottom heavy - which relating to the issue of the wobbly vent clamp - it causes the phone to tilt and move around quite a lot while driving.  I have to constantly readjust the angle of the phone and I drive a prius v for goodness sakes so it's not like I'm hot rodding it.So basically I would only consider this if you have an iphone without a case or a very minimalist case.  I'm way past my time to return, so I'm going to stick it in a drawer and move on to the another car mount.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D901B4W" id="B00D901B4W-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-12:</strong> I am still in awe as to how creative, well-designed, and simple this phone holder is.  It's so compact for carrying around if needed and sturdy enough to hold my Galaxy S4 phone w/ TPU case pretty stable on the vent of my '05 Accord Coupe.  My wife's Nexus 5 phone with case also fit just fine.  There was still a little bit more room to stretch so if you have a thicker case for any of these phones (or comparably sized smartphone), there shouldn't be any issues fitting them in this phone holder.I was a bit hesitant to spend $25 when there are other holders for cheaper, but after some use I have absolutely no regrets.  All the other ones on the market are significantly larger and obstructs your windshield view one way or another.  However, Airframe's holder solves both issues.The only only negative is that it obstructs one of your vents so if your car doesn't allow you to close that particular vent, be cautious about heat blowing on the phone.Great product and highly recommended even at the relatively higher price point.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D901B4W" id="B00D901B4W-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-09:</strong> Functions perfectly.

The mount also swivels so you can position your phone how you like.My iPhone shows new messages on the lock screen so I can quickly glance at the phone when it lights up and see them for a bit without taking my hands off the wheel.

So much so, that I consider it DOA for daily commutes.This mount has to be mounted/unmounted with my smartphone four times a day for my drive to and from work.Part of its problem is that when attached to the air vents, the weight of the Kenu Airframe and a modern smartphone pull the air vent downward, as if you wanted air to blow into your lap.But that makes it hard to see and touch the smartphone or an iPod.I have a large smartphone. Its within the spec of what the Kenu holds, but when you add on the smartphone protector, I have to work the Kenu with both hands to get the phone into the mount. And that's after taking off the silicone outer shell of my phone protector first (which has to be found and put back onto the phone at the end of my commute)This dog has fleas. And we haven't even talked about whether or not you want your vehicle's heater or AC blowing directly into your phone for your commutes.Kenu m i g h t be good for a non-smartphone or perhaps for a very small smartphone circa 2011, but the weight of most phones now will make this mount turn downard. And whether your device fits easily into the Kenu or not, mounting and unmouting it 4 times a day defeats its purpose.The Kenu Airframe is like tying your shoes with your eyes closed four times a day. You could do it.

I wish I would have spent the money on this holder from the start.The Airframe is very sturdy and has no issue clipping on to my 2011 Prius vent. The FunTM mount I had purchased suctioned to my windshield which I thought would be the best location, but I was wrong. Once I got the Airframe I realized how much of my view the windshield mounted holders block. This thing is also much more sturdy than the FunTM. This is in part due to the fact that the FunTM mount swivels and the Airframe is stationary, but the Airframe is also a much more solidly built product.One more thing - I like having my phone attached to the vents as the AC keeps the phone cool. I had some heat concerns with my old holder as the dashboard and area under the windshield got really hot in the summer.Bottom line: I love this thing and have ordered another for my wife. Invest the extra $10 in the Airframe from the start and you will be happy.

Due to a glitch in either Apple's IOS or Chryslers U-Connect software our phones don't signal when a text is incoming. The best solution was to place the iPhone in between the speedo and tach in a small indent that holds the info screen. Naturally that blocked the display of information in that area. This not only solves that issue but it's so small that it's not noticeable when not using it. We only worry about the phone stuff when we're going out of state or a distance anyway.Using it in a 2012 Grand Cherokee and tried it in my old 2007 VW Passat. It's been 6 months and still like new.

Our phones are way better technology than the junk in our cars. Either you have the latest, most state of the art navigation and music playing system in your car (in which case in 2 years you will laugh at it) or you don't and your phone is already better.Over the last few years I have realized that I'd much rather prefer to use my phone as a navigation tool (such as the Waze app) or a Music Player (to stream spotify or an audio book). When I do find the instance that I use my car navigation system, I am dismayed that I don't have dynamic routing, traffic reports, updated map data and so on.If you car has bluetooth, then you are pretty much set. All you need is power (an article for a future post) and a mount for your phone. I have been doing some research on phone mounts for our cars, and one that I can take on trips where I am driving a rental car around and using my phone to find my way.My research has ended with what I have found to be a fantastic solution to having visibly of my phone in a hands free configuration... so enter the Kenu Airframe.What is it?The Kenu Airframe [24.95 @ Amazon in Black and White] is a contraption that you attach to your heating/AC vent in your car. It attaches to the plastic fins, and stays secure. Then you attach your phone to it. It has the added benefit that when you have the AC on it cools your phone down, which on a hot day is necessary as the GPS can burn up the battery, heat the phone and prevent it from charging.Why did you get it?I wanted something that was easy to place my phone in for my commute every day, and have the ability to stream music or use Waze to find the best route home in traffic. I was particularly interested in something that did not attach to the dashbaord (possibly ruining the dashboard) or the front windshield (illegal in some states).I also wanted something portable that I could take on a vacation or trip.I ended up buying 3 of them. One for my car, my wife's car and for travel.How has it made your life better?It's really high quality, easy to install and remove, and won't damage the car. It allows me to keep my phone at a convenient arm's length and keep me focused on driving and not looking around for my phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D901B4W" id="B00D901B4W-review32" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-12:</strong> Why hasn't anyone thought of this before?

Seems like the only options are cheapo dash-mounts, or the insane windshield mounts with the long arms.  What I wanted was a small, simple, adjustable cell phone holder that had a good grip and could be placed within view, for whatever car I was driving.  OK, now that I look at what I just read, that's a long list of requirements.  The key feature for me was the &#34;adjustable&#34; part.  So many car clips are device specific, which is OK if you have a phone without a case, but what if you want to add a &#34;bumper&#34; case or frame?  It won't fit.The Kenu works great.  It's small, light, adjustable, and snaps on air vents VERY well.  Yes, it's more expensive than pretty much any other option, but most of those are just garbage, they either don't work right out of the box, or they break very easily.  The Kenu Airframe is well built, I think it's easily worth the price.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D901B4W" id="B00D901B4W-review36" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-09:</strong> Having gone to swaths of car mounts some block air vents completely even when not in use.

I don't normally go to the same place so everywhere I visit, it's a new adventure.  Therefore, I rely heavily on the GPS function of my phone to get my bearing.  But having a mounting mean for the phone so that I can conveniently install and disconnect it has been a quest until now. I have used all sorts of mounting mean from window mount, cigarette receptacle mount, dash mount, antiskid pads, vents mount, etc... Each type of mount has pros and cons, but the biggest part is the size and complexity of the design.  I have ended it up using a window mount, but I have to assemble and disassemble it to use it every time. The round mounting sucker (foot) doesn't lend itself to ease of packing, so I have to fiddle with arranging everything to fit in the case.  Depending on rental car, some dc charger outlet could be very far from the windshield mount, so sometimes, my cable was too short... Since I need the mount weekly, I got a small Eaglecreek travel pouch to keep the mount, the dc charger, and a cable together; this pouch is the first to come out of my laptop bag and is the last to go back...All of that has changed since I got my hands on this Kenu Airframe.  I was reasonably skeptical of its simple design and its tiny size, until I was assured by the salesperson that I can return it if it doesn't work for me.  I bought it while on the road, and Bam!  that was it, much to my surprise... Simple is good!  Simple is effective!  Simple is compact!  So far I have tested it with 5 different cars, and it work perfectly every time.  Since the air vent is at the front dash board below my vision view of the windshield, my phone sits exactly where I want it... and it's close to the dc charger so I can keep my cable reasonably short (less bulk in packing).I use this mount with a Sprint LG G2 and an Incipio case. The case has antiskid frame which matches up with the antiskid arms of the mount, forming a tight hold.  Without the case, the phone sits deeper into the arms.  So in either scenario, the phone is secured. The spring load is strong enough to hold on to the phone.  Time will tell if this spring loaded mechanism holds up through frequent usage.  My phone is large so the arm is stretched out to its max...To sum up, this little mount is very effective. No assembly required for installation. No fuss. Super compact. And it can be mounted vertical or horizontal by rotating the back foot... IMHO, I think this may be the best engineered solution on car mount thus far.  Way to go Kenu...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D901B4W" id="B00D901B4W-review42" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-24:</strong> Small fits in your pocket, easy to move from one car to another, if you don't like bulky stuff you will like this very much.

I was able to get this on my vent, but trying to get the phone in and out caused the vent to swivel, which caused the mount to become detached.  I resolved this issue for now by putting the mount on the outer edge of the vent so that it keeps it from being pushed any farther.  All in all, it seems to be a good mount, very easy to get my iPhone 5S (with cover) in and out and holds it securely.  It just isn't &#34;perfect&#34; for all car vents (though it seems no mount really is).

The inside part is not really as soft as I expected and it seems like it is only one layer of protection. Very cute..but the material is also kinda slippery. If you are looking for a super cute case then this works.

It fits my iPhone like a glove, the material is of high quality and feels great in the hand, and I love the little heart cut out around the Apple logo.  It looks great!Before purchasing, I was a little concerned that since the case is mostly white, it would look dirty/dingy after using it for awhile, but I've had it for a few months now and it still looks brand new (I think because of the nature of the material) and I still love it as much as I did the day I got it and have no plans to switch it out with anything else.I'm so glad I ended up purchasing this case over the others I was considering.  It is literally the best case I have ever used on any of my phones for fit, durability and appearance.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00B9G1184" id="B00B9G1184-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-14:</strong> I decided to buy this gift foir my co-worker beacuse Apply has so many better cases than android.

Very smooth and good looking case.2. It protects the phone very well.3. While it's white but does not catch dirt or get pale, it's keeping its original color.4. Does not peel the screen protector as it sits right on the edge of the phone.5. Easy to operate the volume and power buttons.6. Good size opening for power cable and headphone jack.

Can't complain.  It lights up to let you know it's powered but doesn't blind you with a giant, too-bright light.  Unfortunately, this thing is really flimsy and quite frequently comes apart when unplugging it from the car outlet.  I have to keep putting it back together (it snaps back together) all the time.  Be warned.Edit update:  Lowered this to one star.  It says it provides 2.1 amps on one USB outlet and 1 amp on the other, but, after using this a handful of times, it doesn't even provide close to an amp on either.  I get a warning from my phone that says it isn't providing enough power to charge AND have the phone on at the same time...I have a 650 miliamp charger that doesn't do this!

It also powered an iPad 2.  But when I tried an iPad 3 and a 4, it didn't power neither one.I bought two units and the problem is present on both.Also it seems to give out some RF interference as it will lower my FM reception considerably when it is in use.

They all arrived very quickly and I have put one into each of our family cars and for my sister's family, too!  Every one is working perfectly on both usb ports.I would highly recomend these not only for iPhone, but for other items that charge off USB, too.  I have used mine for my GPS, map lights, and my husbands iPhone.A nice blue light shows when it has proper contact and is recieving power, and the compact design is much higher quality than I would have expected for the tiny price.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005A0O8PI" id="B005A0O8PI-review40" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-15:</strong> I saw this on sale for $5.00 somewhere else, but got it on Amazon for $3.56 with shipping!

They really do work, and they do deliver 2.1 and 1.0 power as they say they will do. They do the job.You wouldn't expect much QC for a $2 electrical product, but they each work just fine.They don't last forever-- about a year or two of active daily use seems about par, then they suddenly die. So do have some replacements on hand. At this price, no problem.Yes, they work with both my iPhone and iPad. Also with every other USB device I've needed to charge.The LED light that indicates you are plugged in correctly is very helpful.These are great for rental cars and travel. If you leave one behind, hey, it's only $2.I'm totally pleased with these clever little gems. No complaints. I wouldn't be without a couple, especially for travel.Hope this is helpful. Happy trails, all.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005A0O8PI" id="B005A0O8PI-review42" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-07:</strong> This comes in SO handy especially while traveling!

And it is.  I have a Droid Max with a case on it, and I had to use a Dremmel tool to shave the sides on the bottom down.  The phone fit without shaving it down, but the width was just enough that it had to be perfect not to be crooked.  It's kind of bulky but works well.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008TUQ7SC" id="B008TUQ7SC-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-18:</strong> Well I was very surprised when I received this very high quality stand for many reasons. What I like best is it will hold portrait and landscape many different size and types of devices. Most all of these were tested in this stand with their TPU thick covers on the device. And I tested this with several phones and also I tested this on several sixes of tablets:  a 7 inch tablet, 8 inch tablet and 10 inch.Below I list in the PROS my actual test findings and more info on this stand as to the features of it:PROS:+ Phones and MP3 players (large and small) I tested and  how this stand performed - First I tested my large Samsung Galaxy 5 MP3 Player with the TPU Cover on. Even at 1/2 inch thickness, this stand held my player in portrait and landscape SECURELY!Samsung Galaxy S4 with a thick silicone cover on it - fits fine. Samsung Galaxy Grand with TPU cover fits fine in portrait and landscape.+ Tablets - So I tested 3 Samsung Galaxy tablets: 1) Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 with TPU cover (thickness of 1/2 inch). This fit perfectly both landscape and portrait. Note that this particular tablet is very heavy (compared to Tab 3 line or iPads), and it fit very securely. 2) Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 with TPU cover (not as heavy or thick as the Tab 2 7.0), this tablet fit beautifully in the stand for portrait or landscape. 3) Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 (this is a very heavy and thick tablet). I do not have a TPU cover for this, so I placed it into the stand with no cover and it fit perfectly in portrait and in landscape. **If it can fit this bulky and heavy tablet, it can fit most any device with ease!+ Adjustments - There are FOUR total adjustments on this stand once you open it from the folded mode.1) Upright (tall) mode (for leaning the device more upright) - this is the top adjustment on the back of the stand -- be sure that you press this in the top groove to LOCK the stand's back for security.2) More flat mode (Lounge-chair mode for leaning the device at more of an angle backwards- This is when you want more of a backward angle when say you are watching a video, movie, this kind of thing. Be sure to lock in this on the bottom groove in the stand to make sure it is secure and stays in place.3) Device stand  standard mode - This is where you stand your phone or tablet. So in the regular mode you can really fit a thicker device in this stand and sometimes I use this. But when I have a thinner device such as a thin phone, I go to locking stand mode (below).4) Locking stand mode - I advise this one for phones! To secure this mode for your phone do this: Pull down the bottom part of the stand (the part where you place your phone) until you hear it make a snapping sound. Then place your phone into the stand. You will see right away if you look on the side view that this seems to hug the table better on the bottom and it grabs onto the phone better making it more secure. *Suggestion: Use this if you have a thinner phone. For me, I use this stand for my Galaxy Player 5 which is thick at 1/2 inch deep and so I use the standard mode on that.** Front standing modes: May I suggest that you try each one of the front device stand modes and see which one you prefer and which one works better on your phone.+ Charging my devices in this stand  (and using them at the same time) - For me I can easily charge my phones in portrait mode while in this stand (the Samsung phones and Samsung MP3 player). The 7 and 8 inch tablets I can also charge and use at the same time in this stand if they are in landscape mode. Yes, I was also able to charge my Tab 2 10.1 (in portrait mode) wonderfully and even got it to charge in landscape (turning it upside down).  Although this is not a docking station, I use it almost like it is because of the charging ability (it has a large open part at the bottom in which to insert your charging cable into the stand/device).+ Overall quality, design and portability- The quality I found very good. The design I love because of all the adjustments and best of all all the many types and sizes this stand will accommodate!The fact that it folds makes this stand easy to fold and go and use at work, at home, anywhere! Yet for me, I have one on my bedside table and one I keep in my purse for when I am on the go!Highly recommend this stand!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008TUQ7SC" id="B008TUQ7SC-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-23:</strong> It holds my phone when i am not.

All the stock Samsung docks for my phone, required me to remove my case. (Which I didn't want to do for various reasons.) After doing some research, I came across this stand/holder and thought to try it out. Well, this thing is great. I can place my phone in it secure, in both landscape and portrait view. I can adjust the viewing angle and its really sturdy, although light in weight.  I use my phone as an alarm clock. I needed to install a dock alarm clock app on my phone. So whenever I plug in the USB charger, the dock alarm clock would start up. (Just like it would if it was docked.)Pros1) Easy to use and fits most phones with a 5 inch. screen.2) Inexpensive.3) Folds up nice to fit in pocket and carry with you.4) Very sturdy and adjustable viewing angles.5) No need to by an expensive dock that only works for your phone.6) Light weight.7) Can charge phone in both landscape and portrait position.

These were a perfect fit for this device and relatively easy to install.  You will need to use a microfiber cloth to clean your phone face completely.  I used the cleaner my optometrist provided for my glasses since it cleans without residue and streaks.  Make sure it is completely dry and free from even the smallest dust particles.  Start from one end, removing just the edge of the cover film, align the screen cover with the edges of the phone face, then gently pull of the film, applying to the phone face as you go.  Once it is installed, use the microfiber cloth over your thumb to push any air bubbles out of the edge to smooth the application.  Once it is completely installed pull the tab to remove the cover film from the other side of the protector.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002OKLUGW" id="B002OKLUGW-review93" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-16:</strong> They really make your phone into a mirror.

After to review a lot of options from Amazon, decided to get this one even after to read that this product was so tight. That was the worse decision:- The entire is heavy, but believe when I say that is heavy. It feels like a piece of iron in your hands so is impossible to change the position of the holder with one hand. I have a desktop with a tempered glass as table and I was very scared if this holder fell in there because it would crash the glass.- the clip to fix the base is to tight so there is no place to put it since it could damage any surface.- I tried to use this holder just for one hour; so I did put my Galaxy S4 in the clip, later I realized that my Spigen case was broken due to the pressure of the clip!!!!! what a kind of curse is this???After that I decided to return this holder to Amazon and I got my money back.

Small2.  Works while the tablet is in its Gumdrop Box3.  Reads USB cards4.  Plugs securely into the Galaxy Tab 10.1.Con's:1.  Connectivity is "iffy"2.  Lacks the power sharing to operate an external harddrive without a separate power source (Seagate Free Agent Go drive 320 Gb gets its power through the USB connection and will not power on with this device even when Galaxy tab is at 100% charge and power saving is off.)3.  Slow to identify a connected USB4.  Plug seems to want to "hang up" a little when attempting removal from the tablet and requires care to remove it perfectly straight.Conclusion:If all I'm using this for is to connect to a thumb drive or read photos off my camera's SD card inserted into a single small SD card reader, it works OK.  I think it may work with my desktop external hard drive because it utilizes an idependent power source, but I haven't tried it, yet.  As for sharing files off my Seagate Go drive that runs off USB power, it doesn't work at all except to inform me a "high powered USB drive is connected and cannot run."  I gave it a 3-Star rating of "It's OK."  For $6.00 you can access SD memory cards and possibly large external hard drives with independent power sources (maybe).  If you're looking for more functionality, you may want to keep looking.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005YWIRBS" id="B005YWIRBS-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-18:</strong> Fits in all samsung tablets with pin connector and so far it works like it supposed to.

I don't know why.  Maybe I was not inserting the drive just right, though I re-inserted it several times originally.  I was using the adapter a couple of days ago; the drive was handy so I stuck it in just to see what would happen.  Tab 2 immediately started scanning, and there it was.ORIGINAL REVIEWThis OTB adapter seems to work fine with the new Galaxy Tab 2, and I am very happy to have it.  It works with the USB keyboard I tried it with and most flash drives.  But it does not work with a compact Kingston 16GB drive that has worked in everything else I try it in.  This is probably one of the drives I would be most likely to want to use because it is small, thin, and easy to store.  On the other hand it did work with a super-minimal micro-sd reader and 32gb micro-sd card I keep a bunch of videos on.I usually get 2 or 3 of this sort of thing.  One to keep in my daily backpack, one in my travel stuff, and one handy near my chair at home.  I will probably try another type of OTG adapter.I debated betwee 4 and 5 stars since I am not 100% thrilled. I decided to go with 5 since it does seem to work quite well.  I am puzzed about the one drive it won't recognize.  One of the drives it did work with is another Kingston 16gb.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005YWIRBS" id="B005YWIRBS-review29" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-10:</strong> Great Item.

One feature I like is the plug lights up very well when plugged in, hence you're not looking for a microscopic green light to let you know the charger is fully plugged in.  The contact for the phone may be a bit large for some cases, but I've had no trouble with mine...which are the inexpensive ones.  While charging, it's a good idea to place your iPhone4 in a location where it won't be moved.  I've noticed that if I pick up the phone to talk or text (obviously not while driving) that the contact can come loose.  Simply pressing it back in place will solve the problem.  For me, that's minor but for others, it may be a deal killer...so just be aware.  On a final positive note, I've noticed this charger will charge my iPhone4 very quickly and that alone is worth the price.  When the battery is almost exhausted, it's back up to at least 25-30% in no time at all.  It may not be the 'best' or most expensive iPhone charger, but for the thrifty, I recommend it without hesitation.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003TRELC4" id="B003TRELC4-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-02:</strong> This device charges my 4S with no problems.

By dual use, I mean, the standard cord that comes with your phone is a usb data cable with a dc power plug on the end. Sometimes I am using the phone and just one twist or tug of the line and the cable will disconnect from the dc power supply, which I imagine will cause the data cable to short out over time and also may ruin the battery. Phone companies just got cheap and decided to stop sending phones with a power cable AND a data cable separately, but in the end, you will go out and get yourself a standard power cable...like this one, which is just fine...quality-wise and price-wise. Yep. Oh, and this does have a big red light that comes on once you plug it into the wall, whether your phone is plugged to it or not, so if you are one of those nit picky sleepers that needs a completely dark room to sleep, you stick yourself a small piece of black electrical tape over the light, because it is brighter then you may think.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="9985612272" id="9985612272-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-12:</strong> we've had it a month and it's working great. wish the cord was a little longer but it's much longer than the one you get with the phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="9985612272" id="9985612272-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-23:</strong> it works and it works well. i go through chargers pretty quickly so im hoping this one will hold up. so far, so good! the wire is thick and its well put together! as far as im concerned, its well worth the small amount</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="9985612272" id="9985612272-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-09:</strong> Thanks for the quick delivery time.

This case is extremely unique and will definitely get attention.The raised embossed Eiffel Tower design and scripture titled "Travel to France" in French is etched onto a stainless steel plate.  The stainless plate then sits on a hard plastic case that fits snugly on the Galaxy S4.  The cutouts for the volume, camera and power button are perfectly aligned, and it has the typical large open top and bottom openings for charging and port access.Even though it has a thin stainless steel plate, it does not interfere with the cellphone's cellular service signal at all.  I have full 4G signal and WiFi service.Extremely lightweight and feels nice in my hand.  Just make sure to purchase a screen protector to fully protect your investment from front to back.Comes with a LIFETIME warranty.Disclosure:  i received a sample unit to test and evaluate in exchange for an honest unbiased review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DB97OX8" id="B00DB97OX8-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-17:</strong> Photos do not do this product justice.

Inside the box was only the case encased in a plastic holder that slid out of the box. The back of the case had a design of the Eiffel Tower embossed onto a metal plate.  The case wrapped around the back and the sides providing good protection to the phone.  Once the case is on, it looks nice and adds minimal bulk while having a solid build.&#9830; Use and Performance - Once the case was installed, it worked as intended. The case covers the back and sides of the phone adequately to provide good protection.  There are also holes for access to all buttons and ports and a hole for the camera. All buttons and ports were easily accessible.  It also felt comfortable to hold.Conclusion:Overall, this is a nice case that offers good protection to the body of your phone.  The Eiffel Tower embossed design on the back looks really cool and will most likely be a discussion point with your friends.  If you are looking for a cool case that provides good protection to your phone and like the design options, this case is worth a look.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DB97OX8" id="B00DB97OX8-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-06:</strong> unfortunately that only meant two weeks and i am very gentle on my stuff.I removed the case too frequently [read as twice] and the corner plastic fractured from the stress. =\Some reviewers mentioned a decline in reception; I did not experience this.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DB97OX8" id="B00DB97OX8-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-14:</strong> This case is beautifully designed, it adds so much glamour to the Galaxy S4! You definitely will be impressed by the visual aspects of this case, it simply looks so much better in person than what it looks like in the product photos that are provided. The engravings are very precise and fine with a lot of minor details. Since this case is of better quality than most other cases, it will add some extra beneficial protection to the back of the phone and the sides, but as most cases like these... they don't really offer much protection on the front of the phone. This isn't really that relevant to this case though, since most people already know that when it comes down to choosing cases for phones their are either lightweight cases or the bulky cases. This one classifies as a lightweight case, but it has a much better visual appearance than most other cases. The stainless steel design works to the perfection of this case and it has earned a 5 stars rating by me.I hope this review has helped you out!Note that I was provided this product for testing and evaluation as well as for a completely honest & unbiased review , the words stated above are my own.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DB97OX8" id="B00DB97OX8-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-05:</strong> This is a nice rigid plastic case with a stainless steel backing.

I did not promise them a good review and they did not ask for one in exchange.This iFLASH may be small but at 4400 mAh it carries enough juice to fully power up an iPhone 5 (1,440 mAh) at least twice or a Galaxy S III (2,100 mAh) once with some left to spare - keep in mind that the energy transfer is not 100% efficient so don't expect three iPhone 5 charges. Small size and simplicity is what makes this model different and it can be your favorite battery pack for as long as your phone charges through a Micro USB port (or you can supply your own wire) and you supply your own wall charger.It does come with essential accessories: a charging cable that can be used to either charge your phone and charge it and a nice bluish nylon mesh bag to hold the iFLASH and the USB wire. Besides its ability to charge a phone once you plug it in - and do NOT attempt to use it with anything larger such as a tablet - the only other features are a blue-LEDs charge meter that activates once you press the one white button once and a one-LED flashlight capability that turns itself on or off if you double-tap the white button.I am very found of this model and can't think of any negatives other than the shiny white finish being a fingerprint magnet but I don't know anyone who would spend much time staring at a battery pack. So five stars it is.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DHEE0ZW" id="B00DHEE0ZW-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-25:</strong> Power Bank Evaluation - iFlash 4400 Backup External Battery Pack - WhiteThis is intended as a cell phone charger - not a tablet charger, since it only charges at 1 AmpmAh - 4400#and Amps of Charging ports - 1 Charging port, only 1 Amp (Instructions state that it is intended for digital communication devices requiring a DC5V input). Please be sure your device will charge using this battery pack.Physical size - Small, fits easily in a pocket, less than 6 ouncesHow is the battery pack charged - Uses included micro charger cable. No charger included, you will need your own or will need to charge this battery pack using your computer.What cords/attachments are included - a single micro charger cable is included. It is used to charge the device and can also be used to charge your cell phone. If you need something other than a micro charger you will need to provide your own cable.What other features/items are included - Flashlight- The flashlight is turned on by clicking the on/off button twice. There is a handy mesh bag to carry your cord and battery together (a nice touch).Instructions - The instructions are tiny but readable in relatively clear English. Photos make it clear.Support Information - No support information provided.Special Note - I actually received this about a month and a half before I had a chance to test it out. I was very pleasantly surprised to notice that it continued to hold a full charge even after that amount of time.It came in a beautiful box with an iFlash seal and the item itself is very classy looking.

This iFlash powerbank takes the slim road - very easy to carry, but it offers only 4400mAh of capacity.It is attractively designed with a white plastic case with a blue accent stripe along the edge. The on/off button is also blue, as is the charge level "gas gauge." Nice color coordination. The build quality is solid - no rattles, well-anchored ports, and nice smooth seams on the case. The corners are all rounded to make it more comfortable to slip into a pocket. Although it comes with a carry pouch, it's really not needed since the powerbank is so compact (roughly 3.75 inches long and 1.75 inches wide).In addition to serving as a powerbank, there's an LED flashlight that is controlled with the on/off switch (double press to turn the flashlight on). It's a single LED, but puts out a decent amount of light.The capacity limits the practical use of this for phone or small device (e.g., ipod, mp3 player, etc.) charging. There's not enough reserve to make a meaningful recharge of a fully-depleted tablet. But, in a pinch it can be used to restore some measure of battery charge to pretty much anything that has a USB charge cable.If you're willing to trade a large battery capacity for ease of transportability, this is well worth considering.[sample provided for review]</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DHEE0ZW" id="B00DHEE0ZW-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-18:</strong> This white-and-blue battery offers a little bit of fun with the color and a more practical 4400mAh charge, about enough to charge my iPhone 5 once fully, with about half a charge remaining.  Not a lot, but enough for most situations.  It is an attractive option for anyone who rarely needs to recharge but who wants the security of having extra power nearby. The construction is solid and smooth. I can't believe I'm saying this about a battery, but . . . I love the way it feels in my hand because of its rounded, glossy case.I am so dependent on my iPhone that I cringe when I see the battery depleting with no options in the near future to recharge, and that's why I never travel without an external battery.  This iFlash battery's capacity is too small for power-hungry devices such as the iPad. It's best to purchase this only if you want to use it exclusively for your smart phone. For tablets, you would be better off with an 8400mAh external battery, although the trade-off is a larger, heavier power source. This iFlash is sized perfectly to stash in a handbag or briefcase.This iFlash battery comes with nothing more than a blue mesh pouch for storage and a USB charging cable. You will have to supply your own device-specific USB cable to charge your device. You may want to get an extra but short smart phone cable to keep in the pouch; otherwise, you may find yourself in need of a charge without the ability to do it. Charging the battery takes a few hours and can be done at home. I do my charging overnight, although it takes much less time than that.  But charging my phone takes just a little more time than it would plugged into a wall.  My iPhone 5 went from 14% to full charge in about an hour and a half.Because of the price, this external battery would make a great stocking stuffer, particularly for teenagers and college students. The white version looks more girly than the black one, but it has the advantage of hiding fingerprints better.

I've since tried out several of them and have come to appreciate how well they perform.  They are right up there with the best of them and I've discovered that they are quite impressive in the power department.  This particular battery pack is more user-friendly, especially if you only want to have a battery pack on hand to power up your iPhone or iPod.  This unit also comes inblackif you prefer.There are several ways to charge the iFlash including through your PC, an AC wall charger, or even a car charger.  I usually charge this type of battery pack by plugging it into my PC and leaving it overnight.  You will of course, have to provide your own USB cables, which usually isn't a problem. This is a minimalist unit for those who don't want all the extras that sometimes come with the battery packs.When I test any battery pack I usually use my iPad to see how well it performs.  It's rather informal, but is quite telling.  Can this battery pack cut the mustard?iFLASH Performance:Start: 75% (4 LEDs)15 minutes  79%  (4 LEDs)30 minutes  83%45 minutes  87%  (3 LEDs)60 minutes  90%75 minutes  94%  (2 LEDs)90 minutes  97%115 minutes  100%The the performance was really impressive for a 4400mAh battery pack.  Mind you, I didn't sit on it watching it every second as it charged, but was quite surprised at how hard to work to try to get my iPad back up to snuff.  My iPad was 75% charged, but that last 25% can pull a lot of power from a battery pack.  If the 4400mAh iFlash can chug away powering up an iPad, no doubt it will keep your iPhone or iPod in business.This is a small, sleek unit and could easily be carried in a purse, knapsack, or briefcase. The top of the battery pack has the four blue LED indicators. Beneath that on the front side is the small LED flashlight, and one output port.  I suspect that LED flashlight would be able to stay on for more than 200 hours continuously given the power of this battery (just a guess). It's small, but would be great in emergency situations. On the right-hand side panel is the micro 5-pin input port.  The power switch is conveniently on the top face.WHAT'S IN THE BOX:~  Power Bank 4400mAh~  70 cm (27.55") Micro USB 5-pin Cable~  Quick start guide~  Blue mesh travel pouch with an iFLASH logo on a red tagSPECS:~ Weight: 4.1 ounces~ Input: Dc5V/1A~ Output:  Dc5V/1A~ Output: Charging speed for mobiles: 1000mAh/hours~ Input charging time: 5 - 6 hours~ Recycling time: > 500 times~ Six month limited warrantyPOWER INDICATORS:~ One LED light on: &lt;25%~ Two LED lights on: 25% - 50%~ Three LED lights on: 50% - 75%~ Four LED lights on: 75% - 100%Sample provided for review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DHEE0ZW" id="B00DHEE0ZW-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-02:</strong> In my tests of this unit, it has a low cutoff current, which means it will charge my tiny Zip Clip fully without shuuting off too early.  The built-in light works well.  Re-charging current is about .8A in my tests.  The charge indicators work well.  When charging my Kindle keyboard, it can supply the full .85A current while maintaining 4.90V, well within the USB power standards.  The capacity is high enough to fully charge KIndles or most phones.  Not quite enough to charge my ASUS tablet from 12% to 100%, but then I seldom let it go that low.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DHEE0ZW" id="B00DHEE0ZW-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-12:</strong> If your recharging needs are minimal, the iFlash 4400mAh backup charger is definitely worth a look. I tested the charger with my Samsung Android cellphone (1800mAh battery) and my Kindle Fire HD 7" tablet (4400mAh battery), plus my wife's iPhone 4 (1420mAh battery), and it worked fine with each of them. With most cellphones, a fully charged iFlash 4400 should be able to provide at least two full recharges. For 7" tablets, about one full recharge is the limit. The iFlash 4400 will work with larger tablets (typically around 6000mAh battery), but it won't be able to provide a full charge.The iFlash 4400 is packaged with the charger, a USB cable with a micro-USB plug, and a carrying pouch. The micro-USB plug will fit a majority of mobile devices currently sold in the US, but for others, you'll need to provide your own cable and plug. You'll also need to provide an AC wall charger or vehicle charger to recharge the iFlash 4400. (The user guide shows the required input as DC5V/1A. I recharged it with two different AC adapters, one with 0.85A output, the other with 2.0A, and both worked okay.) The iFlash 4400 can also be recharged from a USB port on a computer, but at a slower rate.The iFlash 4400 is one of the smallest and lightest mobile chargers that I've seen. At 3.9"x1.8"x1" and weighing only four ounces, it's small enough to carry in a pocket, and the smooth curved edges won't poke a hole in it. The built-in LED flashlight is a handy feature, as is the automatic shutdown after the unit is disconnected from a mobile device.Summary: If your cellphone only needs to be recharged once or twice a day, the iFlash 4400 is an excellent choice based on capacity, size and weight, and price. It can also be used for recharging small tablets. It's a very handy little device to carry around for those times when your cellphone battery is dying, and an AC or vehicle charger is not available.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DHEE0ZW" id="B00DHEE0ZW-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-17:</strong> Excellent for use with Smartphones and most Tablets, theiFlash 4400mAh Power Bankcan keep you talking, texting and enjoying your device for much longer.

I really like its white & blue design.This power bank arrived with a 75% - 100% charge so I didn't need to charge it before I used it the first time. I began the test with my Kindle Fire HD (battery size 4400mAh) which had 36% of its power remaining. It took approximately 3 hours for my Fire to reach a charge of 97%. At this point, the power bank's LED began flashing so I knew it would need to be recharged soon. This power bank also charged my iPod Touch 4G & my LG Cosmos prepaid phone. If your mobile device doesn't support a micro USB connection, you will need to supply your own charging cable. The iFlash can be charged by connecting the included cable to your PC USB port & or by using a USB AC wall charger.When fully charged the LED flashlight will operate continuously for 200 hours. Double press the power button to turn the light on/off.Included in the package is the power bank, iFlash sky blue carrying pouch (very nice, refreshing color), a micro USB charging cable which can be used to charge the power bank & also to charge your portable devices which have a micro USB connection & a manual.Approximate measurements:4" x 1.7" x 1"4.1 oz.The iFlash 4400 is also available in blackiFlash 4400mAh Backup External Battery Pack Charger]This power bank performed perfectly for me. I will update my review if my opinion changes.UPDATE: I usually keep my devices charged  & don't often need to use a power bank...but they are definitely a necessity. My iPod's battery was in the red & had 15% power left, when family members 700 miles away decided to Facetime me. I grabbed this battery charger, plugged it into my iPod Touch 4G and was able to 'visit' with them for 40 minutes with no problems. When we finished my iPod's battery was out of the 'red zone' too & was charging while we 'visited'. The thing is, I haadn't used this charger for 3+ months. It held its charge that entire time period.I was provided a sample for an honest review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DHEE0ZW" id="B00DHEE0ZW-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-10:</strong> This iFlash 4400 mAh power bank is one of the cutest of all power banks I have seen.  It is very handy.  Very simple to use with just a single button and one 1A USB slot for charging your devices.  It came with a micro USB cable for plugging it to an AC wall USB adapter and its own mesh pouch for carrying.  What I like about using microUSB cable is that even if you lose it, it is easy to find a replacement; it is just a standard cable.The addition of an LED flashlight is a welcomed bonus.  Just press the button twice to turn it on or turn off.  A full charge of this power bank can charge your iPhone 5 one time with some to spare.A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DHEE0ZW" id="B00DHEE0ZW-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-01:</strong> I have several mobile devices and take 3 with me when I travel my iPhone, iPad, and kindle. I try to find outlets at airports to plug them in, but so does 75% of the rest of the travelers. Each device's battery has a different length of life, my iPad battery runs out more quickly, followed by my iPhone and then my kindle. By carrying all three, I hoped that using them one by one I would have a mobile device for my East to West Coast travels. Now, we have external battery chargers, and they are a life saver.This battery pack came well packaged, easy to open and encased in a strong plastic case. It has one port and comes with a charging cable and a soft blue bag. The battery has an on/off button and also has auto shut off. A blue LED indicates when the battery is turned on. While you are charging your device the LED is on. Thus charger has an indicator to show how much charge is remaining, each of the lights are 25%. This battery pack is a very good size, small, light weight, and can be easily placed in a purse or pocket.This battery charger is ideal for charging a smartphone 100% and an iPad 50%. My iPhone is an older model, and the battery runs out more quickly. I keep this portable power bank with me fully charged to use when my iPhone needs re-charging. This battery uses Lithium Ion battery technology and carries a 4400 mAh capacity. I keep this portable power bank in my purse with the charging cable, so that it is convenient for use at any time. The battery pack is black with a silver strip on either end, quite attractive. The adapters fit almost every kind of Mobil device, and for the price this cannot be beat. Note: I was provided this product to use and review.Recommended. prisrob 02-01-14</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DHEE0ZW" id="B00DHEE0ZW-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-16:</strong> Awesome !

I'm no butter-fingers, but I have dropped my phone a couple times since putting the Acase on there, and nary a scratch! It does a great job of protecting my phone, without making it huge like the other brands.I been so pleased with mine, that when I recently bought galaxy s3's for my twin daughters, I ordered 2 more of these cases, before the phones even arrived, and told them &#34;I don't ever want so see your phone without this case on it.&#34;Last shot- At under $10 a pop, this is really a no-brainer.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005LVU37S" id="B005LVU37S-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-04:</strong> This case is just beautiful!

The slapping sound of my phone's back hitting the ground was much louder. To me that meant that the rubber absorbed the impact and neutralized the force. Mind you those drops weren't more than 3-3.5 feet high (since I'm not a tall man myself at 5' 5&#34;)Cons:-It doubles its mass and volume, so if you're looking for something with a smaller footprint yet good shock protection look for TPU gel cases , they'll be half the thickness, and usually clear or frosted. I've gotten used to the weight and added size.-The satin texture of the plastic piece, somewhat bothers me, but then again my sense of touch is rather sensitive.With that said I bought this case since I liked the grey version, and I bought that one since my father has the Otterbox Defender for his iPhone 5 and I hated how much bulk that added to the device, it literally took a thin phone and made it 2-3x thicker and added 25% to its length. I wanted something that looked good and offered decent protection without the absurd amount of bulk. This met and exceeded my expectations.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005LVU37S" id="B005LVU37S-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-18:</strong> I've had this case for 6 months now and it has been solid since day one!

They lasted very well and protected from a few bumps and scrapes, so as soon as I saw this for my S4, I went straight for it. I originally tried the Otterbox Commuter for the S3, but the buttons were impossible to use. The Superleggera on the other hand - the buttons work like a charm - and still do on the S4 version.As a few have noted, the paint on the back can come off but only if you keep cleaning the case or are pretty rough with it. The white one I wouldn't bother with as that does discolor very quickly, but the black worked out fine.My advice if you want it is - buy two (still less than an Otterbox). Keep one for day to day use and another for occasions. As for the rubber insert picking up lint - it can, but if it does, just wash it.Quick note to Amazon - please realize the item I just bought is for the S4. My previous review was for the S3 case. Why I have to delete my old review to post this is beyond me.

This case looks and feels like much more than the price tag would indicate.  You definitely get more than you pay for.-Sturdy.  With a silicon layer and a rigid plastic layer that will definitely protect the phone from drops.  The case turns a delicate looking phone into a sturdy rugged one.-Easy to take on and off as desired.  This case offers uninhibited access to all ports.  Overlay buttons that are as responsive as the Galaxy without the case.Cons:-No real screen protection.  In my purse or if something is dropped directly unto the phone, the screen could shatter.  No protection from spills or liquids.-Don't love the design.  My Galaxy is white and slim.  This case adds bulk, black accents and the white already has dirty spots after one day of limited use.Notes:I was struggling with several cases until I saw the good reviews and great price on this model.

The best designed silicone case I've seen fits perfectly, provides a good non-slip grip, and allows the S2 to fit snugly into my Seidio cradle.  What makes it the "best" is that rather than cut-outs for the volume-control and on/off buttons there are 3-dimensional nubs that make pushing those buttons significantly easier.  Just the effortless ability to turn my S2 on and off makes the case worth more to me than the 8.95, free 2-day-delivered price, I paid as an Amazon Prime customer. I also found that wrap-around silicone case forms an edge bumper that provides cushioning on all sides.  More importantly, its raised, wrap-around front edge creates a bumper that keeps the screen from coming in contact with a flat surface, even if it falls face down.  When I snapped the form-fit plastic shell over the silicone case, all it did was make my S2 thicker, wider, heavier, and worst of all slippery.  It also no longer fit into my cradle.  The manufacturer's screen-protection description is also a bit misleading, as the case comes with only one screen protector sheet that, if I'm lucky enough to put it on bubble free, I'll have to replace every few months at a cost as high each time, as the case. I left it off.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005LVU37S" id="B005LVU37S-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-07:</strong> A quality alternate shock resistant case for Galaxy S3.

If you have read this review and find it helpful, please so indicate!  Okay, I know it's the 1,037th review posted but maybe you will benefit from it. lol!This is an 'initial impressions' review - 5 stars! Very nice, I got the blue, it's sort of a saturated dark blue, and more attractive than the image depicts. Though polycarbonate, it has a subdued 'glow' on the back as if it were metallic.*Important* - Pressing power button and volume controls happily require little effort, similar to bare phone pressure, despite presence of rubber protectors. I really like this about the Superleggera Pro!I must say that it's superior to Otterbox Commuter S4 with reference to pressing of these controls. Though the Otterbox Commuter button pressing functions are much better for the S4 than for its predecessor for the S3, Superleggera is still easier.However, there are no covers for the earplugs or charging port whereas the opposite is true with the Commuter, which helps keep out dust and debris.Otterbox Commuter probably gives slightly better protection, though it is somewhat 'harsh' (for lack of a better word) to hold as it's a harder plastic shell.  The Superleggera Pro seems more comfortable and 'feels better' to hold, though the back and sides can be described on the 'slippery' side - it is more likely to slip out of one's hand than the Commuter.  Would suggest you get a firm grip on it.Superleggera Pro phone side panels show some 'flex' to absorb impact whereas Otterbox is quite solid and hard on sides with little to no flex.As to price - Acase clearly costs less than the Otterbox.Unlike the Superleggera Pro, the Commuter does come with a screen protector - and it's excellent!  If you apply it correctly you will never see any 'bubbles'.  In fact, to the untrained eye, it is difficult to discern the protector at all! It's great!Overall, I would rate the Superleggera Pro higher than the Commuter due to ease of pressing power and volume controls. It's also easier on removal and installation if you want to change batteries or case to another, and I just like it's feel in the hand better...it's also seems a little less bulky than the Commuter.So the question is: "Which is 'better' for you"?  That's a subjective call and you will likely be happy with either, or consider getting both!  I have both and intend to keep them!This review will be updated as appropriate.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005LVU37S" id="B005LVU37S-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-22:</strong> This was purchased for a Galaxy S3.

I wanted a case that was cheap enough where I wouldn't feel bad buying. The purpose is to find a well respected case brand that can offer great protection (from my 5 year old) after which I may change into a better case in the future as more manufacturers make cases and the selection is wider.First impression: Felt just like an Incase case with the smooth matte finish. Very sturdy and protects the phone well. This pretty much doubles the weight of the phone and so the phone feels sturdy and protected in the hands. I can definitely feel it in my pocket now. The buttons are cushy and easy to press. I wouldn't be worried if I dropped the phone.Things I notice of why I am only giving it 4 stars: As mentioned by another reviewer, it does collect pocket dust easily and is not easy to rub off with your hands. Maybe a cloth will help. The silicon on the two sides of the case where the buttons are easy to move around. This is the nature of soft silicon, but it would have been better if that area was a little stiffer instead of moving around. It would have been nice if the silicone was built with out a separate mold. I hate lines. Another thing is that the silicon at the top of the case does not look as clean and smooth as the bottom. I'm not sure why, maybe a molding issue, but it doesn't bother me all that much.I think it's a great deal for the price. Will have to see how the case holds up after a few weeks of use. Hopefully the paint won't peel like my Incase did (iPhone) awhile back. One note, another reviewer said they didn't get the "Acase" logo on the back of their case, but mine had it. No big deal for me.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005LVU37S" id="B005LVU37S-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-29:</strong> OK, I almost forgot I owned this case, because I have so many cases for my phone, but this is a pretty reliable case. It's affordable, & it will take a good hit or two. I have yet to give it a true battle of abuse, because I rarely try to drop my phone. However, if it were to drop, I think it could handle the bumps and bruises necessary to survive. What makes it a good case by far is the infamous matte finish, which is a gift & a curse for a lot of people. Just something to think about when it comes to possibly leaving marks/scratches. If you're looking to make a good investment in a case & don't want to spend a lot of money I would definitely recommend this case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005LVU37S" id="B005LVU37S-review28" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-05:</strong> Love this case .buttons are soft to press .case is slim .and nice looking. recommend for anybody looking to protect galaxy s3</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005LVU37S" id="B005LVU37S-review29" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-13:</strong> needed a case for my s3 because its akward to hold!

Has one huge flaw.. discoloration. I bought the white one and it's ugggggly right now. I have no idea how to get the yellowing off and not even the magic sponge works on it. My friend has the same white S3 as I do, and the otterbox which is prettier with the gray lining (rather than the black of this case). Hers is newer, but so far, no discoloration. It's also more slippery than this case, which is not really a good thing. For this one, 4 stars for its protection, grippy feel and ease of installation, but the yellowing on a white case forces me to replace it.One more thing: it took me over a week and a half to get it with budget shipping, it was several days before it shipped. That's unsatisfactory, pretty sure lame ponies could have gotten it here faster. So cough up the money for Amazon Prime or up your shipping speed because they ship slow!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005LVU37S" id="B005LVU37S-review32" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-03:</strong> the quality of this protection sheild is high. tight,  Tough and nice touch feeling. but the port for the audio is a little bit small so that some big audio jack will have a little hard time to fit in.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005LVU37S" id="B005LVU37S-review33" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-19:</strong> My wife has an otterbox commuter for the same phone and her's is marginally better but not by much.

That is my biggest complaint against the commuter case, the buttons are VERY hard to press. This case is 100X better in that regard. Very easy to push with a pleasant feel to it. I wouldn't hesitate to get this case again. One last thing, this case has very slight notching at the top and bottom for the speaker and push button. The commuter case doesn't which makes the phone button more accessible than the commuter case. I &#34;graduated&#34; this this case from the myriad of cheaper varieties (one layer plastic).

Slide into and out of my pocket easily, protect well, good button feel, grippy backside so it doesnt slide when on a smooth surface and not a lint trap. Ive had the Otterbox Commuter, Casemate Tough, and several other cheapo case from ebay. Ive sold all those other cases and ALWAYS end up coming back to this case. I was afraid of the rather untested drop protection factor as it isnt the Defender case and nor does it advertise to be. Well I recently had a 4 ft drop of my phone on a corner and low and behold the case saved my screen and investment. I HIGHLY recommend this case. Ive had acase covers before and have had good luck with them as well. The otterbox commuter was loose fitting and unimpressive for the high price. This Acase is every bit as protective and fits far better. After 6 months of use (I use this phone with a RAM mount on my motorcycle whenever I need NAVI)it still looks great. Button feel is great and actually improves the easy of use.

The look that says, "I love you, but if you're going to have a nicer phone that me, it had better stay looking immaculate!"Over the years, I've sampled a modicum of cases on various smartphones. One of my favorites was a Seidio Active Case for my EVO 4G. This case reminds me a lot of the Seidio, but with two main differences: the soft-touch coating hasn't shown any signs of wearing off after 3 months of use (my Seidio had shiny plastic spots showing within 2 weeks where the coating had rubbed off), and the Acase was less than half the cost.I bought this case after reading high recommendations from folks at both SlickDeals and XDA-Developers, and I couldn't be more pleased with how it's held up. The design is simple but elegant. I really like dual-layer cases like this with a shock-absorbing inner layer, but the trade-off is generally that they add bulk. They GSIII is already a large phone, but this case didn't feel like it made it over-sized or ungainly. It's about as thin of an addition as I could have hoped for while still providing the protection of a two-layer case.One of the best pieces of news is that even though the silicon covers the volume and power buttons, they are still very easy to push while the phone is in the case. One of my main gripes with my Seidio cases has been having to struggle to press the buttons through the case, but that's been a non-issue with the Acase. Reviews stating as such are one of the reasons I opted to purchase this case to begin with, but I was still pleasantly surprised when I tried it in person and realized just how little the case impeded button presses.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005LVU37S" id="B005LVU37S-review45" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-05:</strong> Bought the case for a cheap price.  I needed three ASAP so it was nice it came with Prime shipping.  The case is smooth so it comes out of the pocket easily.  My wife does not like how smooth it is as she keeps it in her purse and she is more concerned with it slipping out of her hands since she has smaller hands than I do.  So beware if you're buying this for a female.  Great for me because it used to be a hassle getting the Galaxy SII out of my pocket while I was sitting in my car.

I'm very rigorous when it comes to testing and this case lived up to everything it claimed.  AT&T;, T-Mobile, and Sprint are providing the smartphone, but if you want protection for your phone at a very reasonable price I'd highly recommend Acase.  The Superleggera PRO is a dual layer protective case with a rubberized silicone case and a polycarbonate snap-on case.Peanut butter.  You can't get much greasier and grimy than a peanut butter smear, which went directly onto the polycarbonate case.  Yes, it did settle in briefly, but when I took a damp cloth it readily wiped off without leaving a residue.  Needless to say, my fingerprints did not show up on either case.  Acase's "anti-fingerprint" claim surprisingly passed my test as did the "anti-scratch" one.  Writing utensils, fingernails, and drops didn't scratch it, let alone dent it.Newstribe calls the Galaxy S3 the "most powerful smartphone in the world," but it will be useless without adequate protection.  The silicone rim is slightly higher than the phone so when place on a table it is less likely to scratch your screen.  The dimensions of the phone are136.6 x 70.6 x 8.6 mm and the lip of the silicone case raises it up sufficiently.  I like the double layer "armor" and the sleek black look.  If you prefer another color this case comes inwhite,purple/black,blue/black, andred/black.  Simply click on the color and you'll be taken to the order/description page. This case is an excellent, sleek product that lives up to its description.  Highly recommended.Sample case courtesy of Acase.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005LVU37S" id="B005LVU37S-review49" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-14:</strong> I've used several different smartphone cases over the years, and this one is definitely one of the sturdiest and most impact resistant that I've come across. It has a very innovative design - it's essentially two cases, snuggly wrapped around each other. The "inner" case is a rubberized silicone sleeve that looks like a swimming bodysuit. It's very easy to put on your Galaxy S3 smartphone. The outer case is hard polycarbonate case that's a bit trickier to put, but otherwise very well built and it gives you the sense of sturdiness and protection. This dual layer approach to smartphone casing is meant to give an increased impact-resistance, and a much more protective case than most single-layer cases. If you are clumsy with your smartphone, then you should definitely check out this particular case.The case is fingerprint-proof and scratch-resistant, and it has all the appropriate openings for the headphones, camera, and the charging dock. The volume control is covered with the rubbery case, and it somewhat diminishes the sensitivity of those buttons. The texture of the case feels really good in your hand and it provides you with a solid and comfortable grip.Overall, this is a very nice looking and well-designed product that will give your Galaxy S3 smartphone additional protection, and provide you with a peace of mind while using it in all sorts of situations.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005LVU37S" id="B005LVU37S-review50" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-25:</strong> The new S3 is so light and wafer thin that there's not much to hold on to.  I've already dropped it a few times trying to pick it up quickly but not touch the screen until I was ready to answer the call.  This case fills out around the phone and gives you a very tactile sense when grasping it.  You really feel like you can grip it securely as you use it and put it down, either face up or down, and feel like it won't break.  The only down side is that now it doesn't fit the belt clip pouch that I bought for it.  that pouch, bought on Amazon, is made for the phone without a case on it.  It also will not fit in the charging dock, also purchased her on Amazon, because the case makes it too thick to fit in the slot.  However, I would give up both of those things for this case.  The case is far more critical for me than either of those two things.  I'll just have to find a bigger belt pouch, and I've purchased several wall chargers on eBay for three bucks each, so I just plug the phone in and I don't use a dock.  The dock was nice because I work at home and it provided a nice stand for the phone so that it was upright, rather than laying down on my desk.  But, not a big deal.  I would buy this case again.  I have a white S3 and I can tell that this case will get dirty and scuffed because it's also white, but I'd recommend it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005LVU37S" id="B005LVU37S-review51" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-25:</strong> This case is fantastic.

First to arrive and nicely packaged. Was easy to get on phone and the dual rubber-hardback cover seems secure. I like that the corners especially have both the rubber under cover and then the hard cover over the top. Have not tested a drop onto an overly hard surface, and hopefully won't need to but would think that it would provide reasonable protection from a waist-high drop. Overall a nice case and buttons work perfectly through the case.A FEW THINGS TO NOTE1. A few scuffs show up from regular use, but nothing of great concern2. Provides a nice lip for screen protection3. Even though it fits over a screen cover, the flexible rubber moves around enough with regular use to eventually push againt the edges of the cover and peel it up4. A little difficult to get off on a regular basis but shouldn't be a problem if you don't need to constantly access your phone's innardsOverall a well made cover that promises adequate protection during daily use. Wouldn't throw the phone against the wall, but keeps mind at ease knowing a drop from a table probably won't kill the phone.UPDATE 18Feb2013Phone dropped out of wife's bag onto tarmac in parking lot, probably a 2'-3' drop ... landed on edge and then face down. I could barely detect where case had hit the ground, but I think it was the bottom left corner as that's the only area I found a very tiny scuff. Phone seems unperturbed. Case has a decent lip on it which also seems to have protected the screen. (I did put screen-cover on a while back which also probably helped) So overall, the case did it's job. One thing though, the white sure does start looking "off-white" after many jeans pocket visits.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005LVU37S" id="B005LVU37S-review54" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-16:</strong> this case looks like the seido case, but it is cheaper.

I was looking for a case that had a better tactile experience as well as one that would protect such a high-priced phone.  This case fits the bill perfectly.  I've had phone cases in the past that were slightly misaligned with buttons and sensors, but the designers of this case (and the phone itself) did a good job in avoiding that problem. The openings in the silicone are nicely formed, some are even beveled, and give complete access to the ports and sensors they're protecting.  The soft silicone inner case also has raised sections over the buttons on either side of the face that fit in slots on the hard shell and follow the line of the outer shell.  The silicone is very soft and allows a good feel of the mechanical buttons they're covering, which respond with minimal pressure. The edge of the silicone reaches over and sits a little proud of the phone's face all around and the outer plastic shell curls over the silicone to make a nice pressure-fit grip on the phone, also making sure that the plane of the phone's face is inset below the case edges - a preferred protection. When calling, the case is practically imperceptible.If you install a screen-protector sheet on the phone's face for full protection (not included with this case - I always recommend Skinomi products!), the silicone is soft enough to not disturb the edge of the sheet, but may lift it if you're not careful when putting the cover back on after installing the sheet.The outer hard case is thin and light, and has a matte finish that feels like most modern plastics, cool to the touch but not slick.  I have the white case and it can smudge a little bit after awhile. (Finger skin oils don't go away, do they?) But it's easily cleaned. The full case adds a little width and a little thickness to the naked phone, as real protection should, but the weight added by the case is just enough to make the phone feel more substantial in the hand, but never heavy.  The phone's incredibly light already, and so is the case.With this case, the phone still fits easily in my shirt breast pocket or pants pocket. I don't like belt packs personally, but as others have mentioned here, I'm sure you'll have to check specific interior sizes on packs to see if the phone + protective case will fit inside.Overall, I'm very happy with this case.  Because I got the white SIII - I've always misplaced black phones - and the white case, I can't help thinking the combination reminds me of a Star Wars Storm Trooper.  Yeah, I know, but it's fun.

I have a small crack on the bottom corner of my device, and this covers it, which is huge plus for me. But overall, the case is just a joy to use. It doesn't add too much bulk, probably less than half of what you'd get with an Otterbox. The matte finish feels amazing , but it does seem a bit slippery. I'm a fan of matte finishes, so that's not something that bothers me. The lip on the front is nice. it's not obtrusive, and definitely protects the face of the phone. This case just feels great.

Only one notable negative:  Not very screen protector friendly (just like many phone cases out there). Tends to lift the edges of screen protectors after just a few days.

I noticed some reviewers are reporting that the case is slippery. I can only assume they received a different case than I did. This case is simply not slippery, I mean it can sit on the dash of a car and not slide around. I have devised a test to demonstrate this level of grip. I will post a picture of it sitting on a piece of paper at an angle to see how steep of an angle is required before it starts to slip. I imagine it is more than 45 degrees. For the price, I can't recommend this case enough.I am reviewing this case as I bought it. It paid $3.99 for the black version.This case is somewhere between a silicone case and an Otterbox, while being cheaper than both of them in some cases. This case has a relatively grippy (not sticky) inner silicone shell. On top of that, you get a rubberized plastic piece that covers the corners, sides and back of the phone.Around the screen, the case has a raised edge. This way your screen can't make contact with a surface if you set your phone face down. The back is soft touch covered plastic and feels very high quality. It is just the right balance of grip and slip. I need it to slip into my pocket, and I don't want lint from my pocket sticking to it. With silicone cases, it is hard to get the phone in my pocket because they're almost sticky. They also attract lint which is annoying. This case won't slip out of your hand, but it isn't as sticky as silicone. It also covers the camera nicely, so it doesn't touch the table when you set it down screen up.With the soft touch plastic covering the corners and a layer of silicone to absorb shocks, I can confirm that this case can easily handle drops from chest height (4-6) feet. I wouldn't see how high it can go, but it definitely protects your device from accidental drops. The silicone case also slightly covers the edge of the phone screen bezel, so no dirt gets in between the phone and the case. It also helps protect the screen because even gorilla glass breaks easily if you hit it on the edge. With this case, it is covered. The buttons and everything work just fine. My normal power plug and headphones work great too.For anyone who doesn't want the bulk of an Otterbox, but still wants some good drop protection, this is a great case to consider. It also costs a fraction of the Otterboxes for the Galaxy 3. For $3.99, It's a case everyone should have. I had this in my cart for a long time, and it used to cost $15. I thought I'd wait and see if the price would go down, and now I got it for $3.99. For those familiar with Otterbox, this case is of equal build quality. The protection is reversed though. The hard plastic shell goes around a shock absorbing silicone layer.I highly recommend this to all my friends. Two of them bought a case as soon as they heard the price. I missed that soft touch material featured on droids. Now, I can have it again for under $4! If you're even considering it, just buy it. Amazon's return policy is ace, so you can always return it if you don't like it. Seeing it in person, it's hard to imagine that it cost $4. It is a great case for an unbelievable price.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005LVU37S" id="B005LVU37S-review82" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-19:</strong> I purchased this case for my S3 because of the look and the price was pretty hard to beat, I was expecting to get a case that would work until I found a better one.

Some helped but all pointed to the same brands (Otterbox for ie.) for a good protection with energy absorption. Got to even think on a D30 case that crossed my mind, but it's too ugly.I was looking for a case with good/excellent shock absorption since the screen on the S4 is around $300 ! (You can get a Nexus 4 for that). It looked like this was a good one, good big pictures and nice description on the item.The case is made out of 3 materials divided in 2 parts:- Internal soft rubber just like a Otterbox, very little difference on thickness as this is thinner- Outer solid plastic shell with really soft rubberized feeling like on fancy electronicsThey fit PERFECTLY between themselves and working with the phone:It's 1/4 of the Otterbox price and I thought the soft rubber internal would be trash on the sizes and fittings for the buttons. What an excellent surprise to see that the side buttons simply fit PERFECTLY. Otterbox must learn with Acase!The thinner rubber can make the phone+case VERY thin. It's totally worth to wear it on the phone. With the otterbox it's just too big, too sturdy. When showing the phone had to take it off but with Acase it's perfectly slim and fits nicely inside the pocket.The outside rubberized finishing is like the fancy electronics and as stated leaves no fingerprints marks for a lot of time, but if you eat something like fries then it stains just a little bit - a wet damper can easily clean it.Got so happy about it that bought a second one as a gift!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005LVU37S" id="B005LVU37S-review84" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-07:</strong> I have the note 2 and I couldnt ask for a better case.

That case was very difficult to install and then once it was on the phone, using any of the buttons was nearly impossible.  I tried several different commuter cases from different vendors and all had the same design flaws.So then I went to the VZW store here in Austin and purchased a Incipio Dual Case.  This case was easy to install but the buttons felt "mushy" and the case barely reached around the edges.  The lack of coverage on the front caused my expensive screen protector to lift on the edges.  Furthermore; when I pulled the phone from my pocket, there was a high chance the case would slip off a corner.I thought I was stuck with the $29 Incipio when I stumbled upon this case.  Again, just being honest but the name "ACase" screams cheap Asian junk.  However; this was certainly not the case (no pun intended).This case wraps around the phone perfectly.  The rubber is not so stiff that you can't press the buttons and not mushy like the Incipio.  It doesn't have a tactile feeling but you can still tell the button was successfully pressed.Installation and removal is a breeze.The finish seems to be ok.  I can't talk about the longevity of the case or the finish but it seems to be pretty good.  My only negative point would be the seam that goes the entire way around the plastic.  Its not very noticeable and doesn't really bother me much.Also keep in mind, I would consider this case to be more on the gold side of yellow.The case seems much smoother than the Incipio but not nearly a slick as the plastic feeling Otterbox.  All connectors and holes in the case are perfectly aligned and allow ample access.Incipio goes back to VZW and with the money I saved I will purchase another ACase in a different color.***08/23 Update***I rarely take the time to review much less update a review however; I do feel compelled for this product.After a few weeks of regular usage, the case is still in pristine condition.  Its holding up perfectly and looks just like Day 1.I did have a drop to wood floor from about 4 feet and absolutely no damage to the case or device.My screen protector has a few scratches but the case has none.I noticed that pocket lint does attract to the black rubber but its very easily removed with a swipe around the bezel.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005LVU37S" id="B005LVU37S-review100" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-03:</strong> Good fit on this case.

I must say I'm quite pleased by this case.  It's a two layer case.  First part is a rubber case that fits around the phone.  Then, the white hard plastic part slides over the rubber case to hold it on.  Much better protection than those 3 dollar plastic cases that spli apart when you drop your phone.  I've had my case for over 3 weeks now, and it still looks brand new.  I was a little skeptical about a white case, thinking it would stain and get dirty, but it hasn't shown the first side of any sort of stains or scratches.  I get compliments all the time on it.

Obviously the first choice was to look at Otter Box, but most of the complaints I read about it was that the buttons were stiff. One of my criteria was to keep the phone a sleek as possible, but still give it drop protection and I also wanted it to be able to slide in and out of my pocket easily.I opted not to go with a screen protector on this phone because I did not want to distort the beautiful display in any way or risk leaving a sticky residue on the phone if I wanted to remove it. This phone has the 2nd generation Gorilla Glass installed and is designed to be durable from daily use. Like most guys we keep the phone in our pocket so it is pretty safe from getting scratched up unless you keep your keys in the same pocket therefore no screen protector is needed.  Now for the ladies like my wife that put the phone in their purse, you may consider a screen protector of some sort.The case comes in two pieces.  The phone fits into a rubber piece and then you slip on the plastic cover.  The plastic cover has a little bit of grip to it, but if you want grip for it to not slide on your dash you can flip the phone over on it's face since the rubber insert is slight raise on the edge of the phone. All of the buttons are easy to press and the the charging port and headphone jack are easy to get to.What also drew me to the phone was the blue color.  In the right like it tends to look purple like some people say, but it is blue and looks great!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005LVU37S" id="B005LVU37S-review117" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-26:</strong> Love this case!!!

It not only is sleek, but is also robust enough to absorb the initial shock when dropped containing my brand new Samsung Galaxy S3. I know how brittle the phone is, so had to be extra caring while choosing the case. Since the prices of the phone has recently been slashed down - didnt want to lose the edge by buying an expensive one. The black cover snugs around the white phone and the contrast looks adorable. The first rubber protection layer not only gives a cushion effect on hard landing but also provides the necessary grip to the slippery phone surface. The second hard case shields the phone from crushing force if accidentally applied. The pores and buttons are well placed and volume bar or lock screen button cover makes it more convenient to use. Will highly recommend it to any new buyer, Apart from the fact that it collects a bit of dust, which is quite a negligible factor in this discussion, I can simply point to nothing else as its negative point.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005LVU37S" id="B005LVU37S-review133" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-27:</strong> There is not much to say, it fits and it's  stylish ,does not add much bulk and protects the phone very well</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005LVU37S" id="B005LVU37S-review134" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-10:</strong> I have three of these (well, two now) as you can see from the other reviews.

They both arrived on the same day and as I opened the  packages the cases looked very similar. Then Looking closer I realized the case I was looking at was not the body glove but the Superleggra. This product is far more sturdy with better design. The sides of the case are reinforced rubber for strength and even the on/ off, volume switches are protected with soft rubber. The body glove has none of the above mentioned features.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005LVU37S" id="B005LVU37S-review140" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-11:</strong> this is absolutely the best case for S4.

This time I wanted to try this out after reading all reviews and considering this is half the price of the Otterbox case. I guess I didn't go wrong. The case is excellent and feels good in hands. The polycarbonate cover has a nice matte finish to it. It provides good grip and at the same time slides out of pocket very easily. One of the reasons I avoided Otterbox was the problem with hard to press power/volume buttons. This case definitely does not have that problem and buttons are fairly easy to press, but avoid accidental presses. This case does not come with a screen protector, but I bought one separately. I liked it that the USB and audio ports does not have rubber/silicone flaps (I found it to be more annoying than protection in my older otterbox cases).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005LVU37S" id="B005LVU37S-review142" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-05:</strong> Not a bad case, but it now wont fit with my dock (other slim-case did) and its on the bulky side and mega-slippery.

It adds a small lip to the screen side, which will protect the screen from falls. Together the covers are very protective, and dropping the phone from a pocket won't damage the phone at all under normal circumstances.I bought this for my SGH-i777 but then I got an extended battery and it no longer fits. The SGH-i777 will only run for about 10 hours on the stock battery (medium use), so most users will want an extended battery. I didn't want to return the case though, as it was so inexpensive compared with others I looked at.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005LVU37S" id="B005LVU37S-review146" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-26:</strong> I've tried a number of cases, but this case is hands down the best looking one that I've tried.  The down side, though, is that the white case gets dirty pretty easily, and, after only a few months, my case is already discolored.  But it does fit great and offers phenomenal protection.  I actually dropped my phone from a second story balcony, and it landed face down.  I thought for sure that I'd have to buy a new phone, but the phone was perfectly fine, not even a scratch.

The first thing I want in a case is a good grip - if you have the good grip then the protection on it is secondary since you may not drop it.  This looks great, doesn't feel cheap and comes on and off easily.  I opted for the Speck Candyshell grip which has an amazing grip but it just doesn't look as good.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005LVU37S" id="B005LVU37S-review148" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-18:</strong> I bought this for my girlfriend she loves the purple color so this case was ideal. it has a cusion inside and a hard protective cover incase one drops it.

I felt like this thing could hit my tile floor in the kitchen without any issue (and that floor has claimed many, many dishes/glasses/bakeware over the years).The trouble is, the matte, slick surface of the back of the case.  It's very slippery in the hand.  I felt much more of a tendency to drop the phone with this case on it then without a case, defeating the purpose of the drop protection in a lot of ways.  The bulkiness and weight of the case also made holding the phone a little more cumbersome and awkward.If they had used a glossy material on the back, it might stick to your fingers a little better like regular TPU does.  Even the glossy back of the naked S3 sticks to your hand pretty well.I also didn't like how the silicone material collected dust.  I know this is typical behavior of silicone, but it will always be an annoyance.  I prefer the properties of straight TPU.  No dust collection, slick in and out of pockets, yet sticks to the hand.  The amount of protection of generic TPU cases is nowhere near what you get with this Acase case, that I'll admit.I appreciated the protection it offered, but I returned it.  Too slick, bulky and awkward.  I am using a Kay's Case Slim soft case I got from Amazon.  Again, inferior drop protection, but stays in my hand a LOT better, making me much less likely to drop the phone in the first place.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005LVU37S" id="B005LVU37S-review150" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-26:</strong> ACase makes, quite simply, the greatest phone cases out there.

I've dropped them on concrete, asphalt, wood floors, and tile.  In spite of that, I managed to keep my iPhone 4 alive for 2 1/2 years with an Incipio case.  I finally had to part ways with it though when I crushed the screen.When I buy a phone case, I want it to protect the phone.  If it cannot survive the occasional unexpected drop, it's just a decoration.  These phones are not cheap to replace, so I wanted something that will give me a shot of making it through another 2+ years with this one.Pros:- It fits the phone very well.  It's snug, so I have no fear of it coming loose, sliding off, or popping out.- It's a good material blend.  The base is a firmer plastic while the bumper has a slightly softer rubber feel to it.  Both are solid.  Together they give a little extra grip to the hand.- If you like the color that you've chosen for your phone, the clear cover showcases it nicely.  And it doesn't obstruct any ports, lenses, or buttons while it does it.- It has a bumper that is raised above the edges of the screen.Cons:- While the bumper is a few millimeters high, it's not as high as the Incipio case that I had for my 4.  I wish it were just a little bit higher.  It will still help protect the screen from occasional drops (and has so far), but a few millimeters can make all the difference if it ends up landing face down.- The case scratches quickly and it shows since the case is clear.  That doesn't bother me personally at all,  but I know some people will consider that a negative.Ive dropped the phone a few times already and everything is safe and sound.  I'm very satisfied with the case so far and would definitely recommend it if you want something simple but effective!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00D50GBMS" id="B00D50GBMS-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-12:</strong> I wanted a clear, snug case for my new iPhone 5c. I wanted it clear to I can show off the color. Besides the terrible UPS shipping, the problem with this product is that when you put it on the phone, it fits alright, but it leaves terrible bubbles from the case suctioning to the phone. All around the edges, around the buttons, large bubbles that are very noticeable and take away from the design of the phone.I have tried LIVVITT products three times now and I have not been satisfied at all. Is it so difficult to get a clear case without any of these issues? I guess it is. Returning my product for the third time.

GREAT case if you have a baby that plays with your phone. Won't come off (well, idk if that's true or not.

They all look really nice.  There are a few things you might want to know before you buy them.  First, the pink really is hot pink, not the lighter pink the picture shows.  It is still really pretty.  One of the cases didn't cover the audio port and the power opening all the way, but this wasn't a big deal.  The lips of the other two covers didn't manage to get all the way around the front of the phone although they came really close.

The fit is very nice and doesn't slide on and off. The only problem that I have with it is that some of the cases had a stopper for the headphone jack while some didn't. I figured that since they're all the same, the design would be the same.Also, with the white/clear one, after continued use, it does get dirty and turns an ugly brown.

When I had the chance to try this particular charger, I was optimistic.  Ultimately, I am very pleased.  After about a month of daily use, I have not had any problems with this charger at all.  It connects every time.  I've never had any warnings or error messages.There's actually a lot to like about this charger.  The coiled cord makes it easy for storage, which is a big plus.  And I also appreciate the light on the base, which shows that the charger is working (so I'm not persistently checking my phone to verify that it's still charging).  All in all, it's fast, and the pivot at the top of the cord makes it easy to plug in.  The only con, and it's not worth subtracting any stars, is that I wish there was a USB port for additional charging.  Still, this one worked great for me, and it is easily recommended.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00I7H67XW" id="B00I7H67XW-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-24:</strong> The Mfi Rapid Coiled Car Charger is a nice, functional unit.  It will charge both iPhones and Ipads.  The cord is a nice length - not too long and not too short - about 12 inches long when coiled.The unit features a blue LED light to reflect that the unit is receiving power (not that the iPhone or iPad is charging).  A nice aspect of the product is the offset power cable which swivels to feed the cable lengthwise to the power plug or perpendicular to it.The only thing that would make the charger nicer is if it had an auxiliary USB outlet to allow a second cable to be run off the jack (Apple plug or otherwise).  Otherwise, it is a nice, simple charger that works.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00I7H67XW" id="B00I7H67XW-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-27:</strong> Love the small design.

This is supposed to be Apple certified but these warnings suggest that either this one is defective or it's not as certified as it claims to be.Another thing I don't like is how the coil is so tight that you really can't pull the phone away from the dash far without the plug coming out of the phone.

The form factor is compact, so if you're concerned about your charger sticking out of the port, that's an argument in its favor. The cable is nice and stretchy. Recommended. Read on for a brief rant about these devices in general.A brief rant: my concern with this charger (and so many others) is that it sucks your car battery's juice even when you're not using it. I bought a charger with an off switch which eliminates this problem in theory, but in practice you always forget to turn it off. Pulling the charger out of the port seems like a good solution, but you quickly forget to do it. I am surprised that no one has come up with a car charger smart enough to turn itself off when your car is not running. Until someone comes up with one, I will use this charger.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00I7H67XW" id="B00I7H67XW-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-01:</strong> While it is easy there is more than enough room in the extended cab of a pick-up, things tend to get very cluttered around the limited charging ports of an older truck--this coiled cord makes it easy to have it where I need it without adding to the &#34;stuff&#34; that clutters the area around the shifter and console.

This Francois et Mimi branded car charger eliminates the need to use a separate cable although, of course, it's not as versatile as a USB charger since it will charge only newer Apple devices.The lightning pin itself fits smoothly, and it's Apple-certified, so you won't be getting one of those el cheap kinds that sometimes have faulty connections (one I bought only worked when inserted one way, not both as it is supposed to be.)  The coiled middle keeps the cable neat.  I have no problem lifting the phone from the console in my car where it charges to my ear, although the tension is there.  The coating on the cable seems a little stiff and therefore cheap; I would like a softer, more supple cord, but I'm not sure that would work with the coiled design.This is a good option if you want an Apple-approved, dedicated charger for your iPhone.  It charges the phone quickly, and it keeps my console a little neater.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00I7H67XW" id="B00I7H67XW-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-18:</strong> I'm a devoted Belkin charger user, but decided to give this one a shot.

I used it on a long road trip and the charger was very useful. The price is right too.The packaging indicates that the cord can rotate 90 degrees. When I first tried that, the rotation was not easy nor smooth. It was as if the cord was not built for rotation. As a result, the casing rubbed the insulation of the cord and left some scratch marks.The coiled cord is nice for taking less space, but it has too much tension. In a car it is not easy to reach the rear seats from the cigarette lighter socket because the coiled cord keeps pulling back the iPad.Although the product claims to be Apple certified and even have the word &#34;Mfi&#34; in its name (MFi stands for Made for iPhone/iPod/iPad), there is no indication of the true manufacturer on the packaging, so I was not able to verify if this is true using Apple's MFi licensed manufacturer list. Neither Francois et Mini nor the distributor Luzy's Storage Place Inc. is listed on Apple's web site as a licensed manufacturer. Another point of suspicion is that Apple usually does not allow &#34;MFi&#34; to be used in a certified product name because MFi is an Apple trademark. The license disclaimer on the packaging contains incorrect spacing like &#34;Made foriPad&#34; with a space missing between &#34;for&#34; and &#34;iPad&#34;. Since Apple certification includes reviewing the packaging especially the legalese by Apple, I have my doubt of the authenticity of the &#34;Apple Certified&#34; claim.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00I7H67XW" id="B00I7H67XW-review26" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-14:</strong> I have never heard of this brand before. and I am usually skeptical about such brands.

It's a good reminder to unplug it when you leave the car so that it doesn't keep drawing charge from your car battery--especially when you leave it there during long periods of no driving.A few things are important in a car charger, especially that the plugs on both ends a good and secure. The lighter plug fits snugly. The Lightning plug has a good firm snap in the iPhone and iPad.As others have pointed out, the cable is short and fairly tightly wound. That makes it good for close-by dash mount or laying it down on your console utility shelf (like I do). My wife likes to read her iPad when we go on longer trips (I drive), and the cord is a little short for comfortable use leaning back in the passenger seat.

It never gives me the not supported error, it charges at the proper rate, and it fits snugly, but easily into the Lightning port.  One of the telltale signs that this is a true MFi adapter is the speed with which my iPhone responds.  When I plug my phone into the adapter that came with it, I hear the charging tone immediately.

It charges my iPhone 5 and the coiled cord prevents tangles or knots. The only drawback is that the cord is not very long. This may be fine if you are keeping your iOS device near the charger, but if you plan on using your iPad or iPhone while it's charging you will have to stretch the cord. I could see this being more of an issue for anyone with a dashboard dock for their iPhone on a larger car like an SUV. I have a VW Jetta with a dashboard dock and the cord stays stays plugged into the phone, but the cord does have a fair amount of tension.********* I received this product for free as part of the Amazon.com Vine program.

What do you find? Coffee press, bluetooth speaker, cups, pitchers, iphone charger, cupcake stand--all sorts of random stuff. Go to their site and you'll see that they're an overseas sourcing and distribution company that specializes in getting your name on overseas products. And that's what they do: they put the &#34;Fancois et Mimi&#34; name on products that are made by other companies overseas. Since &#34;Francois et Mimi&#34; just puts their name on other manufacturer's parts I don't trust that they're a big enough company to control the quality.The first product I tried from them were bluetooth speakers. Half great reviews and half poor reviews. My pair had a bad ringing in the ear. I tried emailing their support on the webpage and got no reply (emailed 2 months ago). The build quality is ok, but very generic. Amazon had given them to me to review otherwise I would have tried to exchange with amazon.Now this charger itself works fine so far. Very generic! But it works. I actually like the curled cord and the fact that the cord can turn on the car end so that it exits the charger at 90 degrees rather than straight out.Even though it works, I have hesitation that it will last long. You see that 8 one star review out of 73 that state that the product didn't work or worked a couple weeks. Every single one star review but one says this! (one says they're getting not certified messages out of the box).Currently 29 of 35 5 star ratings are vine voice. Currently 25 of 28 4 star review are vine voice. This means amazon provided the item for review asking that it is review in a month. This doesn't necessarily mean that that they're bad reviews, but it does mean that most review are new in the ownership.It works fine so far. The design is so generic that it looks like a knockoff. The cord feels cheap and I'm worried about it lasting. I think I prefer a car charger with usb ports for versatility and the fact that car chargers tend to last longer than the cord.And even though it works fine, I emailed the support email address from the &#34;Francois et Mimi&#34; website saying I'm having problems with it to even see if I get a reply. So far no reply. The only option for support on the official website is an email address. (There is a contact form on the website that I didn't try). They say they will reply within a day.I don't want to knock it too far because mine does work fine, but I don't trust the company nor do I see any support from the company.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00I7H67XW" id="B00I7H67XW-review45" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-27:</strong> The charger does what that you would imagine it does, it charges up your Apple products that use the 8-pin connector (the small one).  What makes this one different is that it allows the cord to flip up in the back so that when you plug it into your power (in the car). That is very useful for me because when the cord is sticking out of the back, it blocks the use of the cup holder or just anything that might be behind it.The cord is coiled and looks shorter than it is (It&#8217;s listed as 5 feet but that would eventually weaken the spring effect of the coil). When it&#8217;s charging you do get a blue flashing LED indicator and it also indicates that it prevents overcharging  &#8212; and it could be my imagination but charging was lightning fast for my iPad and iPhone.BTW &#8220;MFI&#8221; is a special certification given by Apple to a select group of manufactures that insures it is meeting the Apple standards.In Summary, I like the innovative cord redirection and the small &#8220;footprint&#8221; and love how it works so If you need car power - this guy is up to the job!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00I7H67XW" id="B00I7H67XW-review46" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-16:</strong> This charger does faster than the usual charger.

This is probably true prior to the wire being coiled, however, for actual use, the length differs. Measuring the charger cord from the tip of the plug to the tip of the input for your device, it is 22&#34; out of the package. Stretching it out, with tension as it would be in use, it measures just under 4 feet.If your goal is just to have a charger in the car for charging, this cord works great. If you anticipate needing to talk on your phone while it is charging, it is tight, but it works.The cord can be positioned to stick straight out from the plug, or it can be at a 90 degree angle.

When many accessory outlet chargers offer two USB inputs, or a permanent cable along with a USB slot, this one has just the one. If you only have one device to charge, this might be perfect for you - it is otherwise very nice.On to the details: the coiled cable is a bit stiff, which is good so as to reduce cable clutter. The Lightning connector is housed in a sturdy looking vinyl that is larger than the standard Apple connector. If you have the AmazonBasics Lightning cable, it's close to that size, or slightly larger than the Monoprice Lightning cable. It charges at the higher rate that the iPhone 5 and newer demand, so charge time is similar, if not identical, to charging at home with the Apple cable and charger.The accessory-port end houses the cable connector, where it is attached at a nice two-position end point. Push it one way and it sticks straight out. Push it the other way and it makes an L, handy when space is at a premium. The connector end has a bright blue power light to let you know it's actually working.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00I7H67XW" id="B00I7H67XW-review52" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-22:</strong> Works great in my car charging my iPhone and iPad.

It could charge an iPad if needed (as it requires more).  Some car chargers only push 1A, which means longer charging time.2.  Simple design...the short square plug recesses nicely and out of the wayA couple of drawbacks:1.  2.4A charger also means some cigarette adapters don't have that much juice available.  The cigarette adapter by my gear shifter won't power this, but the one in the console will.2.  The cord is kind of short due to the fact that I have to plug it into the console.  I wish the coils weren't quite as tight as they are as the cord has a tendancy to snap back.All in all, I'm glad it charges quickly and is certified so my phone won't reject it.*UPDATE 6/23/14*After less than 60 days of use, the charger has quit charging.

Those familiar with the changes should understand my pain when I realized that all the devices I owned were rendered useless because of the different connector pin.I ended up getting a speaker I could use to listen to music and charge the phone a the same time but I was missing a car charged. I was able to work around this by using a USB connector I had in my car, so I could plug my iPhone5 USB cable in it. This car charger takes care of that problem , no USB connection is required, you connect to the car and directly to your iPhone. Granted, there are Power Cases you can use while on the run but truth is, those are bulky, tend to get very hot and eventually run out of battery as well. I have always preferred a car charger over a Power Case.I have been using it for a while now, in the times I remembered to take note of the time, it would seem in my case, it charges the battery at a 1% rate per minute, not as fast as when using an electricity outlet but not bad at all.Another great thing about this cable is that it is small, so space is not an issue, and the cable is not as long as others. Very practical and comfortable to use, I can definitely recommend you get one of this if the alternative of a Power Case does not appeal to you. Add to that the fact that the product is Apple certified and you have an excellent alternative!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00I7H67XW" id="B00I7H67XW-review56" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-02:</strong> Just got a new iPhone 5s and needed a charger for my car.

It pretty much turns it into a tank. I haven't tried to abuse it, but I'm sure it would stand up to quite a beating!That being said, I am returning it to Amazon. The reason is purely functional. Sadly, the things that make this case so good at protecting the phone also make it difficult to live with. Here are my problems...First, the case makes the phone huge! I have big hands, but this thing is pretty chunky, even for me!Second, one of the three "layers" (and BTW, that's a bit misleading... it's only two layers plus a built-in screen protector), is the screen protector that is built into the inner hard case. The problem with this is two-fold: First, it isn't a screen protector in the traditional sense that sticks to the screen. It is just a layer between your finger and the screen (or anything else that would come in contact with the screen). Unfortunately, this leaves my nice capacitive touch screen feeling like a cheaper resistive touch screen, requiring much firmer presses on the screen to make it work. It also is very difficult to get anything at the extreme edges of the screen to work because there is a little extra space there where the hard case pulls it away from the screen. The second problem with the screen protector is that, as others have mentioned, dust gets in between the protector and the screen, probably through the whole left open for the optical joystick. This becomes obnoxious as time goes by and dust builds up. It should be mentioned that I did leave my attached screen protector on the screen since I had read ahead about the dust issue and didn't want my screen scratched up by caught dust and dirt. This may have contributed to the lack of sensitivity to some degree, but I didn't want my screen damaged. I suppose one could get around these issues by removing the screen protector portion of the case, (it doesn't look like it would be difficult), but you shouldn't have to. That removes a "layer" of protection and voids any warranty that it might have.My other gripe is with the outer soft layer. It feels good in hand and makes it easy to grip, but it grabs dust and dirt very quickly and makes it look bad. I don't want my case looking dirty all the time, no matter how good at protecting my phone it may be.In summary, I would probably recommend this phone to a contractor or mechanic who is working in a dirty and rough environment all the time or for the person who uses there phone outdoors a lot. But, for the average person using it around the house and work, I wouldn't recommend it at all.I will probably be switching back to the Seidio Innocase II. I had that case/holster combo before, and while it has it's own set of problems, it leaves my phone looking nice and still quite functional.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00436ZC9G" id="B00436ZC9G-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-30:</strong> Just what I needed and the price was very reasonable .

For me there are no other cases in the world worth buying for any phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00436ZC9G" id="B00436ZC9G-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-09:</strong> protects and looks good feel like phone is safer and less likely to break deff get again love it very derable very nice feel better bout phone more protected</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00436ZC9G" id="B00436ZC9G-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-13:</strong> Otter Box is always the best.

Reason for the 4 stars is it seems to get scratched easier than other brands I've used on different devices.  As far as putting on... If you've applied protectors before, you know that taking your time making sure no dust is on the screen and lining it up will make it easy.  The fit on the Galaxy S4 is great by going right to the edges of the screen.  I had to lift it up 3 times and move it slightly to have that perfect fit.  When lifting it back up just go slow so no dust blows in.  The included dust strips are a god send too since they can be used on the protector itself it a speck of dust does get on it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review34" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-30:</strong> Yes, I agree the tab to peel off the adhesive should be located at the bottom home button like the instructions mention, but alas it is not. However, there is a workaround. If you slightly peel off from the top corner and work your way through the side and around to the bottom, the top plastic cover will stick back to the adhesive as you work it around. Then once you have the bottom peeled 1/3 of the way you can then start to apply it from the bottom then work your way up. I've tried this twice and was able to align it perfectly every time.As for the product itself, for an anti-fingerprint, it really isn't so "anti" so to speak. You will still see smudges and left over wipes, just not as much, and it is easier to wipe off. I purely got this for the anti fingerprint and don't mind so much on losing the clarity.Edit:: After having this for several weeks I must say I started to miss the clarity and sharpness of the display. Its a nice screen protector for what it is, but I had to remove it after it started to wear on me.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review35" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-21:</strong> great price and product for Galaxy S4.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review36" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-22:</strong> I love it, very easy to put on.

Zagg is good at protecting your screen and it never came off, but I never really liked the feel of it - and certainly didn't like the price.I'm really glad I tried this Tech Armor; it's a fraction of the price of others and easy to install. I watched the video, but not sure it was really necessary. They include enough "tape" to remove the dust for all three screen protectors (must be new judging from other reviews).Great screen protector - you can't tell it's even there. It's crystal clear and doesn't feel any different than the "naked" phone screen.

When I opened the package, it was the same story all over again: three screen protectors, a cloth, a squeege card. Also included was dust tape. I've never seen anything like that before. So II started off using included cloth, which was the first surprise of the experience. It cleaned the screen a lot better than the lint free cloth included in many other generic packages. I then followed the instructions and proceeded to apply the first screen protector. Got dust in there, used the tape, got the dust out, but got dust in different spots. My fault so I scrapped that first one. The second one fit like a glove. I once again followed the included instructions and this resulted in a clean application of the screen protector. I have one more to spare, but I think this current one will last a long time. I've been attempting to punish it with keys and a pen that I have in my pocket, and it's still nice and new.

In my case, the screen protectors did not fit because they were too big. I am very experienced at installing screen protectors, and this was the most difficult until I realized they were never going to fit. Very disappointing.My recommendation is to purchase another screen protector.Follow-Up Edit: I certainly appreciate the company looking out for reviews and making contact; however, hopefully my review helps to mitigate any problems. For $6 is just wasn't worth an exchange so I just trashed the protectors.I did end up purchasing the Rearth invisible defender after this product, and I had zero issues with the fit and installation. For those having trouble with this product, I recommend that as an alternative.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review71" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-14:</strong> I've been using screen protectors on my phones since I got my first smart phone (Nexus S), and this is the best I've ever used.In terms of the protector itself, it's exactly what you'd expect. It fits the screen (and sensors on the top-portion of the screen) perfectly, and it feels great to touch (it's not sticky or anything).The genius of this product is in the applicator.The protector comes sandwiched between two protector-protectors. This makes applying the protector cleaner, in the sense that it's basically impossible for stray hairs/dust/whatever to get onto your screen before you can apply the product. I've wasted many protectors in the past by applying them and then realizing a piece of dust got caught underneath, because once you lift it back up, it's impossible to clean and reapply.Bottom line is if you're looking for a screen protector for your S4, this is what you want. It's a great product, and it comes with 3 protectors, making this an unbeatable value.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review72" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-28:</strong> It is great, came with a cleaning cloth and dust remover, and instructions!

It was also anywhere between $20 and $40 for one piece of film, depending on the phone.  When applying invisible shield, you have to wet the screen and be very careful with fingerprints.  I would rarely get one onto a phone in precisely the right place.I saw Tech Armor on Amazon, and it was getting great reviews, and three films were less than $10. So, I decided to give it a try.  I followed the directions, and it was remarkably easy to apply.  After cleaning the screen, I went over it with tape to get up any dust.  Then I peeled part of the backing and carefully positioned one edge of the film to the edge of the screen of my phone.  I rolled the film on as I peeled the rest of the backing away.  There was no moisture to apply.  I smoothed it once with the card they included in the kit, and then removed the top plastic layer that was still protecting the Tech Armor film.  The screen protector film was in perfect position.  There was not a single bubble of piece of dust.  It is the closest thing to a truly invisible screen protector application that I have ever had.  And, if anything ever happens to this screen protector, I have two more waiting for me at no additional charge.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review108" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-06:</strong> I purchased tech armor for many devices ive owned.

However, I saw mixed reviews on the Spigen for the S4 and I also felt that the Spigen could have been a bit sharper (the one for my S3) than it was, as it sort of scuffed and seemed to also not be as clear as I'd like - taking away from the screen quality. After some research, I decided to try this option and I'm very pleased. On my white GS4 this screen protector is virtually invisible to your eye. It's so thin and clear that everyone that has touched my phone has said that I need to put a screen protector on it and was shocked when I told them there is one. That goes to show not only how clear/thin it is, but also the feel is very close to the same as just touching the screen. They don't pretend to have any extra technology to prevent smudges, fingerprints, etc. and if I was to compare it against the Spigen - which does - I still prefer this one. The ones that try to prevent those things with surface coating often times look oily after a little use anyway and it makes using a microfiber cloth a pain because it just smears the oil instead of removing it. This protector is just clear and while you will see fingerprints and things after some use, it's also easier to wipe off. I'm happy with this choice over the Spigens.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review113" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-18:</strong> First when I received the Tech Armor for the Samsung Galaxy S4 I was nervous that the installation of the screen protector might go wrong.

I wish I had discovered this brand sooner. Usually I'm skeptical about protectors that come in 3-packs for such a low price, but my assumptions were wrong. This is one of the best and certainly the clearest screen protector I've used. As a happy new owner of an s4 I was drawn into by the screen and really haven't put it down since the day I got it, even with this screen protector on the quality of the display is still there and almost like the screen protector isn't on it.Easy to install, fingerprints come off fairly easy, you get 3 of them in case you mess up or it gets scratched, and lifetime warranty all for &lt;$10. One heck of a bargain if you ask me.My only gripe is that their "pull tabs" to take the plastic off the screen protector itself is at the top of the device. I don't know if it's my installation technique but I think I would've preferred the tabs to be near the "home button" hole because I don't like peeling the backing completely off. I like to line it up nice and peel as I put down the adhesive side of the screen protector. Because the tab was at the top the alignment is a little off, but still very happy with the product.Durability aside because it's only been on for 2hrs, I give this product a 9/10. Very strong first impression and hopefully I'm a TechArmor customer for life.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review128" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-16:</strong> I ordered the Anti-Glare & Anti-Fingerprint, they were not HD by any means although the description leads you to believe they are.These have a coating on them that makes look like a foggy type coating is on the screen.The description includes the word (Matte )but this is not a very good description of how the protector really looks.I have ordered the actual HD screens in the past and those really are good protectors, I just don't care for these Anti-Glare & Anti-Fingerprint protectors.I sent the order back.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review129" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-19:</strong> This product is the hardest screen protector I have every tried to apply.

These ones are great quality, however, they are really hard to apply. I understood the directions and knew how to apply them, that wasn't the issue, the issue was the fact that the tabs to peel the back off were on top where all the cutouts are for the sensor, camera, etc. so it made it really hard to line it up just right, plus if you don't stick it down quickly debris will make it's way under there soo fast. Unless you live in a sealed contaminant free house, I suggest taking them to your mobile carrier and having them apply it for you there, I ended up messing up two and finally, barely, getting the third one on okay.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review132" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-18:</strong> This privacy screeen is fantastic!

I'm guessing about 7-9 different brands. A couple were ok and worked but not one of the previous ones I purchased were put on without problems on the first attempt. One pack of 5 I bought took me the whole pack and I got lucky on number 5. Let me mention that I have OCD and watch videos, steam up the bathroom and all that quirky stuff, so I'm not just an idiot who can't do it right. Having said all that, I was concerned when buying these tech armors regardless of good reviews. Of course I bought 2 packs of (3) just so I had enough to make mistakes with. Also, I was buying for two phones (Galaxy S4's....wife's and mine). Still did the bathroom thing because I live in California and it doesn't rain for many months so every house pretty much has dust in the air. Also watched the video of which tech armor sent me an email reminder about (thank you!). My S4 is black and the first one went on just like their video (el-perfection). The wife's phone is white which makes it way harder to line up the screen protector because there is no black border contrast. Though I did misalign hers on my first try, I was still able to pull it up (only holding the edges) and place it back down 2 more times before it was perfect. Whew!!! Not only are these the best I ever bought, but if you screw up a little, you can actually still make it work without tossing one. Hers looks as good as mine. Not even the slightest of a bubble or dust (thank you steamy bathroom). So that's it, I bought 6 and only used 2. We will be able to replace them a couple of times over the next couple of years until the next big thing comes out. No question that these are great and it's also nice when a company goes the extra step (sending video reminder) to make things perfect. An easy 5 star review for me!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review135" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-01:</strong> When purchasing a new technology product, nothing is more important than protecting my investment and "keeping it like new" as best I can.

There is NO room for mistake when applying it because the end of the screen protector will go up against the lip of the phone. And sure, while you can just lift up and try again, you only get like one extra shot because after that the protector goes weak or something and gets mega bubbles and the edges start to get buggered up.  It took about ten tries before I finally got an alignment that didn't go up on the edge of my phone somewhere.  Well, scratch that.  One end is on the phone edge and has a tiny bubble.  I already know that's the spot that will lift up in a few days and get worse and worse over time.  Not to mention, this really didn't seem to help much in daylight.  The first protector got messed up, so I removed half of it and walked out into the sunlight and compared the protected side of my screen against the unprotected side.  Hardly any difference at all other than the protected side is now fuzzy looking due to the inherent properties of any anti-glare screen.

Don't let the salesman/woman take off the plastic covering and skip to STEP 52) If you have already used your phone and now decided that you need a screen protector (as most people are in this boat) gather these supplies:-Lens Cleaner (or anything else with a high alcohol content) [simply chemistry, alcohol evaporates quickly]-Lint free cloth (such as silk) [included in this purchase]-Credit Card3) Pour a small amount of your lens cleaner onto your lint free cloth and liberally clean all surfaces of the phone4) Repeat a few times to make sure all debris is removed from the screen5) Lift the bottom of the film from the backside (side that will be touching your phone) DO NOT TAKE OFF THE WHOLE FILM YET6) Place the bottom part of the cover on your phone and align it on the edges of your phone7) Use a credit card to smooth out any and all bubbles that may be present8) SLOWLY go back and fourth from using your credit card and removing a SMALL amount of the thin film from the back of the screen protector9) !THIS IS THE STEP MOST PEOPLE MISS!After your installation process is complete, try your best to wait about 30 minutes to an hour to really let to adhesive set. This will prevent any debris from gathering under your screen.If you followed all of those steps, you shouldn't have any problems getting a bubble-free screen protector!&#9989; - What really sets this brand apart from the others is that they don't have that sort of sticky feeling that most screen protectors are plagued with. You know what I'm talking about if you've used your friends phone and you have a hard time sliding your finger across the screen. This screen protector does not have that problem at all!&#9989;  - Another great feature about this product is that it prevents fingerprints. Most phones come with the coveted olio-phobic coatings that are great for about a day.&#9989; - Also, one thing I have noticed with a lot of screen protectors is that after a few weeks, the edges start to peel off. The screen protector my mom has on her phone (something she bought at verizon) gets fingerprints like crazy and puts a nasty hazy glare on her screen and after about 3 weeks, about a third of the protector started to peel away. That alone is proof to me that the quality of a screen protector DOES matter.I can't recmmend it highly enough!&#9989; -  I give this product my highest recommendation especially when following my suggested steps to putting this on</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review149" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-28:</strong> I used this product for a long time and it did well. However I recently tried a cheaper brand and it works well also. It is a good product but I don't think the higher price is worth it. There is definitely nothing &#34;high definition&#34; about it. The only place that I think this item beats the cheaper brand is that it is a smoother swipe on the screen.

I'm the kind of person who prefers one to bare glass, no matter the quality/strength of glass. If you have the same ideals as I do, then you can't go wrong with the Tech Armor screen protectors.I debated on buying this product vs the alternativeTech Armor Samsung Galaxy S4 SIV Premium Anti-Glare & Anti-Fingerprint (Matte) Screen Protectors with Lifetime Replacement Warranty [3-Pack] - Retail Packaging. I chose the HD Clear Screen because of experiences with my wife's similar screen protector w/ antiglare/fingerprint matte version on her iPhone 5. Although the Anti-Glare/Anti-Fingerprint screen protectors do what they advertise, those screen protectors aren't as clear. I guess you can say the appearance of those is a "shimmer" effect. The pixels under the screen protector are slightly "magnified". That's what makes it "not clear". But with that, you gain anti fingerprint/anti glare. So you must decide do you want screen clarity w/ smudges & glare or do you want less clarity/display alterations to gain the ability to reduce glare and prevent fingerprints.Personally, I prefer the clear screen protector because the screen on the Samsung Galaxy S4 is very nice. These pretty much are invisible and you wouldn't know they were there except seeing the protector's outline on your phone.Regardless, I'm very satisfied with Tech Armor's product. For the price of $6.95, you get a pack of 3 screen protectors plus a card, one of the nicest dust cloths I've used, as well as 1 sticky tape to remove final pieces of dust before application. I can't tell you how many times I've wasted screen protectors because of dust causing bubbles. Because of the tape & cloth, I was able to install it perfectly on the first attempt.If there were room for improvement, I would probably tell Tech Armor to include 2 more dust removal tapes for customers. I mean if you're providing the tape and the cloth, that means you're wanting customers to stick the screen protector on the first try. But the sticky tape isn't reusable... So in the event that they need reuse a screen protector, all they have is the cloth. The cost of the dust removal tapes should be irrelevant. I guess if they had to, they could raise the price of this product another 50 cents to compensate for the addition of the 2 dust removal tapes.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review175" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-26:</strong> Yes, this is a simple product but until you've tried to apply a few you have no idea how they can be poorly made and packaged. These Tech Armor screen protectors fit my phone exactly; there were cutouts in exactly the right places for the home button (bottom) and the speaker and four sensors (top). The application instructions were quite through. There were even several adhesive strips included which are useful in picking up stray dust before applying the protector. The entire package was first rate and professional. Getting the few bubbles out was a snap. FWIW: I close the bathroom door, turn on the hot water and let that steam up the mirror a little. That gets virtually all of the floating dust (and dog and cat hair!) out of the air making application much less traumatic. Also, if your phone is in a case, remove it as this screen protector fits exactly to the edge of the screen which is covered by the case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review176" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-08:</strong> I bought a lot of screens and these ones are the best.These are strong, smooth and literally &#34;crystal clear&#34;.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review177" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-29:</strong> These are NOT like the self-healing type of screen savers (ex.: KlearKare and Zagg).

However, I personally do not believe this is a true privacy screen.This is more of a thick screen protector that has a dark tint to it. While it does make it hard to view from certain angles its NOT impossible to still see the screen. A true privacy screen (at least the ones I'm use to at work) blocks all views from side angles except the head on view. So from the left and right it should look completely black, in this case it just looks dim. Which means you may need to turn up your brightness to see better which means lower batter life.Although I still like the matte finish and it went on very easily. However, for ONLY the privacy screen portion I have to give it a 2 start review. One for the good idea and a second for packaging and quality of the screen. But no additional stars since I feel it fails to do what it's suppose to do.I will likely go back to the matte clear finish... no reason of having a tinted cellphone screen :)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review181" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-19:</strong> Works great, easy to apply and have had no problems yet.

I don't recommend these screen protectors if they really are Tech Armor. and I looked at the video on youtube as a matter of fact I looked at a few videos and the ones for the Galaxy S4 were different,on the top the tabs were different colors then the ones I bought with my case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review203" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-05:</strong> I have bought an array of screen protectors for the Galaxy S3, Droid Charge, and now the Galaxy S4.  These Tech Armor protectors include detailed instructions (and Tech Armor will provide an email with instructions if requested).  Overall, I highly recommend these protectors over their Verizon counterparts.  Done right, they work great.  They also work with my Maxboost case.  I can see my fingerprints on the protector; however, it doesn't bother me yet while using the phone.  They wipe away fairly easily.The key to these (or any) screen protectors is the install.  It is critical to wash hands before installing and having a clean low-fiber wipe cloth.  The 3 protectors came with 1 piece of tape, 1 microfiber cloth, and 1 card to remove air bubbles.  After removing all screen dust, I was able to correctly place sticky side 1 of the protectors.  I also used the card to remove all air bubbles.  Peeling off side 2 was slightly difficult as the protector wanted to shift, so it might help to peel it slowly.  If the protector shifts, it could become misaligned picking  up dust or bubbles.The provided scotch-like tape is single use; however, you can install the protectors if careful without using any tape.  After 2 protectors, the card was slightly bent, so I hope it will last until the third protector is on.  I feel confident these protectors should last at least 6 months (and hopefully longer).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review204" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-29:</strong> Clear and invisible. 5 star rating.

There weren't really any dust particles, it was just air bubbles. On the upper right side of my device, there was a very large bubble that ran along the side of my phone. I tried really hard, but I just couldn't get this bubble out. After 5 re-applications, the bubble was no longer there. Other than my installation problems, this screen protector is great. It feels very smooth and doesn't get any fingerprints on it. Because this is a matte screen protector, it also has excellent glare reduction. This screen protector doesn't lower my phone's touch sensitivity or anything like that, as you would hope. Overall, this is a very nice screen protector. It was pretty difficult to install, but once you have it installed it feels/looks very good and appears to be a very long-lasting protector. And for the price, it's hard to go wrong.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review221" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-24:</strong> Love this product, they are real HD screens.

It has stuck on fairly well so far so that's a big plus.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review244" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-21:</strong> It's a matte finish surface that doesn't glare.

Lining all the edges up properly and eliminating gaps, bubbles, dust, trapped particles etc can take more manual skill than the average  first time user would probably anticipate.Now the Good news:Once you've finally got it installed correctly, this is a "must have" accessory that's well worth the investment. So far at least, the "Gorilla glass 3" screen on my Galaxy S4 seems to be fairly scratch resistant - even without adding any added protection.  But I consider this product "cheap insurance" that allows me to stash my keys in the same pocket as my phone without the slightest concern over scratches.There are 3 protectors per pack. If you install the first one right you'll probably never even need the other two; they're pretty durable.The key is to just make sure you set it up right the first time - which might be easier said than done.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review246" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-31:</strong> This is without question the best screen protector I have used.  It is a lot better than the ridiculous one I mistakenly purchased at the ATT sore for $20.00.  That one took a while to dry and the surface was sort of sticky.  I like to but my Otterbox Defender case over it.  The other one stuck to the Defender's cover and looked terrible.  The Tech Armour and does not stick and works great.  Tech Armour includes a tape like device that allows you to pull dust and fuzz from the protector as you are applying it.  All others I have tried are pretty much ruined if you get something stuck to them.  Besides all that, it is crystal clear and allows he great colors of my G4 to shine through.  Highly recommended!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review247" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-19:</strong> Wanted the antiglare for my phone since the s4 has such a large screen.

It worked beautifully!! Even took the dust particles off the sticky side of the protector (which I have no idea how they got there.) My screen now feels silky soft and fingerprints that do adhere wipe off no problem. I also don't feel I have to worry about any scratches or anything, as it's a thick enough material to feel strong and secure.

When you look at the screen you can actually see the protector as little dots like on an old TV.

I'm not going to say it's a poor product, but my main beef with invisible shield is that it's a grease magnet as well as being quite pricey. Normally around 20-30 bucks depending on where you purchase it. Once the grease begins to stick the phones responsiveness becomes poor. Most people don't notice but the invisible shield also begins to yellow after some time and darken the clarity of the screen. This product retains the screens original feeling as well as responsiveness. And for the price it can't be beat. Even when you have to replace your ZAGG product you still have to pay $5 for the replacement. With this you get 3 for $5, really can't be beat for the price.

The positive side is that with their included dirt remover tape, the installation goes a lot smoother and cleaner than most protectors, and I dont doubt it will give the screen decent protection.  But Im surprised to read all of the positive comments considering how MUCH the picture quality degrades.  And in bright light, the screen is difficult to see.EDIT:  I feel compelled to change and increase my rating.  Though they do make the device look much darker in sunlight, the customer service of this company is second to none.  Also, when indoors, regardless of the light, the screen looks pretty sharp.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review296" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-04:</strong> Both my wife and I have a Samsung s4 and have used this product .

That being said however, I do NOT recommend purchase of this or any other protector for the S4.The vast majority of phones and tablets today, S4 included, have &#34;gorilla glass&#34; and are exceedingly tough from a scratching perspective.  The main vulnerability is when dropped the screens have a tendency to crack and craze on impact.  Simple screen &#34;protectors&#34; such as this one do NOT protect from such hazards.Lastly I must live in a very dusty environment, I have YET to succeed at putting on a protector on with no apparent bubbles caused by tiny bits of dust.  I ruined two of the three and still didn't get there.  Yes, I did watch the videos and did my best.Save your money, invest in a phone protection plan instead.  That's the real way to insure against loss or damage.  I pay $5 or so per month through Verizon (the MPP plan).Oh, and get a case as well, there are lots of good cheap ones out there.My 2c</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review302" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-11:</strong> Went on incredibly easily and no bubbles.  either I am getting good at putting these things on or this is the best one I have come accross.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review303" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-07:</strong> I got this not expecting much but this product does what it says.

For the price, you can't go wrong. It comes in a pack of three, with 4 stickers to remove dust/lint and also a microfiber cloth to wipe down your screen. It's a clear screen protector and doesn't take away from your HD screen. Installing it is very simple but i do highly recommend you read the tutorials or watch their videos on doing so because these screen protector are different from the rest. The tend to attract to lint/dust more than other once you remove the protective cover covering the screen protector. If you have problems with alot of lint, i highly recommend you use a lint remover and placing the screen protector on it to insure you remove all the lint, and give it another try. The only flaw that comes with these screen protectors, are the fact that they do tend to leave a smug when your finger rubs across from it, but it's nothing a simple wipe can't remove.

Clean and untouched, you can't tell it's on there.  Just be prepared to clean it often. I've had a few different kinds and this one by far shows smudges the most. And maybe there is a good reason that they make these to install starting at the top but with this phone and since it's such an exact fit it I think it would be much easier to apply the bottom end first so that you can use the four sides of the touch button as a guide for straightness.  Kind of sucks that you could get all the way to the end and realize it's off and maybe enough to keep it from seating all the way which happened to me a couple of times.  Luckily, I was able to lift it back off and reapply and still have an almost perfect fit.

Excellent protection. I've used these before. Can't beat the price.But...On the S4, these are cut TOO tight to the edges of the phone. When you install, you will get anything from a little bubbling on the edges (if you are really accurate with the installation) or a bubble line down the side of the phone (if you are a tiny bit off). I still have a small bubble in the upper-left corner (to the edge) that I just couldn't get rid of. It's small enough and off the screen that I stopped noticing it.My suggestion to Tech Armor - cut these 1-2 mm smaller. Yes, you might be able to detect a space between the edge of the phone and the screen protector but it will be completely flat. The cut of my S3 Tech Armor screen protector was more like this.The screen protector is a smudge magnet so you have to wipe it often and yes, it does reduce clarity a little because of this but, seriously, all protectors do this. (referring to HD version)I recommend this product with only the caveat I mentioned above. I would go to 5 stars if they cut them just a tiny bit smaller.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review322" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-06:</strong> This was easy to put on, but I won't lie I had worries since I'm clumsy and there is only 3 in a pack.WATCH the video, and read the instructions.

Came with instructions, links to a video, tape to remove dust, cloth to remove crud, cardboard to remove bubbles. Instructions are great - peel part way, align to bottom of phone, then slowly peel and stick. Of course if it isn't perfectly, and I mean PERFECTLY aligned to the bottom of the phone it won't align perfectly along the long edges. On my Galaxy S4 this means that there is a small area near the top where one side will not stick all the way down. It isn't an air bubble in the normal sense, but has the same effect. And peeling it off and replacing it will likely not be worth the effort.Instruction to manufacturers: I'd pay an additional $10 for the product if you would get a person to apply it for me and it was actually applied evenly and bubble free. I will probably waste the other two sheets in the kit then just give up. Although this material is really nice, the application still sucks.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review355" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-03:</strong> I love it!

The box was for the standard screen protector minus the privacy, there was a sticker slapped on saying privacy, and then the item inside I wasn't really sure what to expect as far as privacy.  Needless to say I sent it back.  Upon receiving my second one it was again in the wrong box.  Seriously, they can't make the right box?  I am led to think there are a bunch of clear protectors lying around without a box, or being sold on ebay for a fraction of the price?  Anyways I got the second cover on without a problem.  Their claims of being high quality "bubble free" do not lie.  I previously had an otterbox provided screen protector that was nothing but bubbles, this one went on well, straight, and has zero bubbles.  I really amazed.Now onto the protection.  This is not a flimsy piece of plastic.  I cant imagine any scratches on the screen with this thing on.  I'd say it is 2 or 3 times thicker than the standard covers.  As far as the protection aspect of this cover goes it gets an A+.On to the main event- the 4 way privacy.  It seems to be directly related to the contrast.  In a pitch black room, it doesn't work that great, or even at all.  This would be bedroom, movie theater, or cave (?).  On the other hand when you are outside on a sunny day, no one will be peeping on your screen.  When I say no one, I mean no one.  This includes yourself.  Even on full brightness it either needs to be right up to your face (closer than 6") or you need to find shade.  Otherwise you will be squinting to see what's on your screen or using the S Voice application to talk to your phone like  a crazy person.  Indoors it works well enough, though someone over your shoulder will be able to see it.  Rather than privacy screen it should be advertised as darkening screen.  All it really seems to do is make your screen a lot darker.  It also makes the screen appear pix-elated.  If screen brightness and HD are important to you then you probably won't find a privacy screen that appeals to you.  Now the way around the brightness issue indoors is just cranking up your brightness to full blast.  the down side for this is you sacrifice battery life.  Using the auto adjusting brightness doesn't work very well because the sensor isn't covered by the film, so it assumes that the brightness is fine for whatever condition you are in.Bottom line I don't think the privacy aspect of the screen really does anything.  Rather than guarding your information, what it really does is just make your HD crystal clear screen look like it's being displayed on an old tube tv.  If there standard screen protector is equally thick then these are definitely fantastic screen protectors.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review365" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-18:</strong> Clear screen protector, you can not tell it is there.

At least not for this price. My last one lasted 3 months. They do not scratch when you clean the screen it's protecting.It saved my screen twice. Both times it fell between car seat and console and the seat adjustment rail dragged on it as I pulled it out and it had long deep scratch in it. I thought for sure when I pulled it off it would be damaged. It was not. I will never buy another brand. Also the center console in my Expedition was open and the locking mechanism peg landed directly on the screen when it slammed close on the protector, it didn't even leave a mark. BTW, The one that lasted 3 months I applied with a solution of soap and water that came with a competitors screen protector, which felt too rubbery.  Do not apply any screen protector ever again without using this method. I can't guarantee anything or even say it won't cause any damage to your phone, but it is huge. You can adjust it to fit perfectly and you won't get any air bubbles. spray the solution onto the sticky side of the protector.and apply, squeegee excess water out and you are done. Apply with power off and let sit for a bit to set the protector in place. This is what I do.

Everyone complained about how difficult it was to put on the screen protector but I decide to see for myself. I can not explain how EASY it was to install the screen protector. It not rocket science. Watching the YouTube Tech Armor video also helps with the installation process. If you follow the instructions and wash and dry your hands I don't see it being as hard for anyone. Its super clear and hardly smudges. It comes with 3 protectors anyway so I am not complaining. I only paid $6.74 I believe so for the brand and quality of the product I can say it wasn't a bad purchase at all.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review397" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-05:</strong> I have used several different brands of screen protectors for my phone and iPad.

I wish my friends had a Galaxy S4 so I can give them the 2 spare screen protectors that came in my package. I don't want them to go to waste because I'm pretty sure I won't need them. It's very durable and I still have no scratches on the phone. Pretty amazing.The package comes with 3 screen protectors, a chamois-like cloth to clean it with, dust stickers to pick up any lint on the screen protector before you place it on your phone, a credit card sized, thin cardboard piece so you can smooth out any stubborn bubbles underneath the protector and a set of easy to follow instructions (including a link to a simple, easy, I mean EASY to follow installation video).Buy this screen protector, that includes a lifetime warranty for what... like, 6 bucks??

I love the way they make the phone look and feel. Other protectors, and bare glass with no protector, often feel almost "sticky" as you're swiping around, and this decreases ease of use as well as accuracy. The Tech Armor protectors make the phone much easier to swipe on, lending the screen an almost silky feel.The matte finish also makes the phone much easier to see in sunny conditions, and it only barely interferes with the view of the screen (there's a bit of moire, but not much at all, especially on the S4's super hi-res screen). The phone looks somehow even more "high tech" than it already does on its own. The protector is slightly stiff unlike many other brands (especially Zagg), which is actually a very good thing. It probably means more protection, but it also makes it very easy to apply on your device. If you don't get it 100% right the first time, you can pull it back off and reposition it easily as long as you haven't fully applied it. Until you're 100% sure you've got it right where you want it, always leave the last inch or two of the protective backing still applied and curled under. This makes it so you don't get fingerprints on the adhesive. If you do find that you've fully applied it and it's not quite right, don't worry. They include little tape strips that help you peel it back off to try again. Just be sure to wash your hands, since the protective backing won't be there this time.One thing I point out in my other Tech Armor reviews is that these screen protectors are advertised as "Anti-Fingerprint" but not "Absolutely, Completely Impervious to Fingerprints". They'll hide the smudges that natural skin oil will tend to leave, at least in small quantities. If you go and gorge yourself at KFC and plunk around on your phone afterwards, you're going to leave fingerprints. If you haven't washed your hands in a few hours, or touched your face or something, you're going to leave fingerprints. That's just how the world works. However, unlike normal glass or other screen protectors, the matte surface seems to make it very easy to clean. I just take my phone out of its case and scrub it around on my shirt for a few seconds, and it looks brand new again.Another thing I like is the shipping speed. I decided on a Thursday evening that I was finally going to upgrade to the S4, so I ordered these around 7 or 8 PM. They went out on Friday, and I had them in my hands via USPS on Saturday. Maybe I'm lucky, or maybe it's because I live in the Atlanta area, but all 3 of my Tech Armor orders have arrived in almost the exact same timeframe. Gotta love it.The only suggestion I'd like to make to the Tech Armor folks is to make it easier to figure out how to obtain warranty replacements. The product is advertised with a lifetime warranty, but the wording on the Tech Armor website ([...] makes it seem like only "new, unopened" products can be truly returned. Per the website, "Replacements and exchanges are not supported; customers can return their original order for a refund and create a new order for the replacement". That's....  not exactly what I have in mind when I hear Lifetime Replacement Warranty which does, in fact, explicitly state "Replacement".Oh, one other suggestion for the Tech Armor specifically for the Galaxy S4 screen protectors - The "pull tab" to remove the backing is at the top of the screen, but I think it'd be much easier to align properly if the pull tab was at the bottom by the home button. It's MUCH easier to align on the screen if you can start at the home button end, like the iOS device protectors. I got it done, but it wasn't as quick and painless as I'm used to. There's a lot of repositioning which means more chance for dust and grit to get sandwiched in.Anyways, all that aside, the screen protectors themselves are 99.9% perfect and I highly recommend them (if you couldn't tell already).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review418" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-08:</strong> Once placed on the screen, the finish gives the phone a fuzzy, grainy, pixelated look. It makes the otherwise ultra high resolution screen seem artificially of a lower resolution lower. The protector also seem to dim the screen a little bit.I like the feel of material, and it does seem to resist fingerprints. I am still not sure about the anti-glare properties (instead of reflections, everything just gets washed out), different, but not better.This is the first time I tried an matte finish protector. I am going to look for a different one now, have had luck with Anker products before.Update:Contacted Tech armor, they told me they would sent a replacement unit.  2 weeks later, I received nothing....</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review419" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-29:</strong> This looks like it will do the trick for screen protection.  After reading the reviews on Gorilla Glass 3, I am pretty sure the screen protector isn't needed but for $6.95, it's cheap insurance.  The adhesive was less adhering that I expected.  I thoroughly cleaned the screen as per the instructions but one corner really is resisting its natural role of sticking to the job.  Still it is a 3 pack for $6.95 so it still is a good value and if the corner refuses to stay down, I have two spares.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT7RAPG" id="B00BT7RAPG-review420" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-03:</strong> I bought the Nexus 7 version a while ago and loved the protector so I decided to buy these when I got my new S4.

The only negative I have experienced is once I left my phone in hot direct sun light and the screen protector lifted off the surface of the screen. I flattened it out and it was a good as new.TIPS:- Follow the installation instructions on the manufacturer's website: www.techarmor.com/info/help- I recommend not using the squeeqee (leaves marks).

The shell of the case is made of polycarbonate that does a great job protecting the phone from scratches, bumps, and nicks. There are cutouts to access all buttons and ports.The exterior is coated with a matte black rubber finish. The corners are nice and smooth while the back has a textured design. On the back you will find a "Damask" design that is very similar to an "1890 Victorian Wall Paper".In the hand, the case is very light and does not add any noticeable weight. Once on the phone, the case enhances the look and feel while protecting it as well. Your phone will be firmly held in place by a small lip inside of the case. There is also a small raised edge on the front of the case so your phone can be placed faced down without scratching your screen.If you are looking for a case to protect your phone with a bit a style, give this case a try.CONTENTS:GreatShiled TACT Damask S5 CaseFEATURES:Case Material: Polycarbonate Shell w/ Matte Rubber Design/FinishI was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IO1Y4HW" id="B00IO1Y4HW-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-13:</strong> Love buying GreatShield cell cases!

So I was glad to check this out to see if it made taking pictures easier for me.I downloaded the app, then attached it right over my silicone case. As soon as I attached it, the app opened. By pushing the black button, I was able to take pictures, and by pressing the red one, I could shoot movies. The grid was available if I wanted it, or disappeared if I didn't. Same went for the flash and the auto timer. All of the options were there.When I was done, I went through the gallery and either sent the photos to be saved on my iPhone (and cloud), or deleted them. You can also post directly to Facebook.I appreciated the fact that everything was simple, and that it was easy to use. While I don't see me running around with this on my phone all of the time, I can see me using it at family gatherings where I want to be able to take multiple photos rather quickly.Whether you should get this depends upon whether you intend to take a lot of photos with your phone, and how comfortable you are shooting photos just using the iPhone. For me, it is a nice addition, and I appreciate the fact that the app does everything it needs to do, including transferring the pictures to your camera roll.I didn't give it five stars because I think it is a bit pricy, but then most of the stuff for the iPad etc. seems to cost more than I think it should. A nice product, works well, but probably an unneeded luxury for most.Edited:I have recently purchased theSunpak PlatinumPlus FlexPod Gripper Plus for Digital Cameras With Ballhead and Quick-Release Plate - Blue/Black (620-PLUSBUB). Because of the tripod setting on this, I have been able to use my iPhone in many more rooms for facetime and video. While the Belkin by itself wasn't spectacular, when combined with the tripod I am very happy.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-14:</strong> For anyone who has struggled with holding their iPhone in just the right position while pressing buttons on the touchscreen and ending up with blurry photos, this is a good choice.  The quality of your photos will increase if you can hold the phone at a better angle and operate the controls most easily.  This is especially noticeable with video, since any use of the controls while taking video on the phone usually creates too much shaking and movement in the video itself.  The grip is very simple to attach and setup and it works well for this purpose.As other reviewers have mentioned, the software that is required to use with this product is less impressive.  I don't necessarily need the attachment itself to work with other applications, but I would like the application itself to be more functional and link easily with other applications, like Facebook, Twitter, etc.  Hopefully, Belkin will release updates to the software that make it more flexible.  In the meantime, if you want a better hold on your iPhone to make it feel more like an actual camera, this is still a fine choice.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-31:</strong> More and more people are using their iPhone/iPod Touch camera to take photographs and video.  While the camera quality is decent on these products, it can be awkward to try to take pictures as these devices do not have the "feel" of a camera due to their thin, sleek design.Belkin's LiveAction Camera Grip does the trick here.  If you use your iPhone/iPod for more than an occasional photo, you may appreciate this product. It gives you an easy to use, lightweight solution to help you hold your iPhone/iPod more like a conventional digital camera or camcorder.The Camera Grip attaches easily and securely.  It is advertised as an accessory for the iPhone 4 and iPod Touch.  I've used it with these, and also tried it on my 3G devices, which it fits on equally as well.To put the grip on, you simply connect it to the device's charger port. The grip has an adjustable arm so it can adapt to various cases.  I have tried it on a couple of hard shell cases as well as my favorite Speck PixelSkin.  Once connected, the grip gives you a nice grip on the right side of your "camera", along with a good size 'shutter button.'If you are taking several photos or video, it is nice to be able to hold the Apple device as a camera as opposed to holding it so that your fingers might get in the way or it can slip from your grasp.The grip also has a tripod mount on it, making it convenient if you want to tripod-mount your device.  I have read where some people complain about the location of the mount, but to me it is no different than on an actual camera, where the tripod mount is on the bottom of the camera, and you depend on your tripod's flexibility to put the camera in different orientation (portrait/landscape/somewhere in between).The one caveat about the product is it functions only with Belkin's LiveAction camera/video application (free at the App Store).  The app, while not ground-breaking, works well.  It is no better than Apple's native Camera app, and in some ways not as flexible, but in the end it works as advertised.  Note: LiveAction does use its own "camera roll" so any images you capture with the app are stored there, not in the default Camera Roll.Other than that it is pretty straight forward with the typical nuances of an accessory for Apple products:* When its attached, the port is occupied so you cannot charge or connect the device.* Depending on your case design, physical buttons may/may not be inaccessible.Overall, the product (and by the way, the LiveAction app) work very well.  If your intended use is once in a great while for your own amusement, the price is probably too high.  On the other hand, if you use your iPhone/iPod as a camera/camcorder more than on rare occasions, this is a nice addition to your Apple accessories; the added safety of having a firm grasp of your Apple device is alone worth the cost.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-02:</strong> I have an excellent digital camera and an iPod that also takes really good pictures in addition to a cell phone that does as well.  As for this particular product, it is good for use with your iPhone.  I found that it also does well with the digital camera.The grip is adjustable to your photographic device and the USB jack goes right into your phone.  The photo and video buttons are separate, which is another nice feature.  You even get a video recorder button.  If you want to use a tripod, you can only set your photographic device horizontally, which may or may  not meet your needs.While this little gripper does not have any affect on the pictures that you take, it does make for an easier grasp of the camera/phone.If your photography needs are modest, then this is for you.  If you want to shoot the extra miles and have more versatile features, then you will want to look elsewhere.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-26:</strong> When I first ordered this, I was skeptical that it would work with my SwitchEasy case, but it fit over it just fine. The arms have just the right amount of "spring" but plenty of tension to hold the phone in its grip.When I put the iPhone 4 into the camera mode and it the shutter button on the LiveAction Camera Grip, it popped up a message asking if I wanted to download the required app.[App subject to change, but the app is integral to the Grip, so I must review it here.] It took me to the App Store to the Belkin LiveAction app. After the app was installed, I could hit the shutter button and the app automatically launched. The app does give access to both the front and rear camera, has flash features and has touch-to-focus. It also has a timer feature built-in.There is a separate red video record button, which is great, since in the stock Apple camera app, it is a pain to switch back and forth, especially on older iPhone models.When you do take photos or video, the files do not go into your Camera Roll, but stay in the app. If you want them to be in your Camera Roll, you have the option to transfer them as a batch or one-by-one.On my iPhone 4, there is quite a long delay from when you push the button and the frame freezes on the screen to when it actually captures the image. In fact, it is so bad that I don't think I could use it as is. It makes you think you got the shot, then saves an image from 1-2 seconds later. This seems to be fixable with an app update. I will write updates to this review if they make improvements to the app.If you are simply looking for a tripod adapter for your iPhone, this would be perfect for the bare iPhone or anyone with medium- to slim-size cases. Even if I elect not to use the nice shutter button on the grip, I can use the up volume button on the bottom (if mounted on a tripod) without too much difficulty and meet my objective.For what it's worth, this is not a bad option for an iPhone mount for video viewing...Overall, this is a well designed, let's just hope they follow it up with some app development to support it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-20:</strong> Belkin seems to have read my mind because I'd been looking for a camera grip/tripod mount for my iPhone 4S ever since I got it 2 months ago. I love my 4S, but when in landscape mode, I find it very difficult to take pictures with just one hand, so a camera style grip is extremely handy. Secondarily, I have a tripod and a mini-DV camcorder, but I wanted to use my iPhone for videos now because it's just 100x easier not having to transfer off of tape before editing my footage.A camera grip/tripod mount would potentially solve these two issues, but unfortunately, this LiveAction Grip just isn't the solution. I have 5 issues with it:1) too much $$2) LiveAction app too few options3) LiveAction does not play nice w/ Camera, iPhoto or Preview4) app really buggy5) video button too smallFirstly, it's just way too much to pay for what essentially is a little cradle. It girdles around only the bottom portion of the iPhone and does not offer any scratch or drop protection. I had to remove my skin in order to use the attachment. I would feel a lot better about the price if the unit was a wrap-around skin or had a larger footprint and covered the back part of the phone. Would've killed 2 birds with one stone. It's somewhat awkward to hold, being the size of two AA batteries stacked up. Also, a data-port pass-thru would be greatly appreciated. I don't like having to remove and plug back in attachments so often because of increased wear and tear on the connectors.Secondly, Belkin forgot the word "only" in their product description, as in "works ONLY with LiveAction app". LiveAction (free from App Store) is an unabashed copy of the default Camera app. Belkin just moved some buttons around and made some small cosmetic changes. It adds no extra features or enhancements. In fact, it even took away "Options", so there's no Grid Lines or HDR. You cannot use the Grip with the iPhone's default Camera app, or any other app, for that matter. It simply won't work. When I originally ordered this product, I thought I could just slap this on and be on my merry way, happily snapping pictures like I've been doing with Camera or Photosynth. No siree, you have to use LiveAction. Camera isn't features-rich, but it's a heck of a lot better than LiveAction. This is a very stupid marketing decision that severely undercuts the usefulness of this accessory-- app incompatibility should give you pause when considering this or any other purchase.My third and equally big complaint, is photos taken with Camera are stored in Camera's roll. Photos taken with LiveAction are stored in LiveAction's roll. LiveAction's roll cannot be accessed by Preview or iPhoto. You have to email them to yourself, put them on Facebook, or move them into Camera's roll. They exist as two separate, jailed off galleries and do not co-mingle. This is probably due to lazy and/or rushed programming because Photosynth, for example, saves data to the shared Camera roll. If you want LiveAction's photos to be in the Camera gallery, you have to move them there manually. One by one. This would be solved by just letting me use Camera, as mentioned above.Lastly, the app is really buggy and the video button is way too small. I managed to freeze the app already within 30 mins. It went to a black screen when I tried to take a photo without the attachment. When I put the attachment back on and switched back to the app, the screen was grey.Some of these concerns may be addressable in a software update. They might not. I want to use the default iPhone app for photos, not LiveAction. Belkin has to go back to the drawing board with this one. Not recommended yet.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-29:</strong> Belkin iPhone LiveAction Camera GripI was very interested in this grip because even with a case, the iPhone is not easy to hold while using it as a camera. While the iPhone's camera is really good, the iPhone really wasn't designed to be held as one, the on-screen shutter is awkward to press even using the new volume-up button option. I saw this grip and although it was expensive, I thought it would solve the problem. It does, in a way. It IS comfortable and it DOES make a steady grip possible, but I don't know what Belkin was thinking when they engineered it to only work with their own free LiveAction app that must be downloaded from the App Store. The package says, "Works with LiveAction app." but what it should spell out more clearly is that it ONLY works with that app. There are dozens of professionally excellent photography apps for the iPhone and it just doesn't make sense that this grip won't work with any of them. It's probably a limitation imposed by Apple, but it cripples an otherwise well-designed, useful device.The grip has some nice features that demonstrate a well thought-out design - there are two buttons on the grip (right hand only, lefties are out of luck), one for taking still photos and one for video; the grippers on either side that hold the iPhone are spring-loaded so the device will accept the iPhone in its case and a tripod mount is provided on the underside. However, in the end, the $40-$50 price is unreasonably high considering the limitation of only being able to be used with Belkin's app. This well-built grip would rate a 5 from me if it could be used with any photography app.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-30:</strong> "Make Your iPhone Feel Like a Digital Camera". You can make your iPhone feel like a digital camera just by holding it sideways and using the `volume up' button on the side of the phone (which is now actually on top and on the right side like most cameras) to snap the pictures.This gadget will essentially give you that same feature, plus a few others. You can take pictures while you are shooting video, without interrupting the video. Make sure you put your camera on silent mode or you will hear the loud clicking of each picture you take. This won't interrupt the audio that you are recording. You will still hear a slight click, but it is not too bad.There is a zoom feature on the app, but this is a touch screen feature. And it is only digital zoom anyway (not optical zoom), so this feature is really quite useless.This camera grip fit onto my iPhone 3G (without it's case). It is meant to fit onto an iPhone 4 WITH it's case on. The instructions (which you need a magnifying glass to read) say that it is "designed to fit over most iPod and iPhone cases. The arms are on springs and can stretch over the majority of cases". I use a fairly bulky rubber case and it did not work.Anyway, to use this camera grip, you have to get the Belkin LiveAction app (which is free). It worked with my 3G phone. What I didn't like about it is that there is a quite a delay when you push the button and the phone takes the picture.  My preinstalled iPhone camera app takes faster pictures. It was very frustrating working with this app. It crashed on me a few times. I had to uninstall and reinstall to get it working again. Hopefully, they will fix all the bugs and get that to stop happening. If not, this product will get added to my junk drawer.The pictures taken with this app do not automatically go into my "Photos" section of my iPhone. You can click on "save to camera roll" on any picture you want transferred there.I like having the tripod mount. That is this products best feature (and really the only thing of value to me in this product). And the thread for the mount is actually made of metal and not plastic, so no worries of it wearing down over time.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-29:</strong> It's nice to have this camera grip attached to my iPhone when I want to take snaps.

I don't have to remove my case to be able to use the grip which is a plus. My existing case is a pain to remove. It is easy to use the grip. It has two buttons. One for snapping photos and one for recording. The part I really like most is the tripod mount built in. The app you need to use the grip is ok. It is easy to use. Not that fast but it works. When you snap photos you have to save them to your camera roll. It doesn't save them automatically. You can't use the grip to snap photos from the native camera app which is a huge letdown. It wouldn't have been great if you would be able to as you can take faster photos. Overall, the product is good but I really like it due to the tripod mount.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-21:</strong> I really like the idea and appreciate the ability to add dedicated special use buttons only when needed as well as a tripod mount.Belkin could make it a little better by letting you release the clamp or pinch to hold open when installing on a device with a grippy skin. You have to slide this on and the pressure of the clamps doesn't do well with a grippy skin.once installed it does hold on tight and with the free app is useful.I do wish there were a couple more functions. A led for additional light, zoom, timer, remote control, usb port for external power. These would all greatly improve the value of this device. However as delivered it only adds a photo and video button when in its own app.Apple apparently needs to do a better job with the hardware API. I have to assume that had Apple designed its products with support for this kind of device it would work across multiple applications.When you plug the device in it is immediately recognized and if you don't have the app iOS will alert you to go to the app store to download.Unfortunately once you install this app iOS completely ignores when you attach the device. It would be really nice if you could configure the app to automatically start up when the device is attached or perhaps when the shutter is pressed.I didn't find any feature of the free photo app that wasn't available in other more capable apps, to the contrary it is somewhat limited and stores photos outside of the normal roll and stream storage.This does what it can well, adds hardware buttons for photo and video for the Belkin photo app only, as well as a tripod mount. It feels well built with quality buttons. I suspect the device will outlive its limited usefulness.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-13:</strong> Since finally getting an iPhone 4S in October 2011, I have used my regular point and shoot camera less and less.  I did notice that taking photos with the iPhone is not as easy as I would like, so I was excited to check this item out.It is nice that this grip is adjustable to work around any case or protective cover that you have on your phone.  This camera grip works with the free Belkin LiveAction app only.  It does not use the camera app included on the iPhone.  That would be fine, but I think the shutter speed is even slower than the iPhone camera app.  Plus, it is still difficult to not jerk the phone when pushing the button to take a picture.  So if you actually need a really good quality photo out of your camera, just use the remote on your iPhone earbuds that came with your phone.  I lost mine, but I know that it worked great.  I wish I didn't loose mine.Also this grip has a way to easily switch between taking video and taking photos.  One thing that I found useful is the tripod mount.  That is something that does not come with the iPhone.  OK not all the time does one carry around a tripod, but if you wanted to be in the picture without looking like you were holding your phone with your arm in the picture, there is a 5 second timer and a 10 second timer.The instructions that come with this grip are not so great, in fact, there aren't really instructions, just warranty information.  On the Belkin website, there isn't much information either.  It's just something you would have to play with and figure out on your own.  This is another item to bring with you when going on an outing, it might be easier to just take the point and shoot.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-22:</strong> The theory behind the Live Action adapter is to allow you to quickly point and shoot with your iPhone and hold it like a traditional camera.  I really never had a problem with that.  Sure, most point and shoot cameras have buttons at the top rather than the side, but since I'm looking at the iPhone screen while taking the shot its really not a problem.The frosted plastic device is easier to grip than some iPhone cases and there is a built in port to hold a tripod, so that can be a nice feature for some.  The free companion iPhone app does load faster than the camera and if you are doing quick shots (think those model photographers) it is easier to click the top of the phone rather than the screen.The device has a very limited use range and set of features but it's a one trick pony and certainly isn't worth the cost.  If you have trouble clicking the screen rather than the top or need a tripod mount, go for it.  Otherwise move on.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-21:</strong> This is a very clever device with buttons for making iPhone photography a bit easier.  The grip itself feels solid and is made of hard plastic and rubberized materials.  The two end clips are on springs which allow the grip ends to expand, yet spring back over the iPhone or iPhone cases.  The grip should fit around most rubberized type cases.  However, the iPhone may have to be removed from some larger cases for the grip's connector to fit into the iPhone.  Grip surfaces which touch the iPhone are rubberized to avoid marring the iPhone's finish.  Once connected, the grip fits snuggly with no movement.  The grip helps to steady the iPhone and provides a comfortable handle for picture taking.  It also has a bottom metal thread mount for tripods.With the grip installed, my iPhone will not fit into the small pouch type cases I use to carry it around.  It is also somewhat awkward to carry around in my pocket.  It fits fine in a purse or larger case made for small point-and-shoot cameras.  For my purposes, I'll remove the grip and only use it when I know I'll be shooting alot of pictures or video.  The grip doesn't interfere with making or taking calls.On top of the grip are two buttons.  One is black for normal photos and one is a smaller red button for taking video.  With the Belkin photo app, photos and video can be taken without changing any settings on the screen.  Just push one of the buttons.  The app itself is simple to use and provides basic settings.This grip does exactly what it describes.  It seems well built and provides a threaded tripod mount.  It works seamlessly with Belkin's photo app.  However, it seems overpriced for what it does.  Also, I found it difficult to install the grip over my existing iPhone case and would only use it for dedicated photo/video sessions because of this.  It would install quickly and fit perfectly over uncased iPhones or those with thin rubberized enclosures.In summary, this is a very good device for steadying up your iPhone for taking photos and videos.  The bottom threaded mount is a real bonus.  The photo app works well and makes the iPhone feel a bit like a small point-and-shoot camera.  As previously stated, it seems overpriced.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-04:</strong> As soon as you install the grip, you will be prompted to get a free app, so the setup is a snap.  Unfortunately it will not fit over most cases; Therefore if you are using this, it must be on a bare iPhone.  The purpose of this grip is to take picture with a press of a button, rather than touching the screen.

However, it's difficult to hold that little bar of soap properly. This Belkin accessory grip fixes that very nicely. It has separate buttons to replace touchscreen for photos and movie, making it feel like a real camera. Even a tripod socket so you can take your own picture. A bit overpriced but clever and useful .. except ..... except it can only be used to take photos with Belkin's own photography app they call Liveaction photo (free)! So, as the price for using this, one is cut off from the hundreds of cool photo apps out there for iPhone, each of which takes pictures in a slightly different way, which is what the open source iPhone is all about - this is an astoundingly bad marketing decision by Belkin. Maybe they did not invite the right employees to their design meeting?? The shutter button does not even work with Apple's own basic Camera app. Since Liveaction is primitive as photo apps go, restricting one's usage to this software makes no sense.Let's hope the Liveaction app deficiencies are lifted in future updates.Also look for a lower price; this is no way a fifty buck item.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-31:</strong> This device is an excellent concept.  It's makes taking pictures and videos from an IPhone easier. That it does.  What it does not do is provide a practical way of doing so.  To leave the device on the IPhone is cumbersome and awkward.  To carry it around is useless.  Most photos/videos I use my phone for are not staged. They are spontaneous and to have to pull this out, stick it on my phone and THEN take the shot is too much work and most likely I've missed what I wanted to capture anyway.Add in the fact that a specific application is manditory.Now add in the suggested retail price.Not worth (at least not for me).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-13:</strong> As far as the product itself goes, it's well made and functions as it is designed to - so I can't really say anything bad about it's construction or inherent design. The biggest negative for me is that you have to use belkin's proprietary app to use the grip and there is where I find my biggest cause for concern.  Right now the app works fine but there's no telling what could happen in the future when Belkin has moved on to other products.  Also, is this product really necessary? I find little difference between using the grip and not using it.  For me, videos on my phone are more spontaneous things I take instead of planned events.  The mount does work well and attaches to my small, portable mount easily.

The grip uses an adjustable arm to cradle an iPhone regardless of the width of the iPhone case.  It plugs right into the USB jack in the bottom of the phone.  There are two buttons: One for photographs and one for videos.  The video recorder button is a bit diminutive in size and oftentimes, difficult to feel for.  The photographic button is just the right size.  Unfortunately, there are no connecting ports on the grip to allow for iPhone charging without having to remove the iPhone from the device.  This is a big negative for me, since I have to remove the phone to dock it for recharging.  There is a tripod mount that allows for mounting of the grip/iPhone; however, since there is no accessory hole to keep the grip from rotating, this grip will only work in the horizontal, not vertical or angled orientation.The Grip functions with the Live Action App that is downloaded from the iTunes store.  Installation of software is simple.  Since this accessory operations ONLY through the application, it is necessary to dock the icon in the home screen (at least that is what I did).  Unfortunately, this grip only works through the app and not any other iPhone application such as the Facebook app, intrinsic camera app, Yelp!, Demon Cam, etc.  That is a major limitation of this particular peripheral.The application itself is decent.  It allows the user to take photographs and videos easily with just a push of the mechanical button.  Control for timer shooting and flash customization just like the intrinsic camera app are possible.  Unfortunately, the app stores the photos and videos in its own application jacket, not the Camera Roll.  It can be exported to the Camera Roll or Facebook but not YouTube.  Bear in mind, this grip only facilitates photography as limited by the technology of the iPhone. It in no way enhances the experience except for simplicity and ergonomics.ConsLimited mounting option for tripodsApplication is necessary for photography and videographyGrip/functions only function within the appNo external port to allow for seamless chargingExtra steps for exporting to YouTubeNot compatible with other iPhone camera apps/functionsProsSimple toggling of photography and videographyErgonomic design of handleTripod capable (WITH LIMITATIONS)OverallOverall, this is a decent product with some big limitations in my book.  Certainly, future iterations of the applications can be good workarounds for improved functionality.  The tripod mount is quite limited.Because of some major limitations, I must say that it has limited use as of this writing.  It's decent but not great.  It's just OK in my book.

The trigger button on the grip works great with the app; unfortunately, it only triggers the shutter in the LiveAction app, a significant limitation.The standard threaded mount is very convenient and worked well with my mini-tripod.

But I have to agree with several other reviewers: why oh why did Belkin pair this promising grip with such a half-baked app?  No serious photographer would use their app. Without being able to use their trigger button functionality in a decent app, all I have left is an overpriced tripod mount. Belkin PLEASE reach out to some of the leading camera apps and convince them to put a hook in their code to your hardware.

There are two bottons on the top for shooting pictures (a raised button), or shooting video (an adjacent smaller red button flush with the top of the grip).  The design of the grip is well thought out:  the top "wing" of the holder, is actually a bit concave, perfect for resting your thumb and keeping it off the screen.The things to like:Makes gripping the phone as a camera very easy and comfortable.The LiveAction App is free to download.Works with both forward and rear facing cameras.The App is intuitive:  it has a zoom, delay timer, flash setting (on, off, and auto), with a touch you can tell it where to focus.  It is very easy to transmit or upload photos once they are taken.The things not to like are:The buttons on the grip are a bit too far forward rather than directly over the phone, but you do get used to it.The Grip only works with the (Belkin) LiveAction App an cannot be used with the phone's regular camera functions or any other photo app.Pictures are not stored in your cameral roll, but in the "Gallery" of the app.The grip covers the charging socket and must be removed to charge the phone.Overall it is a nice little gadget if you want to use your phone as a dedicated camera.

As most people know, the iPhone 4s has a really good camera.The grip makes it easy to take still photos and videos.  There are separate buttons for each.I found the construction to be firm and the button response was very tactile.The thing I was not so keen on was the software that comes with it.  You are supposed to go to the app store and download a free live action app.  Then you put the gadget on.  Each time you want to use the camera grip you have to open the Live Action app, NOT the camera roll.  Bah.  Pressing the buttons on the camera grip when you are in the native camera mode does nothing.  This could be confusing if you hand someone your phone to take a picture, making you miss a good shot!  The good news is that when you plug in the grip the correct software opens automatically.  But its still less than desirable.This is a software/hardware combination, and you must use their software.  So, I feel its my responsibility to tell you some other shortcomings of the software.1) It puts all the pictures and videos in a "gallery".  This is a separate place, and the pictures you take go there instead of into your camera roll.  I don't like this.  I like all my stuff in one place.  You can tell it to save the stuff in your camera roll one by one.  What a pain.2) You can upload to Facebook directly from the camera app.  To do this, you must share your data with Belkin on Facebook.  I don't like this very much.  I guess its the only way.  Otherwise you would have to take the picture, transfer it to your camera roll, go into Facebook, and upload it.  Thats not much fun either.  So I allowed it to access Facebook, otherwise I can't really review it.  The first time I got an error.  The second time it tried to upload but took 5 minutes for one picture, and then it timed out.  I set it up to try a third time but I got a message that there was no internet connection (as if!).  So that feature seems to be broken.  Good thing that Belkin got permission to access my personal data up front!! (thats sarcasm)3) The timer should flash your iPhone 4 4s flash right before the picture takes, as a visual way to see that the picture is about to shoot.Anyway lots of room for improvement. I don't seem much need to go on.  You get the point.  The software is not very good.Overall I like using the device for taking photos.  I like the mount that it uses.  I think it would be great for snapping a lot of photos at theme parks, wedding receptions, or whatever.  But the implementation of the software leaves something to be desired...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review29" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-09:</strong> Based on an excellent idea, it could have proved to be far more useful, IF:- No need to use separate LiveAction app- Compatible with native camera pp and other photography apps.- Would have provided a locking mechanism to hold the cameraA lot of time, i strongly feel the need of such a grip, but the grip has to be universal and not just fixed to a crappy app like LiveAction.Belkin's app has no HDR support and does not saves pictures in photo album.Moreover while comparing images in exactly same lighting and scene condition, I found native camera app superior in image quality than LiveAction app.Digital zoo of LiveAction changes the frame & zoom level while taking picture!If Belkin's needs an interface to detect this grip, they could have come up with a simple app, which could recognize the hardware and automatically launch native camera app. Or to make it even better, they could have given an option to select your default camera app in settings (say Instagram) and launch that app automatically when grip gets connected.

It grips the phone better and can prevent the phone from slipping. It is also cool that you can basically turn the phone into a point and shoot camera by adding this.But I will point out a few drawbacks with my experience.1. With a defender otter box on the IPhone-a very popular case that protects the phone, you cannot use this gadget. I remove the outer rubber cover and then it fits.2.The user still has to be careful not to put fingers in front of the lens. The grip sits very close to the lens. This takes a conscious effort on the part of the user.3.When transferring the pictures to the camera roll to upload to your computer, the software only can transfer 5 at a time. This is a pain if you shoot a lot of pictures. It makes the process time consuming.I do like the small size of this. The concept is genius. When I attached the grip and it did not touch the sides of my phone completely, I thought it would not work, but it did. Plugging the grip into the IPhone's power source makes it work. The grip also fits into my purse easily.If Belkin can improve on the above, they would have a stellar product!UPDATE:As I stated above, when transferring to the camera roll, you can only do 5 at a time. But when I transferred and then went back to shooting, the device did not work. I had to restart my I Phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review31" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-24:</strong> It would be a reasonable idea to add this grip to the iPhone if it didn't then disable basic functionality like zooming in and out, as well as using the great new iPhone gesture to get to the camera from the locked screen.

I have always found the iPhone clunky when you are trying to take pictures...especially if you want to hold the phone steady. And maybe I just have fat fingers, but I am always inadvertently switching from photo-mode to video-mode. The Belkin Live action solves those problems and more. This is a must-have accessory for your iPhone if you plan on taking a lot of pictures. The Live Action Grip is comfortable, intuitive, and allows you to hold and operate the iphone like a camera. This easy, snap-on device moves the photo button to the top (and adds a new button for video) and allows you to have a firm, steady grip on the device at all times. And their free LiveAction app, which works with the accessory, simplifies the photo-taking process...and makes it even easier to send or post the pictures that you take. I love it. And so does my family. But it's easy for us to love -- we got it for free to review as an Amazon Vine member. At fifty bucks, the grip is way, way, WAY over-priced. What are they thinking? This should be a $15 item....and everybody with an iPhone would buy one. At least the App is free...!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review33" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-14:</strong> As a serious photo-hobbyist, I am intrigued by using the iPhone as a camera.  While image quality can't compare to that of my DLSR, numerous apps can be used to produce amazing creative photos especially for sharing on the web.  The Belkin LiveAction Camera Grip, made in China, mainly caught my attention because of the tripod mounting capabilities, but otherwise seemed gimmicky.The Belkin LiveAction Camera Grip, made in China, requires using the free LiveAction app available from the App Store.  Using spring loaded arms on the sides, the camera grip is case compatible, and attaches to the  charging end of a 30-pin connector iPhone.  Photo and video on/off buttons are located on the top end of the grip and a 1/4 inch tripod mount on the base.The LiveAction app interface provides limited setting options for photo/video. A flash button toggles between on, off and automatic, a timer button toggles between off, 5 seconds, and 10 seconds, and a camera button toggles between front and back camera lenses.  A small photo icon on the bottom right takes the user to the browsing section where a slideshow can be played, photos/videos can be deleted, or photos/videos can be shared to Facebook, sent by email, or saved to the Camera Roll.The best features of the Belkin LiveAction Camera Grip are the spring loaded arms and tripod mount.  Otherwise, shooting photos or videos are more trouble than using the iPhone camera app.  Photos are stored in a separate location from the camera roll as well, unless the user physically chooses to move them there.  The lack of integration and a troublesome app ruin the benefits of having an iPhone camera grip.If you're looking for a useful tool for taking photos and videos on your iPhone, the Belkin LiveAction camera grip is sure to disappoint.  Save your money and skip purchasing this product.PROS:1/4 inch tripod mount1 year warrantyCONS:Camera lag between pressing the button and the shot is takenLiveAction app continually freezes and reacts poorly to touchNot integrated with iPhone Camera system</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review34" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-16:</strong> I ordered this hoping it would be as easy to use as advertised.  A certain family member (cough - husband - cough) sometimes misses kodak moments and I had high hopes of this grip with app being able to help.  As it turns out, not so much.  Although this device was easy to use, it did not provide much more than what is already provided by your iPhone in the way of features.The Belkin camera grip is easy to plug into your iPhone and the app is quickly downloaded and installed.  The app is not complicated and although basic, is helpful but doesn't go much beyond free features already provided by Apple for your iPhone.  It provides an easy way to toggle between the photo and video buttons (iPhone has a sliding button between camera and red dot/video), allows you to instantly go from still to live shooting (also provided by iPhone screen) and makes it easy to share your photos and videos with social networks (this is pretty easy without using this app too).  I did like how the grip has a built-in tripod mount for any  standard tripod, very convenient.The only added benefit to this device is the comfortable camera grip that easily attaches to your iPhone.  The app itself provides much of the same features already provided by Apple for your iPhone (which is free).  I cannot recommend this device unless you have money to burn or willing to spend money for a comfortable grip.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review35" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-02:</strong> The use cases for the Belkin F8Z888tt iPhone LiveAction Camera grip are limited since it is a bit bulky, and requires that you launch a dedicated application on your iPhone.

The adjustable grip is nice and snug and easily held, however, it will not fit over an Otterbox and some other cases.  Only the thinnest case will allow it.  The video and camera buttons are easy enough feel and work; much better than simply taking the iPhone and holding it up (forward or reverse) as it helps keep your fingers out of the camera view.  There is a tripod mount which is convenient and Belkin does make a remote control feature accessory but oddly it does not fit with this accessory.For charging your device, you need to detach the handle.  It would be nice to have an extra input on the bottom so you could simply rest the entire phone and handle in a charger.Belkin does require the use of a free app which means you are limited by its proprietary software.  This means it is not compatible with other iPhone camera apps or functions.  Exporting to YouTube is more difficult as well.  It is a very good idea built I would wait until Belkin or Apple invent a similar device that is fully compatible with all camera applications and functions.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review38" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-22:</strong> It doesn't quite fit into your hand as well as they'd like you to believe.

It was round, firm and had a name written in ink on it: Fred. I bought Fred of off a kid down the street for a nickel because Fred was advertised as a fun and loyal companion. Fred was not. Fred didn't run, he didn't talk and I'm not convinced he was all that loyal. In fact, Fred was pretty useless- almost like a, well, a 5 cent rock.I've recently come into possession of the Belkin LiveAction Camera Grip with Application for Apple iPhone. I downloaded the app and messed with the hardware and feel the product is absolutely worthless. You attach the Belkin "camera handle stabilizer thingey" to the business end of your sleek iPhone 4, encumbering it to be more like a camera. Nevermind that some newer cameras are about as small as the attachment itself - but with the push of a button (or two) you can instantly snap some pics - just like a REAL camera! That is, if you've already had the attachment on your iPhone and you haven't snaped off the male end of the attachment when you sit with the phone and attachment in your pocket. Having to carry an extra accesory with you also renders the point of a small, sleek and mostly compact iPhone very moot.If, by chance you didn't have the Belkin Camera Kung Fu grip attached to your handy iPhone 4, it'll be much quicker to unlock your iPhone and call up the resident Camera app than fumbling with the gadget.The Belkin app itself is a wonder to behold. A line or two of code above bloatware. After taking pictures with the proprietary hardware and software, your pics have dissappeared into, yes- a Proprietary Gallery.  HOW AWESOME! Gallery is accessible only through the Belkin app itself. Suh-weet!Well, I could go on and on, blasting this product but it'd be like beating a dead horse.I still have the Belkin Camera Grip in my possession. I named it Fred and it sits on my shelf.

Belkin's LiveAction Camera Grip is perfect for both still shots and video.It allows me to fire off photos with a shutter button like my old digital camera. For videos, there is a tripod mount. Those two features alone make up for the minor inconvenience of having to use the Belkin LiveAction App, which actually is a decent one. I just wish it gave me the option of using whichever app I wanted. But a huge deal, though.It you are looking for an option that will allow you to leave your digital camera and videocamera at home, then the Belkin LiveAction Camera Grip is worth a shot.

Had I known this I would not have ordered it.For one thing I don't want to have to move the images I take using this product from where they automatically get sent to to where I want them, which is the Camera Roll, which is where all the other images are.  And I don't want to have to go through Belkin to upload images to a social media site.  I find the LiveAction software to be just generally not quite mature.On the plus side, the product does offer a standard metal tripod mount, which is the only reason I ordered it at all.  At least one reviewer already correctly noted that to use this product -- since you're not going to keep it attached to your device if you aren't using it as a camera grip -- you have to carry it around with you and then attach it to your camera before you can record images using it.  I just leave it attached to my tripod, since that's the only way in which I use it.So far I award three stars, because if I really need a tripod-mounted shot I can now have it.  But that's not much for the price of this product so I subtract one star, which means we're down to two.Now it's time to report on a few off-book tests I performed to see whether I should add or subtract any stars to arrive at the final rating.1. Although it latches nicely onto an iPod or iPhone 4, it does not latch at all well onto any of the following: a Droid Razr smartphone, a standard bowling ball, a hamster, a $6,900Leica M9 18MP Digital Range Finder Camera (Black, Body Only), the USS Nimitz CVN-68 aircraft carrier (not a camera), a Steinway Model D Concert grand piano (too big), and a slab of lime Jello-O in the shape and size of an iPhone 4 (WAY too squishy).  I didn't test other flavors.2. The Belkin LiveAction Camera Grip with Application for Apple iPhone 4s does not contain any radioactive elements or isotopes.  According to the USDA and the FDA and the EEUNSSHA you may use it while pregnant.  China does not object to it, which is where it's made.  Dan Quayle is not on record as objecting to it.  No animals are harmed in the testing of this product.  It is not prohibited on airplanes by the TSA.3. When shot through the heart with a .22 caliber bullet at ten yards, my particular example of this product flew into several pieces and is now both utterly unusable and also not, according to a very nice woman at Belkin named Beulah, covered by the warranty.#</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review42" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-30:</strong> I do like the fact that the grip does fit over a case if you have it on your ipod touch or iphone. The grip adjust so depending on what you are putting it on, the grip will fit. The grip does everything that it is suppose to do, the only thing is I think the record button could be a little bigger. Other than that the grip is cool if you take a lot of photos or video. It does a spot where you can hook it to a tripod, and a timer that you can set to off/5 secs/10 secs. The only compaint of the grip is that it is a bit ackward if you are not taking pictures. I would recommand only having it on your ipod touch or iphone if you are going to take pictures/video. The app that is free is a cute little program, but could be improved upon. It does have the feature of uploading the images to facebook, email, or save to your camera roll. Other than that and taking pictures, there is not much you can do with it. So there is room to improve.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review43" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-30:</strong> Never really worked properly with my iPhone and I never use it.

The problem is that in filling the need for a quick physical shutter button for the iPhone 4/4S, it makes the iPhone a completely clunky device.For starters, the device must be used in conjunction with a very basic camera app provided through the App Store by Belkin.  It basically replicates the built-in iPhone camera app's functions, but disables the on-screen button.  Belkin could have gone a step further and added some special filters, something, anything to make this stand out a bit.  But that's beside the point - it works just fine as it is, but you're stuck with that app and ONLY that app.  No using Camera+ or Instagram or, well, *anything*.Plug the grip into the iPhone via the dock charger and you find that it cradles that end of the iPhone perfectly, with self-sizing grips holding either side of the iPhone that will stretch out to accommodate a bumper or other similar-sized case.  Open the app and press the camera button, located closest to the speaker (that's the "right" grill opening on the bottom when holding the iPhone in portrait mode, or the "upper" grill in landscape.) It does indeed make taking a photo very quick and easy, with a confident little "snip" feel to the button.There are two routes you can go with the LiveAction Camera Grip - you either leave it on so you can take full advantage of it or mount it as needed.  Neither of these works all that well, however.  The grip is big and, as we know, the iPhone is long and slim.  Leaving it on makes it awkward to keep in a pocket, but the alternative is putting it on for every picture, then removing it, and keeping the grip somewhere.  It's just awkward, period.  A solution, it turns out, for what is really a very minor problem.And making things worse, Apple included shutter-button capability in iOS 5, so depressing the "up" volume button while the Camera app is open snaps a picture.  So, basically, this device becomes pointless, other than the plus of the built-in tripod mount - but then there are solutions to that out there, too (like thisStand with Mini Tripod Mount Adapter for iPhone 4G (Black).)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review45" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-02:</strong> I was excited to be able to try this grip with my iPhone 4s. Two things attracted me: 1. Tripod socket; 2. A "real" shutter button vs. the on screen or volume button release that is native to the iPhone. What I didn't realize was how bad the accompanying app is and that the hardware is incompatible with any other camera app for the iPhone.Pros:1. Very nice shutter button that allows for smoother shutter release that will reduce jitter.2. Rubbery surface on the grip that helps you hold the slim and slippery iPhone with more solid confidence.3. Metal tripod socket - not plastic - that allows you to use the LiveAction self timer function when mounting the iPhone on a tripod.*** the one plus the LiveAction camera app has is the self timer, btw.Cons:1. Weak, weak, weak, Live Action Camera app is required to operate with the grip.2. No support for the HDR capability of the iPhone 4s.3. No suport for any camera app other than LiveAction.4. No positive lock onto the iPhone with the grip connector. it's pretty much held on by friction.5. Expensive for this level of functionality.Conclusion:I gave it two stars because it is frustrating that something that has so much promise is left with lame software and a high price for what you get.

It makes the iPhone much easier to grip and take pictures with, and adds the ability to take timer pictures by using the tripod mount and software.  My only issue with the hardware is that I wish there was a zoom in and out button - you still have to use the touchscreen for that.  It does add some bulk to the phone (and to carry it around when not attached to the phone), but it makes picture-taking in certain situations significantly easier.As others have noted, the software is not the best.  However, I assume Belkin is working from hardware/software interface restrictions that do not permit the device to access the shutter function via the dock connector for Apple's camera app and other camera apps.  You can move images from the Belkin app to the camera roll manually (and then post process them with any number of apps - a bit of a wonky work-around, for sure), but my biggest frustration is that you can't do it automatically or in bulk - it's a one photo at a time process.  Hopefully these issues can be addressed in an update to the companion app.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review47" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-30:</strong> The LiveAction Grip works nicely to help you hold your iPhone for picture taking or movie making.

After taking a picture, when I go to see what I took, it was always upside down! I had to quit the app and restart to get it to work. It freezes up, or has a very slow response. There are no HDR settings to take a good picture. No features come with the app other than to take a picture with or without a flash, or a movie. No way to turn off the shutter sound so even though it lets you take a still while you are making a video, the shutter sound comes out on your video.

The idea behind the LiveAction Camera Grip is great - it gives your otherwise limited iPhone, "real" camera buttons and the ability to mount to a tripod. Who could ask for more? Well, for starters, people who like the large variety of camera apps for iOS will be disappointed, as this accessory only works with the Belkin App. This means you are unnecessarily limited in your options.The hardware is pretty decent - it clips onto your phone, and a spring loaded set of clamps keep it in place. In many ways it really does feel like you are holding a "real" camera. The tripod mount option is there - but in my experience, the whole setup wiggles around a bit too much.Sadly though, the biggest drawback is the price - $45 us just too much to ask for something this limited. Sure, if you absolutely must attach your iPhone to a tripod, and you absolutely must have hardware shutter, this will deliver and make you happy. Otherwise, just do what everyone else does, and use the screen or existing buttons.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review50" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-07:</strong> It is so rare that any camera-related iPhone accessory will accommodate a case - I'm just floored at how well this works.

With one hand, I can hold the phone, compose the shot and click the shutter release - all w/o touching the screen. The red button next to the shutter release is a quick toggle to the video mode. These hardware switches are SO MUCH FASTER than the software method of tapping the screen and waiting for a result.

I like that the side arms are spring-loaded and the clearance to the back of the grip is sufficient so that it would work with most bumpers and cases, unless you're an Otterbox fan.  When you insert the phone into the grip, the LiveAction app automatically opens.  As others have said, the buttons on this grip work only with that app and not any others.If the LiveAction app were good, then perhaps I wouldn't complain, but it has only the features of the standard Apple camera app and, in my experience, it froze twice when I tried tapping some of the on-screen options (such as flash, or when viewing the gallery.)  Worse, there was a noticeable delay between when I pressed the shutter button on the grip and when it took the picture.  With the standard camera app on an iPhone 4S, I measured the delay as about a quarter-second, whereas with the LiveAction grip and app, it was two seconds!  The app is also unresponsive to taps on its controls and it would often take me several tries to get an action to register.It is nice that it provides a tripod socket and if you are using it for movies, the shutter delay is probably inconsequential, but there are lots of "camera grips" for iPhones out there.  You could of course ignore the buttons and the LiveAction app and just use the standard app, or something like Camera+ or Filmic (both great), using the Belkin grip as just a grip. Otherwise, I'd recommend skipping this and looking elsewhere.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review52" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-09:</strong> The Belkin LiveAction Camera Grip is a gadget looking for a problem.

However, practically, there is little use for this accessory.The main issue is that you cannot use any sort of case when using the camera grip.  I don't know about you, but I like to keep my iPhone safely covered.  It also adds quite a bit of bulk to your iPhone.  The other limitation is that you are only able to use it with the Belkin app.  It would be much better if it worked with the native iPhone camera functionality.Bottom line, it isn't a game changer and will most likely get left at home.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review53" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-11:</strong> My finger does the same thing as this product. It hits the button. Sure, the phone is a little easier to hold but it also requires that I remove my case fully to put this on just to take a picture. It that worth doing? In my case (pun intended) I'd have to say, "no." Leave your case on and take the picture using your finger.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review54" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-16:</strong> I am not wowed by this.  The grip does make it easier to hold, but I am not likely to carry it around. Let's face it, The iPhone takes good video for a phone, but it's not a video camera.  I would be hard pressed to make this a must bring to any event.  There are many free or inexpensive apps that make this not a good value.  I think if it were not so expensive, I might recommend it more.  You are really paying (in my opinion) for the grip.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review55" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-23:</strong> This Belkin grip is a great idea for hardware, but is limited by its requirement for use with Belkin's propriety software.The hardware, the grip itself, is great. It's got a grippy rubberized feel, easy to use photo and video buttons, and a tripod socket. It fits perfectly on an iPhone 4/4S without a case, and very well on iPhones with cases because of its cleverly designed flexible clasps. I found that my iPhone4S with a Switcheasy brand case was slightly loose in the Belkin LiveAction Grip, but it still held it and I had no fears of it coming loose.The required app (free) that runs with the Belkin LiveAction grip however is less than impressive. I've had it crash once or twice, and freeze up once as well. Photos and videos taken with this app do not go directly to the iPhone photo library, but require a few extra steps (not entirely intuitive) to get them there. It's therefore a real shame that Belkin has hobbled a nice piece of hardware with its buggy and proprietary software. It would be much better if Belkin allowed this Grip to interface directly with the iPhone's fine photo and video app. If that happens I'll probably use this Belkin Grip a lot more.Until then, it's just as easy and more convenient for me to use my iPhone and the photo/video capabilities it already has. My iPhone case is almost as good a "grip" as the Belkin Live/Action Grip itself. Given the opportunity to use the Belkin Grip directly with Apples software however I would gladly use the Grip more.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review56" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-06:</strong> This is a pretty cool little add-on for the iphone 4.  I do not have to take my case off and it just clicks into the charge port on my iphone.  I can now take pictures or videos with a push of the button on top, just like a camera would have.  You can use the flash or flip the camera around for self-photos also, no more fumbling around trying to find the little camera button on the touch screen.  I can see my self using this for vacation or gatherings where I will be taking a lot of pictures.  Makes the Iphone easy to hold and use.  The price is a little steep (hence the 4 stars) but it is actually something that will be handy to have in my purse for when I want to take some pictures.  Also another downside is that you have to use their app when taking picures, but you can download those pictures to your camera roll.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review57" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-16:</strong> The iPhone 4s has a spectacular camera and this grip allows for better handling of the phone thereby giving you better pictures.The way it works: plug the grip into your dock connector, launch the Belkin LiveAction app (yes you need a app which is free in the app store), and take still images with a regularly sized black button or video with a smaller recessed red button.  Simple.  Once the pictures are taken they are stored in the app's memory...you can facebook them, email them, and or save them to the Camera Roll on the iPhone.  Perfect.If I had to have a gripe...it would be simply that the dock connector will only work without a case on your iPhone.  I naturally use a case as do most others and that may cause a problem....the case generally sticks out a bit and this would not fit perfectly.  I also wish the software automatically saved everything to the camera roll on the phone...perhaps they will include the option in a future update.What I like is the fact that I can pop this on to my iphone, launch the app, and take amazing pictures with a little more stability then I had with the phone alone.  The grip is quite comfortable.  I also like the fact that I can click the smaller red (recessed) button and start taking video immediately.It is an awesome product which enhances the picture taking experience on the iPHone 4s.  HIGHLY recommended.5/5</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review58" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-15:</strong> The Belkin Live Action Camera Grip is a device that makes it physically easier to use your iPhone or iPod as a camera, which I really like. It also uses a free, proprietary app, Belkin LiveAction, which I really don't like.The grip is one piece, and attaches firmly and securely with rubberized, spring-loaded side grips. Like many other i-devices, I cannot use it without removing my Otterbox Defender case from my iPhone 4S as that case is too large, but it does work with my iPod Touch in this case:Gummy Cover - Transparent Clear/Solid Black (S Shape) for Apple iPod Touch 4G. That is a plus because my 9 year old often uses my Touch and I am loathe to let him use it without any sort of protective case.There are 2 buttons which are conveniently placed. The large, slightly raised button operates the camera mode and it works wonderfully. Next to it is a small, red button that sits flush with the grip and operates video mode. People have mentioned it being too small but I like it. That way I don't accidentally activate video when I am trying to take a pic. There is also a place to attach a tri-pod.The big problem is that this grip works exclusively with Belkin's LiveAction app, which is quite limited. As long as you are content to keep your videos on your iPhone or iPod, it's OK, but you won't be able to export them to YouTube. It also puts your pictures in a different folder - not the native Camera Roll. This limits the multi-media aspects of your Apple device and who wants that? I see this as a deal-breaker.I am pretty happy with this grip for when my young son is in a photo taking mood because his pictures and video are less blurry and shaky when using it. But at $50 and the issues with the app, I can't recommend it for general use.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review59" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-13:</strong> I love the idea of a grip for the iPhone camera function. I take a lot of photos with my iPhone so I thought it would be helpful. The grip itself is great and fits over my snap-on case. (Huge plus for that!)But that's where my likes end...The app for the camera grip is horrible. The photos don't save to the camera roll on the iPhone. Also the quality of the photos appear to me to be diminished. I prefer my Camera+ app or even Instagram over the Belkin app. And for quality, I'm going to stick with the iPhone's built in camera.Overall...not worth it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review60" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-13:</strong> I love this grip for the iPhone. It makes handling the phone to take pictures much easier and fit around my silicon iPhone case with no problem. That's what I loved about this product. If I could use this grip without having to use the Belkin LiveAction Camera App it would be perfect, but alas, that's not the case. As soon as you plug the grip into the phone it automatically opens the app. I prefer the built in camera app or Instagram for taking photos. If I was tech savvy enough to find a way to disable the app and continue using the grip I would but so far I haven't found a way to do so.I'm giving this gadget 3 stars because the app isn't very good compared to other camera apps for the iPhone but the grip is very ergonomic and a huge improvement on just trying to hold the slender iPhone steady when taking a shot.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review61" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-17:</strong> Yes this holder is made to grip and use your iphone to manipulate picture taking.It is functional and clean in design.I for one am not someone who will make this object a priority,as I am a more spontaneous type of character.

The recent ios 5 software upgrade on your iPhone just does that - once you have upgraded the operating on your iPhone - just launch the iPhone Camera App, click on the volume button on your iPhone (instead of clicking on the screen) to take pictures !!  No need for any additional software or hardwareA couple of other points about this device:* Like all belkin products - it is very well done hardware : nicely crafted, built to last* As soon as you plug in the device, iPhone launches the App Store to download the free software which will be used along with this hardware* The pictures taken with this device/software does not get stored in the same folder/vault as the default iPhone app* fits over your iPhone case effortlessly* There are 2 buttons on the device - one for stills and one for videos- The button for video is very misleading: it looks like a button for flash on/offOverall - I would not buy this device given the fact that the ios 5 upgrades makes the iPhone usable just like a pocket camera.  Belkin - if you are reading this - add an additional zoom lens & a flash and I would definitely buy it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G606O8" id="B005G606O8-review63" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-04:</strong> This is a pretty handy little accessory if you find yourself constantly taking pictures or video with your iPhone and having trouble holding the phone steady (particularly for video). The grip is small enough to not get in the way (and it expands to handle chunkier cases) but still gives you more of a handle to grasp your phone with. I found it much more helpful for video than photo.Installing the software is super easy - the first time you connect the device your phone automatically connects to the app store and downloads the app. The app is basically the same as the built-in iPhone camera app, except that you don't have to choose video or camera, you just press the appropriate button (there's a camera button and a video button, which is convenient). A big drawback to me is that the videos/images you capture in this app don't automatically populate into the regular folder. You can export them there but that's an additional step that shouldn't be necessary.This device has a spot to screw into a tripod but I haven't tried it with a tripod.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B005G606O8', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B005G606O8', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B004WMDJX2</h2>    <p class="price"> $B004WMDJX2</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

My research came up with few stand and for the price of this ezeStand, I can accept if it turns out to be a bast. To my surprise the ezeStand in my opinion is equal or much better than Motorola stand sold by Verizon. My DroidX don't get power through ezeStand, it stand higher and the phone is almost at right angle easy to see, well padded top to bottom, sturdy black plastic construction. I also bought with it a right angle micro USB to stand USB, it's a perfect match as I don't want my cable to bend in an awkward position from below. I am happy with my decision while the Motorola stand have complain regarding charging phone.This stand will take vertical and horizontal position. There's no problem on the horizontal position as it an open stand, however, my Droid X having a shell for protection won't fit between the front post for a vertical position. Since my purpose for the stand is for the Droid X to act as a desk clock there's no problem there, even if I wanted to play music or look at pictures, video, movies, read emails, all works on a horizontal position. The vertical position for me is good for looking at menu pages while on the stand because the orientation don't shift to a landscape position. Since Droid X is a larger and wider smartphone, smaller smartphones will have no problem.

Most of the protectors I've ordered had that problem of not fitting correctly. The down side is that I did not know it would have a texture on them and have a gritty looking effect on it.

The 12-Pack of Microfiber Cleaning Cloths is one of the best purchases I have made in a long time since we are gadget heavy family (multiple Kindles, Smart Phones, iPod Touches, etc) and we also all wear glasses. It seems that there was never a clean, safe for glasses, cleaning cloth around when we needed them, but with 12 of these we have placed them in the cases with our Kindle Fires, in the glove box of our cars, in the desks at our small business, and in my wife's and daughter's purses.The wipes are fairly small (roughly 3" x 6"), but certainly large enough to be effective on all of the surfaces we need to clean. The see-through plastic pouches are handy for keeping the cloths clean from "pocket lint" and also lets us see the color since everyone has claimed a couple for their own use (with the four black ones being "community").I am very pleased with these and will likely buy another pack once these start to wear out or get misplaced.Highly Recommended!CFH</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DM8428S" id="B00DM8428S-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-25:</strong> These were packaged in their own individual sleeves which was nice.

Also, note that 3-conductor is for stereo headsets. 4-conductor is what you will need if using as a phone headset/microphone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000LMBJMA" id="B000LMBJMA-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-12:</strong> I bought these as in more than 1 thinking they would work on my home cordless phones and they did not as in you can hear the person on the other end but they cant hear you talk :(.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000LMBJMA" id="B000LMBJMA-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-24:</strong> Bought this because I recently got an LG Octane cell that I love except for the 2.5mm headset plug.  I use a wired headset with a boom mic at work due to background noise causing too much interference with the mic on my Bluetooth headset.  Headset has 3.5mm plug.  Bought this to use the headset with the LG.  While I can hear the caller with both ears, the MIC does not work!  I had another adaptor I had used with an earlier LG, and it had the same problem, but hoped this would work based on the (admittedly vague) description and a review specifically stating it worked with the Octane.  Apparently, that reviewer only wanted it for music, even though that's not what he stated.  Anyway, the same headset worked fine in a Motorola Droid RAZR with a built in 3.5mm jack.  I knew this was a crapshoot.  I lost.  Hope to keep others from repeating my mistake.Also, the adaptor I got is white- the pictures of it vary depending on how you search for it, and change from the item description to the picture in your shopping cart.  This is a pretty sketchy listing for Amazon.  Wasn't sure what I was getting, and didn't get what I expected.  Oh, well.  Only $3 wasted.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000LMBJMA" id="B000LMBJMA-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-15:</strong> I bought this product for a former phone I had.

Build quality and price are the two big issues I tend to focus on because frankly, what more can you really say about this type of thing?The Kensington has great build quality and it works as promised.  It's a good choice for charging iPhones and other devices using the included 30-pin connector.  If you have a device-specific cord, it works with many others as well.Product Features: (per Amazon):1.

The battery life on the phone goes quick, so needs regular charging.  While I read some mixed reviews on the 2.1A port working on other devices, I decided to try it as it still had the 1A port available to use if need be (which is more than the default Samsung wall charger at 700mA).  I was pleasantly surprised to find that both ports work quite well with the Galaxy S2, and it seems to charge quickly.  This charger is slim, and unobtrusive, so can stay in place for normal use.For some newer cars, they leave the accessory jack powered with the car off, but the LED on the charger lets you know if it's still drawing power so you know if you need to unplug it or not.  For mine, I can just leave it plugged in all the time, so your mileage may vary.Overall I'm VERY happy with this charger, and glad that I didn't let the warnings discourage me.  However, if you don't have an iPhone/iPad/etc., you will end up with an extra cord that serves no purpose.  But other than that it's a great deal.  And much quieter (silent) than the combo inverter/USB charger I had previously.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003PU01M4" id="B003PU01M4-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-02:</strong> this item can charge both my iphone and my ipad im not certain if it can do both at the same time because it only came with one charge cord.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003PU01M4" id="B003PU01M4-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-27:</strong> they could do better on the length and cord quality. but 1 year no problems .

The USB plugs into the base tightly also.  The cable that's included seems to be the &#34;normal&#34; length.  The end that plugs into the iPhone fits nicely also (both the 4 and 4S).  Too bad that it's designed to charge _two_ things at a time but only comes with _one_ cable (4 out of 5 for this reason).

I mounted the iPad on the headrest and plugged it into the 2.1A slot, threw my iPhone into the console and plugged it into the 1A slot, and neither device missed a beat.  The charger worked perfectly, and continues to work almost 5 months later.  I leave the charger plugged in all the time, and use it to charge the iPad, iPhone, iPad bluetooth keyboard, wife's Blackberry, and other devices.The build quality is on par with similar devices - I wouldn't want to drop it, but most of these things feel like they're built from somewhat flimsy material.

I saw this PowerBolt Duo and I like the fact that it will charge our iPhones, iPods, and our iPad 2. That is because it has the capability to charge at 2.1 amps which is a requirement for the iPad 2 and 3 and it has a second port that output 1 amp that is ideal for my Apple iPhone. You can use it on your iPhone and iPad at the same time.I like the fact that the device has an LED that indicates that it is getting power and that it is low profile so it doesn't take up a lot of space and it is not easy to bump. I also like that charger cable that goes to your Apple device has a standard USB connector on the end that plugs into the car charger plug. This means that you can use the cable that came with your Apple device if you need to.  It does come with an Apple 30 pin connector cable that unplugs and I can plug in my Apple iPad Air lightning cable and charge it also.One disadvantage that may sound silly is one that I also mentioned as an advantage. The charger is so "low profile" that once it is plugged in to the car charger socket, it is difficult to unplug. It is literally almost flush with the top of the charger socket in my vehicle. You can barely get a finger nail on it to slowly pry it out. Overall I like the charger and it serves a multipurpose function for many of our Apple toys.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003PU01M4" id="B003PU01M4-review43" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-20:</strong> This is fairly compact and it worked reliably for almost a year before it failed (on a trip unfortunately).

It gets 3-stars because all it claims to support is Apple devices.Now for more details...A little background on USB charging for those who don't know:The USB power spec is for 0.5 Amps at 5 Volts... or 2.5 Watts.  This was great up until the last couple years when devices have gotten really power hungry, particularly smartphones and tablets and to a lesser extent dedicated GPS's.  Some of these devices use over 2 Amps, particularly the tablets like the iPad (or in my case the HP Touchpad).Manufacturers of these devices therefore had a dilemma.  If they had their devices pull more than 0.5 Amps, they risked damaging the power source, which could be a computer, that was only prepared to source 0.5 Amps.  Thus the manufacturers have used tricks to determine whether their device is connected to an unknown source, at which point they purposely only draw 0.5 Amps, or to the dedicated charger that was provided with the device, where they can draw all the power they need.There seem to be two common tricks used.  The first is to short the two data-wires together in the charger.  This is what most non-Apple devices do.  Since a computer or older device wouldn't have done this, the device can assume it is safe to draw all the power it needs.Apple seems to have taken a different approach, one that I don't fully understand but know can be seen by the fact that the data lines are neither open nor shorted when the charger is plugged in, and is more sophisticated and probably superior, because I suspect it allows the device to know exactly how much power it can use.While Apple taking a better approach might be nice in concept, it's created chaos in the USB charger product category.  What is the non-specific charger to do?  They can't support both.Kensington chose to go the Apple route for the 2.1 Amp port.  I don't own any high-power Apple devices, so I can't say for sure, but I suspect this unit performs well with Apple devices.  Using electronic equipment I was able to draw 2.1 Amps when putting a fixed load on this USB charging port.  However, when I connect any of the 3 high-power devices I have (HP Touchpad (2 Amps), Motorola Triumph Android phone (0.85 Amps) and the LG Optimus Slider (0.7 Amps)), none of them drew all the current they could have, because they were expecting a shorted set of data-lines.The 1 Amp port on this device is a bit of a quandry however.  It didn't have the signature on the data lines of either the Apple protocol or the shorted lines.  It appeared to have them open... which was a surprise and I believe a mistake (although I can't be certain with Apple products).  The results for my 3 devices however were identical to that of the 2.1 Amp port.To highlight the positives, I can say this, I was able to draw all the power the product claims it can source using fixed loads.  As my above explanation makes clear, it is the DEVICE, not the charger, that chooses not to make full use of the available current (Amps).  So by using power resistors I could test the actual capacity of the device without dealing with the data-line issue.As such, I was able to draw both 2.1 Amps from one port and 1 Amp from the other, simultaneously.  I can not say the same for the other charger I have tried (and I have two in shipment to test).Thus this device gets 3 stars because it only claims to support Apple devices and without any to test I have to assume it would work great for them.  It also can deliver the current it claims.  It is likely a 5-star product for sole apple users.However, for non-Apple users, I STRONGLY encourage you to look elsewhere for your Car USB power needs.  The other device I've tried is the "PowerGen Dual USB 2A Heavy Duty Ouput Car Charger" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00622AG6S/ref=oh_o05_s00_i00_details).  It has other problems (the 2A port doesn't have the data lines shorted and it only sources a TOTAL of 2A, not 2A on one port and 1A on the other), but at least one port (the 1A, which can really do 2A by itself, see my review over there for more details on that) on that has the data lines shorted to get the full power with non-Apple devices.I've ordered two additional devices:- "Ultra Compact High Output Dual USB Car Charger - 2.1A Output" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00470C35E/ref=oh_o01_s00_i00_details)- "Bracketron Universal Dual USB Car Adapter (UGC-298-BL)" (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0056VNVV8/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_details)Hopefully one of the two of them will be able to deliver to their specs for my devices.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003PU01M4" id="B003PU01M4-review48" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-05:</strong> This broke after less than 1 month and only a few uses (I bought this one for my 2nd power outlet to charge the ipad when needed on trips).

I tried to look on the Kensington website for info but there is no email so I guess I'll have to call them to see if maybe they will exchange it.  It was great the few times we were able to use it.  My husband bought some cheap chinese knock off for his car for a few bucks and it works great.  I also have a Motorola charger that works well but doesn't have the juice to power an ipad.

My Droid charges normally on the lower 1A port and provides the same charging time as the original Motorola charger Verizon provided with my original Droid.The other part about this charger I really like is the fact that the USB cords provided with the charger fit snugly in to the charging ports. This is good, considering how much the vehicles I am vibrate and get jostled on the road. The one thing I did notice abou the Kensington-provided iPhone/iPad charger is it did not have the releases on the sides of the Apple connector just as the OEM connectors do. I have not had an issue with things popping out, but the original white OEM USB chargers would work well in place of the black Kensington cable and connectors.I've looked for a long time for the right charger at the right price and this certainly seems to be it.

Don't get me wrong it IS clearly marked on the front face but if you are an avid traveler renting various types of cars you'll know that some of the DC adapter outlets are located inside armrest consoles, tucked in the lowest parts of the center consoles in the front or back seating areas depending upon make/model/year of the car. These outlets can obscure the front face and it makes it hard to see which port is the 2.1 and 1 amp, especially at night. I use the 3 vent holes on the one side to establish the orientation and mentally remember that that is the side of the 1 amp port. If you want a better visual reference you could always do it yourself by marking one of the sides with a bright sticker, nail polish, etc.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003PU01M4" id="B003PU01M4-review61" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-16:</strong> This unit has been great.  can charge two units together which is great for car trips with my wife, can charge both of our iphones together.  very dependable and have had no problems in many months of usage.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003PU01M4" id="B003PU01M4-review62" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-24:</strong> I know Amazon prices fluctuate far more rapidly and widely than other online retailers. but the tale of this charger is whackier than most:On December 7, 2012, I see this for $9.99 here on Amazon and order TWO. It's a no brainer! Kensington at "no-name" pricing, dual power slots at "single slot" pricing, 10 watts at 5 watt pricing. It's sold direct by Amazon, not by a 3rd party vendor closing out on over-stock.Did I mention it came with an original style cable, which seems sturdier than the Apple which is prone to fraying at the juncture with the connectors themselves?So I dutifully come back here on December 24, 2012,  to review it, and suddenly it is $24.96! Not a buck or two more expensive, almost THREE TIMES as expensive.Now at $9.99, that's a cheap price for a name-brand cable, let alone for a dual slot power supply, with one of them delivering the full 10 watts preferred by the old iPad 3. But at $24.96 the decision is much tougher - go with this one, or with a no-name for half the price? Do I really need an extra cable (at this higher price), or would a no-name without a cable be ok? What about a no-name that is reviewed as being able to deliver 10 watts but only if the other slot is unused? What about a no-name that can only deliver 5 watts, enough for my phone but not for an iPad? See, I got the first class, feature-rich charger, WITH cable, for a stripped, generic device price. Yay! But - why the pricing difference? Is it still worth it?See, products don't have "absolute" value. They have value relative to their price.The new model of online pricing - varying prices daily, or even hourly - is making it really hard to shop.This isn't limited to Amazon, the NY Times did an article this holiday season about how Target, Best Buy, and WalMart, among others, varied prices day by day this holiday season, post-Black Friday, to match or beat their competition, and which store had the most consistently low prices - which wasn't consistent across all products. I just read an article that another retailer, Staples, even delivers different online pricing depending on your zip code and nearness to one of their identified competitors, like Office Depot.So this review is a little different from my other product reviews, and different from the other product reviews of this particular product.For the best insights on performance of this product, read the two top-rated reviews here - I believe those two are honest, objective, and insightful. The only thing I would add, is that I have three Apple cables that are frayed at the junction with the actual connector - the flex portion wasn't well-designed. From the looks of it, the flex portion on the Kensington cable is longer and thicker - which should extend the cable life at this critical juncture where more stresses occur. The first top rated reviewer has actually used this for over two years and reports that, yes, the Kensington included cable does last longer, so that is a nice bonus. Secondly, and don't laugh, now that Apple has released the new Lightning Connector, I like the fact that Kensington departed from "Apple white" to make their connector in black - why? - because it's a lot quicker to grab the right device cable when black means old style and white means Lightning. Yes, this comes up, since I have devices with both styles of connectors and travel with both. It's just one less thing to be annoyed by, when trying to charge them.In terms of pricing strategies, good grief, stay on your toes! Amazon USUALLY has very competitive prices, if not the best, but now more than ever it pays to comparison shop, even to open an "Incognito" browser tabe in Chrome to see if searching cookie-free returns different pricing. Above all, comparison shop, and if you don't like the prices today, bide your time, and post buying, monitor the prices for the first month so you can ask for a price adjustment if things get out of whack.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003PU01M4" id="B003PU01M4-review63" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-27:</strong> This thing is perfect. Not only can you charge an iPad at full power with the thing, but the secondary port outputs 1A which will charge your phone faster than usual. In some cases the typical 0.5A charger (which might not even be outputting a full 0.5A) can't even supply enough power to my phone to both satisfy its power consumption and charge the battery if the phone is running the GPS, playing music, doing bluetooth, keeping the screen on, and other stuff that causes it to consume lots of energy.While this thing is more expensive than the cheapo adapters out there, it's well worth the cost. Having your devices too low on power when you get out of the car is really not fun, especially when they're drained before you can even make it back to the car. Two high power USB ports in one cigar outlet is a major advantage because most people don't have more than one or maybe two cigar outlets in their car. Even if you don't normally need two USB power ports, trust me... you will be happy you have the extra one day when you do need to plug something else in. And eventually you will.Buy a cheap adapter for $5 or something and one day the extra $15 you should have spent will feel like nothing when your battery is dead in some critical situation.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003PU01M4" id="B003PU01M4-review64" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-29:</strong> I've tried nearly a dozen car chargers for my ipod touch.

The voltage varies on the two ports, but I don't quite remember the stats off the top of my head. The IPhone port will take longer to charge, whereas the IPad port will charge considerably faster but may cause wear on your battery with extended use. I still use mine, it's cheap and useful in those trips where both me and my buddy want to charge our devices. Kensington is a good brand for mobile accessories.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003PU01M4" id="B003PU01M4-review72" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-02:</strong> This really solved a problem for me when I changed my phone to the 5s and suffered the problem of the lightening tip being different from the old cable tip and my iPad still needing the old tip.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003PU01M4" id="B003PU01M4-review73" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-29:</strong> This charger works and comes with an extra cable, which is great if you charge your phone from multiple locations.

Even with Zagg Skin applied to the phone, it still fit in very nicely. A little snug but fit well. The suction mount works very good and been staying there for a month now. The audio cable that comes with the package does not work very good. The quality of the cable is cheaply made and a lot of static noise. I switched back to my old cable and works great.Since Android phone battery doesn't last long, this navigator mount is a great charger when I get into the car. Nowadays, I don't have to worry about bring my Garmin GPS with me since the Motorola Droid 2 phone's navigator works just as good.Also, this exact mount sells a whole lot more a Verizon store.

I'd never heard of this company before but was really impressed with what I read about their products.  I mean, a GLASS screen protector??  How cool would that be? I always like to have unique stuff for my phone.  Arrived quickly I will admit, but the instructions for installation are slim to none.  I washed my hands, cleaned the table, cleaned the phone screen and placed the protector on the phone.  I figured application of this was the same as the flimsy plastic screen protectors I've always had.  The center attached well, but I had a long air pocket on the very edges of both sides.  I tried to smooth them out with the plastic card they supplied, but it was too much.  I now have a nasty chip on the right edge of the protector which slowly but surely spread into a nice crack running down to the left bottom corner.  So frustrated!  So now that I'm considering another one (I must be crazy) in perhaps a thicker model, I saw a video about the protector.  I assumed before it was a sales pitch and hadn't watched it.  In the first 5 seconds of the video it quickly shows a protector being placed on a phone and SIMPLY USING ONE FINGER to touch the middle of the protector to begin the attachment process.  Well hello!!!!  It would have been really super great if they had included that in the instructions.  Now mine is ruined and I'm sure it's only a matter of time before the crack turns into a break.  I'm sure the product is good even though I've had it installed for a few hours.  The look is awesome, keeps the screen beautifully bright and you really cannot tell it even has a protector on it.  The 2 stars is for lack of information to the consumer on proper installation in the packaging.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BL5FBFW" id="B00BL5FBFW-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-21:</strong> I've recently looked into tempered glass protectors. I first tried iloome's flexible glass. For it's price if you're looking for a very thin tempered glass screen shield I highly recommend it. But it was kind of difficult to install like any protector, and I don't know if it was just my protector but it always had fingerprints and picked up oils quickly.I decided to change it and go with the Glas.tR. Packaging wise, its great. Comes in a nice casing that can be used to store extra shields and such. For the price I paid of $21, it was a good deal, 1 glass shield, a back protector, alocohol pad for cleaning oil off the screen prior install, 6 mini gel home buttons (for the iPhone 5 and below) and a mini micro fiber wipe.To pull off the &#34;perfect&#34; install I ran the shower in hot water to steam the bathroom to allow dust and hair to fall due to moisture. This actually HELPED a lot. There was no dust, hair, or lint after wiping down the phone. I suggest when you pull off the adhesive of the protector have it faced down just in case if any dust or hair fall on the adhesive side. I slowly aligned the protector and laid it on the phone lightly. From here I used my nail to push and align it. Once I aligned it perfectly I applied pressure in the center and it applied on by itself. I used my thumb to push out any bubbles. I started to get tiny bubbles on the corners and it wasn't dust but after 10 minutes or so I pushed them out. But as the instructions mention, tiny bubbles would take a a few hrs or a day to go away.Overall great product! Hardly any fingerprints catch on and if any they are easy to wipe off. The protector feels like glass and imo better than the actually phone. The curved edges seem to be case friendly. It worked with my Speck pixel HD, but I am currently using spigens Neo Hybrid in champagne.This product is a go!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BL5FBFW" id="B00BL5FBFW-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-14:</strong> i love this screen protector. you can't even tell that it is on the phone. it's so thin and lite. they even made one for the back. now they need to make these for the galaxy note 10.1 2014 edition as well...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BL5FBFW" id="B00BL5FBFW-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-08:</strong> The feel of glass on the screen is great.  It does not dampen the sensitivity or cause you to use more force.  You must be careful with the initial placement as it is very difficult to take it off and reapply it if you get it wrong.

I have yet to have one on two different iPhones.Better value and hassle:  One glass protector will outlast 10 plastic screen protectors.  Less work to replace bc of this.Cons:As will all screen protectors, you need to understand how best to install them to avoid dust and particles from getting between the phone screen and the screen protector.  Glass or plastics have yet to master these.  The good thing is, these are slightly easier to install IMO, but still a pill, therefore resulting in a &#34;con&#34;.Because this is glass, it may affect different cases.  As an example, this does not affect any open-faced case.  That being said, the thickness seems to affect my waterproof case.  The thickness seems to affect it's snug fit.  If you don't plan on wrapping your whole iPhone in a waterproof case, you should be fine.Overall, this is a wonderful product if you can get past the installation process.  This still gets 5-stars, because all these products suffer from this.  Skip the cheaper plastic screen protectors and upgrade to the glass.  You won't regret it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BL5FBFW" id="B00BL5FBFW-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-22:</strong> This screen protector is amazing.

Also expensive, but very well-made they bring the level of your home button up to the level of the GLAS.t.  Otherwise, you're left with divot at the home button.  Spigen exhibits incredible attention to detail in these products.EDIT:  Within two weeks of purchasing, the screen protector developed a quite noticeable chip along the top edge.  This despite the fact that I am careful to keep my phone in my front pants pocket without anything else that could scratch it.  When I emailed Spigen about this, they never responded.

The reason I like them so much is because when installed they feel just like the glass that they are covering to protect.  Unlike plastic covers, these are real glass so your fingers glide smoothly over their surface.  I have used plastic screen protectors in the past and my fingers did not glide smoothly and using a stylus was nearly impossible.  The glass can be rather fragile - it will break if you hit something, but it breaks so that your screen below doesn't.

I have a Spigen Tough Armor case, so I knew that it would at least be decent quality. The biggest issue I have with aftermarket screen protectors is even with oleophobic coatings (prevents oily build-up) my screen protectors would still become oily pretty quickly just due to my natural body type.Upon receiving this, I installed it per the instructions. I didn't have to straighten it quite as much because the Spigen case helped line it up perfectly. I typically takes my protectors to Bestbuy or the like for installation because of air bubbles, but this was a breeze! I only have a single big bubble after the install, and the squeegee easily got rid of it.Overall, the products impressed me. I'm not sure what type of oleophobic coating it has, but it does the job very well. I've had a Spigen film in the past that didn't even work, but this is incredible. It doesn't detract from the IPhone's display a single bit, it shines through and almost enhances it. I've very lightly hit screw drivers and keys against it, and it's caused no damage, which is especially useful if I need to put screws/keys/etc in my pocket with the phone.In summary, I would recommend this without a doubt. I would pay double the price for this product having tried one now.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BL5FBFW" id="B00BL5FBFW-review53" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-24:</strong> Nice product...well recommend.

I expected the glass to be pretty tough, especially since it cost more than double what a screen protector would cost, however I was mistaken. Simply by holding my keys and iPhone in the same hand, I was able to crack the glass - something that took little to no force.

Application however is a one shot deal and though i made every effort of do it right dust messed it up.Yes I it after I steamed out my shower, and yes I made every effort to clean the screen. The alcoholic swab was very helpful. However using the brand new microfiber cloth they gave me was a mistake.Wipe one dust and another appears next to it. I took awhile and did my best to make sure the screen was clear and it was. Alignment went great and everything was perfect until I see a huge bubble just above the screen on the white area. In the center of that bubble is a fat withe fiber from the cloth. The bubble wont go way and its undoing the adhesive growing bigger. I have to keep pressing on the spot to reduce its size.My advice is don't use the cloth and be 200% sure the screen is clean. 100% isn't enough.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BL5FBFW" id="B00BL5FBFW-review57" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-18:</strong> I really liked this product, the look and feel of it was great for the first week.

It does have a very thin line from the molding process that I have read to be irritating, but after a couple months it has smoothed out and before, it never bothered me anyway.

I have replaced 2 cracked screens from the phone being dropped only a few feet and hitting the top or bottom of the device. I have dropped this phone many, many times on its own without a case but with this tight case on the phone it seems to cause additional stress on the sides of the glass. It did not take very much to completely shatter my screen when dropped on a linoleum floor in our kitchen from counter-height. The other screen was broken when dropped on concrete after sliding off my wife's lap when she got out of her civic.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EPLTC1I" id="B00EPLTC1I-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-17:</strong> Much better than google's case for nexus 5.

This is the one.  It weighs only 12g, protects the camera lens, and has a similar texture to the Nexus 5.  it's only 1mm thick!  With regard to the sharp bottom edge people complain about, it's easily fixed.  A gentle filing with a fine triangular or jeweler's file (or probably even a fingernail file) will take off that bottom edge.  This seems to be a remnant of the molding/manufacture process.  I also had to smooth the bottom of the volume rocker cutout.  But for $8, it's a worthwhile tradeoff.I've discovered that with this case attached, it works well with the Seidio Surface holster.  It's only slightly loose in the holster, but won't come out accidentally.  About a 3/8&#34; length of 3/4&#34; diameter shrink tubing around the holster's top clip fixes the looseness and makes a perfect fit.  The shrink tubing can be found at any electronics store for about $2.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EPLTC1I" id="B00EPLTC1I-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-17:</strong> The case is very slim and sleak, but it doesn't really put my mind at ease in terms of the protection it offers.

It is harder than  it should be to take the phone out of the case.The headphone hole is too small for the headphone jack of my Audio-Technica ATH-M30 to fit into.

Well I was very wrong.  Please trust me when I say that this case is not properly made.  It's nice that it has such a tight and slim fit, but if you take it off, you will ruin your phone.  I put it on, and literally the very first time I removed the case, all four corners of my Nexus 5 got scuffed and damaged.  The case is too tight, so when you attempt to remove it, you will damage your phone.  I have had many slim fitting and tight cases in my past, but none have ever ruined my phone when attempting to remove it.Very upset about this.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EPLTC1I" id="B00EPLTC1I-review33" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-15:</strong> This case is slim.  It is what the word was intended to describe. Unlike the rest of the cases I've tried that claim to be slim, this one really is. It's barely there and it's exactly what a slim case should be.  It offers minimal protection, but you have to expect that when you want a truly slim case that you can slip into your pocket and not have a giant bulge.This case is the bare minimum of what a case can be, it offers unprotected access to all the buttons, so no more of the mush did-I-press-it? feeling with other cases. It also allows unfettered access to the USB charger, which is nice.  The one drawback is that it has some surrounds that block access to the headphone jack if you have a headphone connector that has a thick border.  Other than that, this case is perfect for a slim case.  It does not affect edge-to-edge screen protectors, yet provides scratch resistance as well as very basic drop resistance for your phone.  It probably would not protect your screen from cracking if it hits just right, but that's the price you pay for having a slim case.Over all, it seems to be quite a fine product and described correctly in the title.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EPLTC1I" id="B00EPLTC1I-review34" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-12:</strong> I really like this case, a lot. It's _thin_ and does it's job well. My n5 with the caseology tpu hybrid case felt like a mess. But this feels so much better.TIP: Another reviewer noted the sharp edges around the edges of the case obviously from the manufacturing process.  This is the ONLY reason I'm giving this 4 stars. That should have been cleaned up at the factory at some point.However doing let that stop you from buying the case. It's nothing a little shaving with an exacto knife, razor blade, or fine grit sand paper wouldn't fix. Just make sure to do it BEFORE you out the case on, otherwise you'll never get it off. It's that tight :-)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EPLTC1I" id="B00EPLTC1I-review35" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-08:</strong> When I got my new Nexus 5 I went case crazy - a girl likes options.

Sure nobody loves bulk, but it's minimal - which can be a downside if you're looking for serious protection - this isn't the case for that.  The corner protection instills confidence.  The raised ridges in front are just enough to make you feel some &#34;lay flat on its face&#34; protection but not enough to interrupt the look or feel of the phone.This is the case for those of us that baby our phones already but want that extra protection from an occasional small drop.  You know the kind where your phone slips, and your Call of Duty reflexes catch it... almost... and it goes tumbling at an angle due to your near-save attempt instead of straight towards the floor?  Yea, you know what I'm talking about.. With this case it'll tumble and clatter but likely will be OK.My only complaint is the earplug hole is a little small, some of my earphone jacks take extra work to get a connection.

I love how slim it is, you can wirelessly charge through it, and the way it still lets the design of the Nexus 5 shine through--especially the matte black that I purchased.It is certainly not a bulletproof case by any means, but I can say it protected my nexus just fine as a result of a topple to the asphalt in a parking lot with minimal cosmetic scuffing to the case itself. I also had a screen protector on it (and glad I did!) which got a couple of little bubbles in it from the asphalt but my screen and phone are absolutely fine.I can't say I have had any issues with a sharp edge--and I've got pretty small girl hands, so if it was there (at least on my unit) I guarantee it'd be digging into my hand as I try to stretch from one edge to the other.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EPLTC1I" id="B00EPLTC1I-review41" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-09:</strong> what attracted me the most from this case was the slim design and I did in fact use it for about 2 weeks.

This defeats the whole purpose of getting the case in the first place.- The cutout for the headphone port is too small. Smaller earbuds are fine, but larger headphones like Audio Technica ATH-M50 or Sony MDR-V6 can't be plugged in all the way.- BIGGEST ISSUE: for some unknown reason, after about 2 weeks with the case on all the time, today I took it off to try on another case (BearMotion sand), lo and behold, the four corners of my phone are SCRATCHED UP!

But I cannot use it for the simple fact that it makes the phone HARDER TO HOLD. That's right, while most other cases try to maximize grippyness, the Ringke SLIM (white) manages to do just the opposite. Maybe it's the cold weather, maybe I'm just not holding it right or maybe it's the &#34;Premium LF Texture&#34; that makes this case so hard to grip. It will slide out of your hands, it will slide out of your pocket, it will slide off your desk if you try to prop it up on a book.Granted, I came from a fantastic TPU case on my old phone and maybe I'm just not used to how slim hard cases like this are supposed to behave. Regardless, I actually feel safer with my phone NOT in the case, rather than in it.Pros:Cheaper than a lunch at Panera.Cutouts are well placed and give easy access to ports and buttons.Allows you to place your phone face down and not worry about scratching the screen (like gorilla glass could scratch anyway).Style does not detract from the aesthetic of the Nexus 5.Cons:The finish is a bit on the rough side. Lot's of sharp edges that dig into your hand. (I considered breaking out the sandpaper)EXCESSIVELY tight fit. I thought I would break my phone while trying to remove the case.WILL SLIP RIGHT OUT OF YOUR HANDS.I never drop my phone. I mean NEVER. I was never more afraid of dropping my device than I was when I had this case on it.My advice: avoid this case. At least the white one, anyway. The black case is supposed to have a different texture on it and may in fact be a better grip. I'm not going to waste anymore money to find out though, went back to TPU.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EPLTC1I" id="B00EPLTC1I-review51" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-25:</strong> Amazingly slim and sexy but I'm just a touch worried about drop protection.

It has a minimalist design that doesn't add much bulk to the phone, but protects the Nexus 5 surprisingly well in a fall.The case fits well and offers very good protection considering how non-obtrusive it is. It is made out of good quality materials and is very well made. We have no complaints and especially like its thin profile, and that it doesn't inhibit access to the headphone jack or USB port. We also like that it doesn't cover up the Nexus's ceramic buttons.The material this case is made out of is soft, but not that sticky-silicon material that makes it difficult to slide your phone into and out of pockets.Even without considering the sub-$10 price point, this is a great value for a good quality case. I accidentally dropped the phone once so far, in the driveway, and the phone was not damaged. The case didn't come off, and just got a small scratch in the corner. Fortunately, it wasn't a very high fall, but based on how well the Nexus 4 version of this case has held up over the last year, I suspect it would have been fine, even in a higher fall.We recommend this case if you are looking for the most minimalist possible protection for your phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EPLTC1I" id="B00EPLTC1I-review56" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-11:</strong> This case is very well made.

In fact, a few times people came up to me to remind me it's a good idea to get case until I make them take a closer look.That said, I've been checking the corners of my phone and find no scratching what so ever. The case is a tight fit and I have a feeling people are not taking the time to carefully put it on their phone which is causing the scratching. Or they are in a very dusty environment and dust is getting trapped behind the case and within the case. As for drop protections, no significant drop (more than 3+ ft) but I can tell you each time it has dropped, you can't find any scratches on the outside of the case. So far I've been nothing but absolutely happy with it. I am thinking about getting one in red. Black on black can be a little hard to find when you are in a dark room.

For the price it is a steal.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0040HT3QQ" id="B0040HT3QQ-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-20:</strong> This is a great idea for the iPhone as it holds my phone and otter box protector.  After about a week the belt loops start to rip from the case. I tried using gorilla tape but it does not work that well.  It is some much better than the clip on carrier which has "spring-bing".  I think the only choice is to buy several at a good price and change them routinely when belt loops go.  It has a very strong belt clip that will hold the phone case on your belt but provides less security if someone tries to grab your phone.Not great but the best idea I have seen for a phone with the otter box protector.  Just order several at a time.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0040HT3QQ" id="B0040HT3QQ-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-18:</strong> If it were not so inexpensive I would return it.Oh I can get it in the case, it just fits so darn tight it peels the silicone cover loose from the polycarb case.Is only of fair quality but really, its only 5 bucks, so I didnt expect it to be a quality case no matter if they do claim it to be a $45.00 case.But I was hoping it would fit as they say it would.I see where many folks say it fits just fine, which must bring quality control into issue for the case manufacturer on sizing its product.This is one of the few purchases i have made from Amazon I didnt like and I feel I have reviewed it fairly.The seller served me well with prompt shipping, just dont like this product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0040HT3QQ" id="B0040HT3QQ-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-21:</strong> This product is perfect.

It looked like a basic hard metal case...which it is - but it's more glossy & slippery than what I expected.  Also, it picks up oils from your fingers and looks really greasy within hours.  You can't eat and touch it - it'll look like you deep fried it.  It fits well though...but it does not extend forward enough to protect the phone if it were dropped glass-down like most cases...so...I would not recommend it at all.  My friend has one & likes hers - but I honestly don't get why this is better than no case at all.  It doesn't offer any drop protection, just protects from scratches at best.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008TJYPXC" id="B008TJYPXC-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-28:</strong> This is a really nice iPhone case !

I figured how good could a cheap case be. I was right...The case is good looking and fit great. However, I thought "wow this is really hard plastic and feels like it will break easy." Boy was I right! I dropped the phone approx 1 foot onto a table. Bottom of the case cracked off. Then a few days later I dropped the phone onto tile floor. This time it really cracked and is not almost non-usable. It did save my phone, for that I am thankful, however I purchased a case for a reason - to absorb bumps and drops. This does neither it just breaks. Time to go looking for a new case.

This case fulfilled my need very well for a time. Unfortunately after 2 months the corner broke when I dropped the phone so the case is no longer usable, but the phone IS NOT DAMAGED!!!! I like the slimness which was the reason I got this. I wanted a case for protection only, I didn't want to detract from the thinness of the phone or add any bulk. This case was a great purchase for the money and the cause, it performed it's job wonderfully</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008TJYPXC" id="B008TJYPXC-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-26:</strong> With the limited number of choices of quality iPhone 5 cases, I decided I would buy this as a temporary case until better options come out.  It was a nice surprise when I received a fairly good case with some minor issues.The case is a fairly hard but somewhat flexible glossy plastic and its thin.  I got the white one which is nearly impossible to see any fingerprints on.  That may be due to the color more than anything else.  Its easy to put the iPhone into the case and there is good coverage on the sides.  Much poorer coverage on the top and bottoms.  But the corners do have some protection should you drop it.  The Side buttons line up nicely in the case but the apple logo cutout is not cut correctly so the Apple logo sits slightly to the lower right.  A little annoying but meh, oh well.  The phone sits well in the case and is tight to the phone.The case comes with a mini microfiber cloth which looks as cheap as you would expect.  It also comes with a film for the screen and a little circular film to cover the Apple logo on the back.  The film seems to be of a somewhat decent quality.  My favorite films are the PowerSupport ones but they don't haven't released one for the iPhone 5 as of this review.  The film that comes with case is no where near the quality of the PowerSupport films.  (Not that I would expect it to be).  But, its definitely better than what you would expect from an included accessory.  Applying the film was easy, I did get some dust under the film which caused me to have some air bubbles but I do believe if I was more careful it could have installed on without air bubbles.  Oh well, I still plan on upgrading to the PowerSupport ones when its released.In Summary, I would give the case 4.5 stars, the film 4 stars and the microfiber cloth 2 stars.  For the entire package considering the early adopter penalties, I would give this a 4.5 star in value.  If it had better coverage on the top and bottom of the phone, I would have given it 5 stars.  But, I may stick with this one...Pretty happy with the purchase and considering it was one of the cheaper options at $17, a good value.UPDATE:  A number of new cases has been released since my review.  I wanted to add that the $30 Lightning/dock adapter does fit with this case.  I changed then switched back to this case because of this.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008TJYPXC" id="B008TJYPXC-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-07:</strong> fits well and is good looking, but the color is chipping off and it will have to be replaced too soon.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008TJYPXC" id="B008TJYPXC-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-20:</strong> The yellow started peeling off.

I may be worn on either side of the body and can be oriented horizontally or vertically. The clip swivels nicely so that it may be worn in a number of different configurations. I decided to wear mine home from work yesterday and the first time I exited and reentered the car, the holster caught on the seat back and the clip broke off. I thought it was ruined, but to my amazement, I discovered the clip had only popped out of its slot on the holster itself and I was able to pop it right back in with no permanent damage. This makes it even more of a great deal to me. I tend to be extremely rough on phone holsters.This holster is a bit pricey, but considering it has already stood up to my abuse, I can't complain about the price. There are others on the market for less, but I generally prefer to stick with the name brands which are usually more trustworthy. I HIGHLY recommend this holster for Mophie users.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00ED2PEHA', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00ED2PEHA', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B005XYU45E</h2>    <p class="price"> $B005XYU45E</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

This is the best smart phone on the market for the time being until iPhone 5 or Samsung Galaxy S3 releases. I had iPhone 4 for 2 months and I like many other people who could not be satisfied with beauty and fruit brand alone threw that 'dumb beauty' . For me that was more of a 'show off' rather than of practical use.Apple itself in a recent patent suit directed against google termed this as the "most creditable competitor to iPhone'. Apple co founder which is not a apple employee anymore and hence free to speak truth freely declared iPhone easy to use but 'Android more feature rich'. He dismissed Siri totally saying he could not understand how come internet could be needed to make a call through Siri. Do I need to say more now? If yes then here is the detail review:Like ->(1) Bigger HD contour display-> Though you can distinguish between pixels while looking closely unlike iPhone's Retina display, Nexus's display is gorgeous. Colors are very vibrant and rich. Black is real black (because of Super AMOLED display technology) which creates the whole difference.The Screen is large and with medium hands I can reach to the whole screen stretching the thumb or fingers. Sometimes I tend to use the other hand (luckily I have two hands and both are fully functional so can't complaint).Because of bigger screen this phone is more useful or convenient for what Apple invented iPhone for ie Browsing web, playing games, watching videos. And because of this I tend to depend lesser on PC/laptop/tablet. With bigger screen, power and customization of Android OS this phone is closer to our old friend PC/laptop.**I run the same HD video both on nexus and iPhone 4S and nexus one was better to watch.**(2) Soul-> The soul of this device is ICS OS which is now equal to iOS in terms of user friendlessness but is better because it is much more customizable and hence you feel completely in control and power. This is different feeling than using dumb iOS. After using ICS I really struggled to use the iOS or same iOS based apps. ICS is lightning fast and smooth.Face unlock, NFC, android beam and google wallet (not available on Verizon version) are very cool. Face unlock works perfectly.Built-in Data usage monitor is very helpful for not letting you go above your data limit.-> Mine is international unlocked version which within a week got automatically updated to 4.0.2 from 4.0.1.This has Best notification, better customization for web browsing.Ohhhhhhhh... did I tell you android has taken two steps which is miles ahead of time and going to change the things completely? (i) No Physical button-> The buttons are in fact part of OS itself and function well. Hence the buttons can now be context specific and smarter. They change their position depending on how you are holding the phone or what you are doing. While watching video they disappear completely giving you the whole screen for watching, and yes they will reappear on appropriate place when you need them. (ii) Same OS for all devices: Unlike Apple now same application can run on any device running on ICS. For apple the applications need to be written separately both for iPhone and iPad. That's why Apple has lesser applications on iPads. With new approach of ICS now people will just write once and run it anywhere hence number of apps is going to get multiplied faster on ICS.(3) Eco System (Apps)-> Android eco system (or app market) is there on par with Apple eco system. In the same period I have installed more applications than I did on iPhone 4 (because most applications are free compared to Apple). I am more functional on Android than I was on iPhone 4. There is nothing which I want and its not there. And yes now google going to start monitoring of applications so less argument against Android apps.(4) Form factor-> I like its form factor more than of iPhone's. Countered makes it more convenient to use and keep in the pocket. Now to me iPhone is just any another device and I look on iPhone with pity.(5) Battery-> I need to charge it once a day with low to moderate usage which is what other iPhone 4S customers are also doing. And if you are going to use it like laptop you will need to charge it more (is not this same with your laptop?). Better part is unlike iPhone you can carry batteries and change it easily. No complaint here.(6) Reception-> Decent.(7) Call quality-> Nice.(8) Volume/Speaker-> Low, could be helped with volume control plus application.(9) More social-> Very well integrated with google.(10). Build-> Except the battery cover everything else is of high quality. I don't care about plastic versus metal debate. iPhone even with metal and corning glass are equivalently fragile and people have been reporting iPhone being broken having dropped just from 12 feet or so. And with gorilla glass on both ends iPhone 4 is more fragile. Remember gorilla glass is just scratch resistant not damage resistant.(11) Typing-> is a breeze and it seems to read you mind and hence make typing a different experience than on iPhone. And big screen helps every here again.Unfortunately this phone decided to do have some deliberate suicidal traits perhaps to avoid wiping away other Samsung devices. So here are the things which could have been improved upon:(1) Speaker-> Could have been better (Minor+ issue)(2) Reception-> Though not much complaint, Could have been just a 'little' better (Very Minor issue).(3) Camera-> Could have been better definitely.(4) External Storage-> Either they should have allowed adding external storage or given the device with more alternated with respect to storage capacities. (Minor issue)(5) Display-> Should not be able to distinguish pixels (Minor issue but this should be ultimate goal for the display)Conclusion-> This is the best smart phone on the market for the time being if you can live with some minor issue with volume. And all issues reported so far with this device seem to be software issues and should get corrected with updates or third part applications.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005XYU45E" id="B005XYU45E-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-20:</strong> I haven't had any issues with this phone.

The only thing I was worried about was the camera, but that's not really an issue after all, as it takes great photos, especially with some apps from the Play Store. The screen is gorgeous, and so is the phone. I love the clean front that is free of logos, and the textured back feels and looks great. The phone is covered with plastic, but the plastic is covering a steel chassis, so the phone feels much sturdier in the hand than most plastic-clad Samsung phones. It does not feel or look cheap at all, looks more premium than the Galaxy SII, Samsung Infuse, or even the Galaxy SIII, to me anyway.I highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants a Pure Google experience on a beautiful phone!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005XYU45E" id="B005XYU45E-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-13:</strong> Good size device for my gf.

You're looking for the latest (at the time of release) Pure Google Experience phone, and you're not waiting around for AT&T; or T-Mobile to bring this little beauty stateside.  You're a premium cell phone connoisseur who wants perhaps the best Android phone ever, and wants it now!First off, this is the GSM Unlocked version of the Samsung Galaxy Nexus.  You Verizon and Sprint users are going to want to move along, as purchasing this phone will only lead you to utter frustration.  This phone's unlocked pentaband radio means that you'll have little trouble setting this up on US T-Mobile or AT&T; 2g or 3g. Let's also not forget that the phone supports 21 Mbps HSPA+ speeds, meaning you won't have 4G LTE speeds, but you'll get great speeds on T-Mobile or AT&T;'s networks (note that actual coverage and speeds will vary based on location).So now that you've figured out that you need this phone and that it will work on your network, how is the phone?Two words: "Simply Amazing."I've used many Android phones, and I can honestly say that this phone is perhaps the BEST ANDROID PHONE EVER RELEASED.  As a Pure Google Experience phone, you'll receive Android updates essentially straight from Google.  This means you aren't saddled by any unwanted bloatware that cell phone companies or carriers add to their phones, or unwanted UI skins such as Blur or Sense.  Also, it means you won't have to wait for updates.This is the first phone to feature Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS).  I won't bore you with the intricacies of ICS, but I'll let you know that the phone operates extremely smooth.  Powered by ICS and a 1.2GHZ dual core processor, the phone glides through home screens, menus and applications without a hint of lag.This phone forgoes most physical buttons for on-screen buttons, save for a volume rocker and power/unlock button. This may seem weird at first, but the spacious 4.65" HD (yes, HD!!) screen allows for easy navigation.Speaking of the screen, it looks amazing. I've had no issue viewing outside in direct sunlight like I've had with other phones.  I will warn that if you have smaller fingers, the 4.65" screen might be difficult to manage if you're trying to hold and use the phone one-handed.  But, the added screen space also makes it extremely easy to type in portrait mode, as the screen size provides a portrait keyboard almost the same size as a blackberry.This phone comes with 16GB of internal memory, which is a lot of space, but honestly it would have been nice if they included a micro sd expansion slot for more space.The 5MP camera is pretty good.  It's not a world beater that will replace your point and shoot, but it will get the job done.  What it lacks in picture quality is made up for in software enhancements including almost zero lag shutter capture and the addition of a stock panoramic mode.  Videos can be recorded up to 1080p@30fps using the rear camera, and 720p@30fps using the 1.3MP front-facing camera.  There is also a LED flash on the back. The phone also contains video and picture editing apps from Google so you can quickly and easily edit your pictures/videos.The standard battery for this phone is 1850mAh, which will easily last me through a work day without any tweaks.  You might not get as much mileage out of this as I do, but at least the battery is replaceable and larger batteries are available.My main disappointment with the phone deals with a lack of a dedicated HDMI out port.  Sure, you can use HDMI out, but it requires a separate adapter, and I'm more in favor of phones having a full HDMI or micro HDMI out port instead of using adapters.  Also, note that since this is a Google Experience phone, there is no native DLNA apps installed, but you can find many adequate apps in the market (many for free as well!)Like I said earlier, since you're looking at this phone, you probably already know that you want it, but you're probably trying to figure out if it's worth the hype.  All I can say is that it is TOTALLY WORTH THE HYPE.  I've used this phone for over a week now and absolutely love it.  The only regret I have is that I wish I would have purchased it earlier.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B005XYU45E', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B005XYU45E', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B006CAW1Y0</h2>    <p class="price"> $B006CAW1Y0</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

I've been looking ALL OVER for a charger to charge the extra batteries for our Pantech Ease phones.  Generic chargers that say they work with the Pantech Ease, don't!  This one works WONDERFULLY!

Not only am I satisfied with the seller, but I am also satisfied with the product. My charger port is broken and I have no way to charge my phone via wire. This product saved me. I ordered it and received it fairly quickly! When I opened it up, it was packaged well and it was brand new as promised. I am currently charging my phone using this charger and it's charging pretty well. As for the efficiency of this charger, it is amazing. Very easy to use. If you're worried about the battery size being longer than the actual charger itself, it's okay because my battery is bigger than the charger itself, but the clip holds it down really well. Love this product!

This charger has moveable pins to adjust to fit any battery, not to mention that it has a usb port itself to use as a normal wall charger with usb to micro/mini/specialized plug to ones phone. So in reality it has a dual means of charging a single phone or two from a wall socket. I have even charged a battery from laptop standard USB to Standard USB cable to this charger to charge a battery with the adjustable pins. This is a very versatile unit and something I would expect any techie kind of person to have in their arsenal of tools that they keep on them...next to the linux distro usb, windows live usb, tools, and the like. Many people have found that their USB charging port has gone out...this device saves them. I can't say enough about this device...well worth every penny.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B006CAW1Y0', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B006CAW1Y0', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B0087HFX1E</h2>    <p class="price"> $B0087HFX1E</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

Now that I have been using this about one month I can say it is not as durable as a previously used screen protector I have.  It is a little difficult to get the bubbles out when applying this item and I had to lift up the edge once so one corner did not make good contact after that.  It would be better to have this in a three pack so we could use the other two screen protectors when this one is not useful.  Perhaps I ahould have ordered 3 instead of only 1 but I was overly optimistic because of my previous hard-core screen protector.As for durability, I dropped this phone from about waist high one time and there is a long scratch across the scren protector.  My previous  screen protector had to be dropped from shoulder height on to some very rough concrete before it got a bad scratch.  Hopefully I won't have to buy repeated screen protectors during the life of my phone and this one is just a not so durable fluke.  I know for sure that I am clumsy enough to really need a screen protector so I am off to shop.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0087HFX1E" id="B0087HFX1E-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-15:</strong> Great product...bought extra because it takes a few times to get in on correctly but the price is so reasonable that you have that advantage.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0087HFX1E" id="B0087HFX1E-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-22:</strong> I like the anti-glare and anti-fingerprint but it scratches rather easily, which is unfortunate.

I love the matte finish and anti-glare.  It does not distort the screen.  It does not fit all the way to edge of screen which is a good thing so edges won't be lifting or interfering with the cover.

This means I do not have to pay for the data plan each month, it means I can activate when and only when I want it with no activation or cancellation fees. Right now I plan to use the tablet as a WiFi only, but if I need I can activate broadband data plan (say if I am going on a trip and no sure if there will be WiFi capabilities).This was an expensive way to get this device ($699.99), compared to an international version with WiFi only which is currently $549.99-$659.99. But Verizon unit is not grey market, has US warranty, and I do have an ability to get broadband if I need it. I have a personal deadline for the purchase due to a trip, and there is no information when the WiFi only unit (non-international) will be available.A word of caution if you decide to purchase one at the Verizon store. Some sales staff is not aware that it is possible to buy a prepaid device without purchasing a contract.  Even though I stated I was interested in WiFi only and purchased prepaid no-contract device, the sales clerk charged me both an activation fee and first month service (an additional $86). He said that I can cancel the contract after one month without a cancellation fee. Both charges were a mistake on his part: pre-paid devices never have an activation fee, and I was not required to buy one month service if I did not want it. I was able to correct this problem by speaking to the manager, but it required me to know that he was in error even though he sounded very confident about both charges.While making my purchasing decision I compared IPad 3, ASUS Eee Pad Transformer Prime TF201 10.1, Galaxy 10.1 Tab, Galaxy 7" Tab, Galaxy 7.7" Tab, and Amazon Fire.I wanted a tablet for accessing internet while I am traveling, specifically I want to be able to sell on Ebay, access my email, use Google maps, use Open Table, Yelp, TripAdvisor, and Priceline. Secondarily I want to be able to read Kindle books. Thirdly I want to develop apps for my tablet.Originally, I thought I'd buy Amazon Fire because I am big Amazon fan, have a lot of Kindle books, and the price of Amazon Fire is very attractive.  However when I did hands-on experimentation with various devices, I realized that my internet needs were more important to me that my media needs and Amazon Fire browser was a bit slower than the others, and some of the apps did not run on it.The 10.1 inch tablets felt a little large, I wanted something that I could easily fit in my purse.  The Amazon Fire and the Galaxy 7" tab felt about the size I wanted. However, Galaxy 7" screen resolution made the keyboard cover most of the screen and data entry typing (which I will need to do quite a bit of) was difficult. But when I saw Galaxy 7.7" in a Verizon store it was a hands down winner.  The screen is totally amazing, both the resolution and the colors. In side-by-side comparison with iPad 3, Galaxy's display was better. The tablet itself is very slim (0.31 inches) and weights 12 oz (see photo #2 in a collage of images I posted under customer photos).===============================SCREEN:The AMOLED screen is the best feature of this device. Sharp, crisp, bright. It was the best screen on all devices that I compared before this purchase.  LCD Native Resolution: 1280 x 800 pixels.Photo #1 in my image collage shows the screen, but does not give it full justice.Capacitive touchscreen requires some getting used to (it is my first device with this type of interface). I am getting better and placing things where I want them, but sometimes it takes several attempts.  I like the keyboard, it has a nice feedback and once I got used to the timing (you need to slightly pause between keystrokes) I am not making a lot of mistakes. The most difficult operation is to insert the letter in the middle of the text. Due to high resolution of the screen it is possible to use the keyboard in horizonal orientation and still see enough of the screen to make it usable (something I could not do well in my tests of Galaxy 7.0)===============================SIZE:I consider the tablet's size its second most important to me feature.  Big enough not only to play but do some work, yet small enough to be portable.Size (LWH): 7.74 inches, 5.2 inches, 0.31 inchesWeight: 12 ounces (photo #2 shows Galaxy on the postal scale)===============================BATTERY LIFE:Galaxy 7.7 has Li-Po 5100 mAh which is rated for 1200h of stand-by time.After charging it over night, the next day I used it continuously in disconnected mode for 8 hours. This was 8 hours of heavy usage: installing, testing, and uninstalling apps. After 8 hours of non-stop use the battery went down to 20% (at which point it gave me a warning beep). I put it back into the charger and in 3 hours the battery was back up to 96%.  On the day that it was in stand-by mode and just buzzed when I got mail, the battery went down only 12%.===============================STORAGE:The unit came with 16GB and has microSD memory card slot which accepts up to 32GB.===============================USB:It has a regular USB connection. When attached my computer it appears as drive and I can access as any USB device for copying content.  It can also be charged this way, but a slower rate than the dedicated charger.===============================SPEAKERS:The tablet has stereo speakers 3.5mm jack, and the sound it generates is very good.  The volume with and without speakers has a large range. I enjoyed listening it to it with and without headphones.===============================CAMERA:The cameras on the tablet are not the strong point of this tablet. It is okay in a pinch, but I don't see using either one of them much.  However, I am serious photography amateur and have several fairly good cameras so I have a certain bias when evaluating this feature.  I am attaching 2 photos taken by the tablet. One with a flash and one without a flash.  As you see the one taken without a flash is a little soft.===============================KINDLE READER:Kindle reader app looks the same as the PC Kindle Reader.  For usability, I actually prefer the Amazon Cloud reader, which also works by connecting to it from the browser.===============================NEGATIVES:Not much so far!1. Galaxy 7.7 still runs on Honey Comb 3.2 but slated to upgrade to ICS (date unknown). So it is missing some capabilities that are available in ICS. So far the one that mattered to me is that Chrome browser is not available for Honey Comb, and there is no perfect tool for syncing your bookmarks at no additional cost. Chromemarks light is not integrated with the browser. Xmarks and Chromemarks commercial versions are the non-free alternatives.2. The touch screen takes some getting used to.  You need to learn to delay between keystroke when typing. Positioning on a specific letter to correct a spelling mistake is not that easy.===============================COMPARISON of some basic features between Galaxy 7.7" and Galaxy 7" Tabs:-------------------------------7" Galaxy:Size (LWH): 7.62 inches, 4.82 inches, 0.39 inchesWeight: 12.16 ounces-------------------------------7.7" Galaxy:Size (LWH): 7.74 inches, 5.2 inches, 0.31 inchesWeight: 12 ounces===============================7" Galaxy:Honey Comb 3.2 plus TouchWizDual Core 1.2 GHZ CPU-------------------------------7.7" Galaxy:Honey Comb 3.2 plus TouchWiz (announced it will get ICS)Dual-core 1.4 GHz CPU===============================7" Galaxy:LCD Native Resolution: 1024 x 600 pixels-------------------------------7.7" Galaxy:LCD Native Resolution: 1280 x 800 pixelsDisplay Type Super AMOLED Plus capacitive touchscreen===============================7" Galaxy:3.0 MP rear camera, 2.0 MP front camera-------------------------------7.7" Galaxy:3.15 MP rear camera, 2.0 MP front camera===============================If you are looking for a leather case for this tablet, I am pleased with this oneSamsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 Leather Folio Case for Tablet Black Cover Protector.  See my review/photos of it for more details.So far I am quite pleased with Galaxy 7.7, it is just the right size for my needs and the screen makes it a pleasure to work with even for my presbyopic eyes.Update 6/27/12After using the table for 2.5 month daily I still love it. No problems or complaints!I was wondering how the updates for the tablet would go without a data plan. I am happy to report that I was able to successfully perform over the air update (a minor update to Honeycomb).  To check for updates select "Settings", then "About device", and then on the right hand side there will be an option for "System updates".  If there is an update available it will be listed there.Ali Julia review</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006UAOE42" id="B006UAOE42-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-14:</strong> I bought the Samsung Galaxy 6810, the WiFi only version, about a month ago.

The WIFI only you can get for 199.00 less than half this one, and comes with an IR port but 3g so trade off. I decided to keep the international 3g one even though I realy realy wanted the IR port.Its just to convient to use this device for every thing. I use net flix alot and looks good on this device. I get true 3g on this thing andf I mean american 3g. That means the so called HSPA service is chocked to 3g DL and my upload is 1g. I read reports the tab overseas will get upward of 20g dl one the European 3g. So its back to Iphone 3gs speeds. So if ur willing to give up any hope of decent speed look some were eles (AT&T; unlimited data plan) prepaid and other provider might produce better results if so let me know.Im only giving it 4 stars because price is to high considering u only get 3g and the price which should be down for multiple reasons and no IR port like its US brother.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006UAOE42" id="B006UAOE42-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-25:</strong> I had this tablet for a while but recently decided to get rid of it.  Spec wise it was a very good tablet and the display was awesome.  I bought it because I wanted a smaller tablet to use along side my iPad... something that I could easily hold with one hand to browse the web, read news, and occasionally watch movies/etc.Pros:1. UNLOCKED!  Just get a sim card and pop it in and you're ready to go2. Can double as a phone when traveling international... don't get me wrong, I'd never put this thing up to my face to make a call... I'd most likely use this as a speakerphone or use it with a bluetooth headset3. Great display... Super AMOLED is very goodCons:1. Difficult for me to use one handed (deal breaker).  I have normal sized hands for a guy I'd say and I could just barely hold this thing one handed without a case.2. The UI I felt was a bit sluggish, especially compared to my iPad which I have had no issues with in terms of swiping back and forth/etc.3. Text size.  While the display on this tablet is really good for movies/etc, I wasn't too fond of it for reading anything for more than occasional reading hear and there.  The text ended up being too small for me to be comfortable to read for any extended period of time.  I know there are probably apps out there to adjust the font size but it should have been part of the tablet to begin with.4. Battery life... this thing drained constantly on me even with the cell radio turned off.  With my iPad, I can leave it unplugged for more than a week and the battery life would barely budge whereas with the 7.7 I found that I'd have to keep charging it every day even with little to no use.5. Very slow to update... took forever for Samsung to release ICS to this device...6. Touchwiz interface a little sluggish and the extra features they added weren't too useful for meConclusion:While the galaxy tab 7.7 is a good tablet (esp the unlocked international version) it's just not for me...  It felt like this tablet was trying to do too much in one package while not really taking in to consideration the form factor that many people buy a 7" tablet for in my opinion.  If it were a little less wide, had a native option to increase the font size of text in the browser, and had a true standby where battery life would not drain then this would be a great tablet.  As it stands, I could not really recommend this as anything more than a device for watching movies and tv shows with occasional browsing and reading.  I found myself reaching for my iPad 90% of the time when I had the 7.7 mostly because the 7.7 wasn't that much more convenient for me to hold than the iPad.  I'll probably give the Nexus 7 a try for my second tablet as it looks to be a bit more in line with what I'm looking for in terms of one hand holding and portability.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006UAOE42" id="B006UAOE42-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-29:</strong> I have the i815 version of this tablet, which is pretty much the same thing only it has a Verizon logo on it.This is an interesting little tablet. Previously, I've used an ipad 2 and a Nook HD+It is very thin. Extremely thin. It is about as thick as the ipod touch 5g that I also own.This is the only tablet 7 inches and above which you can obtain with an AMOLED screen, and that is the defining feature of this tablet. Since tablets are all about screen quality, this is a huge factor in deciding to purchase.The screen is simply incredible. Watching movies on it, I feel like I'm watching my 50" plasma screen. I don't get the same feeling watching video on the ipad, the nook, or on my home pc with a 24" screen.The camera is also pretty decent, although it seems that it needs to use the flash in order to get sharp pictures.Now, there are numerous frustrating downsides. The Samsung customizations to Android are simply terrible. They slow it down and a lot of design choices are simply bad. For instance, if you want to use a bluetooth keyboard with the device, you also have to use the default Samsung software keyboard. This samsung software keyboard a) does not have a voice recognition button and b) you cannot disable vibrate on button press with it. Other annoyances include that there on the default menu besides the home and back and multi-window button is also a button which captures a screenshot. This is inexplicable. You can change it to a more useful bring up all programs function, but it is simply bad design. There are also a number of useless Samsung apps that exist on the device.The worst sin of all is that this tablet has not upgraded to Jelly Bean. It is still stuck on Ice Cream Sandwich. This might seem minor, except that Jelly Bean is a significant improvement over ICS. You see, Jelly Bean, which is android 4.1 and above, implemented "project butter" which greatly improved the responsiveness of the system. It is still not near as smooth as the iPad 2, but still is a very noticeable improvement over previous versions of Android. Simple things like text scrolling are much better in Jelly Bean than they are in ICS. Jelly Bean was released over a year ago, but on my device at least, there has been no update to the latest version.Luckily, there is a solution to all of these problems.You can, and I have, installed a custom ROM on my tablet called "Cyanogenmod." It is a little difficult, you have to run a program called Odin, set the device in USB debug mode, startup the device in USB load mode by powering it on and holding volume down, load the ClockWorkMod in place of the default recovery, unplug the USB, load a Cyanogenmod .zip file and Google Apps (GAPPS) .zip file onto a micro-sd card, start up ClockWorkMod by starting the device while holding volume up, select the Cyanogenmod .zip file and load it, and then the GAPPS file --It's a lot of work and took me about 3 hours to figure out.But once you load Jelly Bean on this tablet, it is a significant improvement over the stock Samsung ROM. It isn't perfect by a long shot -- still not as stable as the ipad 2, will sometimes hangup especially while web browsing, but otherwise it feels *much* better than ICS.And once rooted, one great advancement is that you can actually load a program onto the device which enables NTFS and exFAT support. This might seem minor, except what it means is that you can load files that exceed FAT32's 4gb file limit. That means....large movie files, to best use the awesome AMOLED screen.So, in short, great hardware, lousy official firmware, I take one star off because of the trouble I have to go through in order to get the vanilla Android onto the device, but good tablet especially for cinema.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006UAOE42" id="B006UAOE42-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-02:</strong> I own a p1000 last year and wait to get the p6800 until now.  It's everything I wanted and expected; however, the contents inside the box aren't the same as the ones in the unboxing videos at youtube.com.  In the videos and reviews on many websites, there are two 30pins: 1 attached to the outlet plug and the 2nd for laptop synching and stuffs.  In my box, I see only one that looks exactly like the charger in the p1000 with the exception of the Asian outlet plug or somewhere, non-US.  Another odd thing is that the Samsung seal broke before I get a chance to it after I unwrapped the shrink wrap.  That's very strange!  The tablet appears untouched; however, the battery is completely drained.  After allowing it to charge for 10 minutes, I turn it on and check the battery usage and see that the battery draining started 13 days ago starting from around 45% to complete depletion base on the graph.  No other battery history.  I order this tablet 7 days ago.  This p6800 originates from Asia.  Given the date of production, shipping to seller, shelving, and shipping to me should've taken at least one month instead of 13 days.  IMO, I paid for a brand new p6800 and that's what I should have received.  Not something that had been tampered with.  No matter what the reason the seller uses to justify his/her action.  Broken the seal by Samsung and re-shrink wrap it is a complete dishonesty!Besides the accessories, all functions of the p6800 work 100% & w/o a single dead pixel (good news!).  The minor concern that I have with it is that it can get a bit warm on the middle left of the tablet.  It can be bothersome if I hold it with my left hand.  Super AMOLED Plus minimum brightness is still very bright (solution: screen filter app).I played around with it a little bit on 3.2 and then upgrade to ICS 4.04.  The 3.2 gingerbread is bad as other reviewers complained.  The samsung p1000 on 2.2 is better than the p6800 on the 3.2.  4.04 is great and smooth!  I'll have a chance to play with it some more tomorrow :D</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006UAOE42" id="B006UAOE42-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-07:</strong> There's not a lot I can add to the glowing reviews for this tablet. There really is no competition out there. My only disappointment with this version is that it doesn't include the IR transmitter port or remote control functionality, but that is by no means a deal-breaker, especially since the reviews of that functionality are pretty poor and it doesn't yet work with many different types of equipment. I'm sick and tired of the idiots who keep saying of 7" class tablets: "This would be great if it were a 10 inch". Bull Hockey! I have a 10" tablet, and they are just too big to be useful. My netbook is almost as easy to carry around as a 10" tablet, and is way more powerful and will do a whole lot more and has a real keyboard besides. The ones that have keyboard docks are even more useless, because they have less than half the functionality of a netbook with exactly no more portability. I really don't see the point of the larger tablets. On the other hand, the 7" class are much more portable and have most of the advantage of the larger screen size with 100% of the computing power of the larger ones.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006UAOE42" id="B006UAOE42-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-12:</strong> I bought this for a friend and he really likes it.

I love my Iphone 5.  I am also a tech geek who likes to try out other things, frequently.  I was wanting to learn more about Windows Phone but didn't want to switch my phone with AT&T; as it is expensive to do.  So my wife had surprised me and bought this unlocked phone for me for a birthday present.  It is simply put a very nice phone.  Windows Phone software 7.5 is good, not great, but good.  The phone itself is really nice.  Good battery life and a battery that you can swap by removing the back cover.  This feature alone would give it 5 starts.  I don't like the sealed up battery on new phones, don't like the fact you have to return to a service center for a battery replacement.  Also if so inclined you could buy a spare battery and have it charged up and put it in your pocket then change it while you are out, if your battery runs low.  The battery life on this is pretty good.  The only complaint I have about this phone is the fonts are small and most are unchangeable.  When typing a text message, you cannot increase the font of the menu items (like send, attach, etc) and have to rely on the pictures.The phone has a beautiful screen and a great feel in your hand - feels solid and not cheesy.Well worth it for the money.

I have one of these cases,GreatShield Guardian S Series Slim-Fit S-Line Design TPU Case for Samsung Galaxy S3 - Blackwhich is pretty good, but I was a little worried about stuff getting into it and rubbing the back of the phone.  I had not had issues, but the shiny areas inside of that case started showing rubbing from some dirt or whatever getting in there.This Seidio case has a nice felt back which will hopefully put less pressure against the back if any debris gets in there.  It has cutouts for the power and volume buttons which  I like more than the covered buttons, but the front part sticking out over the sides makes it feel a little weird.  Probably would feel better if that area of the front were indented, but it is also protecting the button area.  So I'll leave it as is.I expected the surface to be a little more grippy, but it is ok.  The case is harder plastic than I expected which I hope will protect in an impact.  The other case was softer so has protected my phone in drops before.  This is stiffer and I hope acts like a box in an impact.It can be hard to take apart.  I recommend taking it apart without the phone in it a few times before putting the phone in.  That seemed to work it in a little.  The first time I tried taking it apart it was very tough so I had to place the phone face down and use the back of a pen to press the area down until the top half came free.  After letting it wear in a bit or maybe just figuring out how to get it to work I can hold it from the back between my thumb and 2nd finger, press the area with my index finger and pull the top off with the other hand.The belt holster works well although I really haven't used it other than to try it out.  I pocket carry and was mainly getting the holster because once in a while pocket carry doesn't work.  Also it wasn't much more expensive with it, while buying the holster separately is almost as much buying the combo.Update:  One thing I hadn't noticed until later was the back isn't perfectly flat. The side that goes over the side is higher than the other.  So it wobbles.  I actually almost always lay it flat on its face or have it propped vertically so it doesn't bother me, but I think it would be very annoying for people trying to use their phone face up.Another thing I've noticed is I drop my phone a lot more with this case than the old one due to it being a little harder and slicker.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008CZNALG" id="B008CZNALG-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-02:</strong> Bought this case as a gift for my Mom who wanted something that wouldn't be too bulky but they she could clip onto her purse so it doesn't get lost in the depths.

My only quibble is that the case is VERY difficult to remove the first few times. I actually had to cut a square of felt under the finger mark at the seam so the case would flex enough in that spot to release.

The phone is slow, lags, and exhibits the following wonderful traits:1.  WiFi instability issue NEVER fixed since release2.  Muting the phone then restoring sound keeps all volume at 0.  You must manually increase the volume.3.  Text input by Swype will often spell the word but not insert it4.  Loses 4G signal then switches back and cannot send mobile data5.  Slow and laggy.  Gets worse with each update6.  Camera takes smeared, blotchy photos in anything but bright light7.  Screen almost impossible to see in bright daylight8.  Samsung Bloatware sucks up all RAM.  You won't have more than 500 MB of RAM free at any one time9.  Piss poor design means that a muted phone will still BLAST that AT&T; ringtone when the phone spontaneously restarts10.  Music decoding will insert skips into some songs (especially jazz songs)11.  NFC never works well the first time or the second or the third12.  Screen attracts and holds all grease until wiped with pure alcohol13.  Without power saver and auto screen bright, you will get about half a day out of this if you are playing music and doing light browsing.Samsung doesn't give a damn about their customers, they just want a sucker to pay a lot for their beta test phones.  You won't get ANY fixes to the Note 3 until you buy a Note 4.  I'll never buy another Samsung product again as long as I live.  I'm going to either Sony or Nokia.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F33OE06" id="B00F33OE06-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-10:</strong> This could be the last stop for the browser of an advanced android phone.It has everything an advanced android phone is supposed to have,A super fast processor,Great screen,pictures movies.Easily the number one android device.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F33OE06" id="B00F33OE06-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-29:</strong> NOTE:  Samsung gets 0 stars, the phone gets 5 stars, even 6.The Note 3 is awesome, but customers should be upset over the SIMM lock on it, and NOT get this N9000 model.  The N9005 or a carrier model is the only way to go.This international version is not for US users or even US users who travel. If you are not a traveler forget the comments about it being region locked.I still say 99.9% of all people who get the Note 3 could not care less if the international version is region locked.  However, this model, if you expect to use it in other countries has resulted in a thousand problems, literally. The phone is neutral but when it is activated the SIMM locks in the region and you cannot use it elsewhere.  Do not think "unlocked" means you have magical usage.  There is NO universal phone (except for spies), although some phones use other country SIMM cards -- but not this one!  I get a US carrier phone, travel internationally, and keep my phone in airplane mode and use WIFI or get a phone card.Get the scoop.  Do a search for XDA-Developers dot com, and go to the site. This is where the big boys and girls hang, for programming, not dumb questions.Type in Galaxy Note 3 in the field for the phone you desire.In the Forums, go to galaxy note 3 general.Search down the page to the thread "SIMM restrictions on unlocked European Note 3."  This thread has over 1300 posts.  Yes this is a big problem.Read the first half dozen pages and the last 10 pages, but also check especially posts 1041 through 1045, and pages 117 and 18.This N9000 phone is the international or European version. It was released 2-3 weeks prior to the US versions, it is NOT LTE it is 3G; it has a different CPU -the Samsung Exynos 5 processor, not the Qualcom Snapdragon 800. US residents should not get it.  We need to get a phone activated for our respective carriers, which changes the last digit of the number. Search Amazon for the Note 3 for your carrier.  Notice the different last digit.Amazon may be confusing people by not listing the phone for what it really is and they need to change that in the title of the phone.  The black version does say 'International" in the title and so should the white one.Now, down to business.First, I am not affiliated with Samsung in any way, nor do I work for a cell phone store.  I am a writer though.Secondly, I hate long reviews where the poster just reports the specs you already have.  Rather, these comments show why the Galaxy Note 3 is more technologically advanced, and more phone for your money, compared to the many good phones on the market today, and the not so good phones, like the cave phone (that's what I call it) that does nothing.1.  The beautiful  5.7" Super Amoled HD display has a "Wow!"  factor.  Everything is crisp and clear with a resolution of 1920 x 1080P, 386 PPI.  Despite a few good contenders, no phone on the market can match the combination of vibrant color, and deep blacks.  Check it out for yourself.  For those who prefer drab, you can even adjust color intensity and contrast.Is this practical?  You bet.  You get more viewable data for all social networking apps;  you can see more email and contacts without scrolling; browsing is quick and pages more visible; YouTubes and video are fantastic; games are more playable; you can see larger areas on GPS maps;  you get a better view of radar in weather; (live) wallpapers look great; you can use it as a reader; you can multitask with it; and with the right productivity apps you can even get some work done on it.  I will never go back to a small screen phone.2.  The CPU in the US versions is the quad core Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 @ 2.3, which is the fastest processor on the planet as of this time.  It will perform well for years to come.  A few other phones have it.  The international version uses the Samsung Exynos 5 processor. It also has another quad core processors making it octa core, but it is still not quite as fast as the Snapdragon.3.  The Adreno 330 GPU is the best on the market, a few other phones have it.  It is 50% faster than the Adreno 320 in the Galaxy S4 which is a screamer.4.  It's the only phone to come with 3 GB of DDR 3 RAM.  It also comes standard with 32 gigs of storage  and you can add more with an SD card.  Note: No extra charges for these!5.  It has a great 13 megapixel camera with useful software, a BSI Sensor, Smart Digital Stabilization and high CRI LED.  Very few phones have this.  It is also the only phone to  do 4K video right now - sharp!6.  No other phone has USB 3.0.  2 advantages: the phone charges very quickly on the 2 amp charger and nice thick cable.  File transfer times are faster.  With USB 3.0, a 2 gig file takes 27 seconds from the Note 3 to my (high end) PC.  With USB 2.0 the same file takes 57 seconds.7.  How many phones have an S Pen?  Except for email and quick notes, I seldom used the S Pen on my original Galaxy Note, but the Note 3 comes with some useful software making it more functional,  and the handwriting recognition is scary accurate.8.  How many phones have a huge 3200 mA battery?  It easily lasts all day with moderate to heavy use despite the large screen.  Hardware and software improvements make the 100 mA bump over the Note 2 even more significant.  You can also open the back and change out the battery - unlike some phones.9.  It does infrared remote control.  It also has TV-out (via MHL  A/V link),  Accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, barometer, temperature, humidity, and gesture sensor.  I'm serious people, you get more for your money.10.  Hello multitasking!  The fast CPU & GPU, extra memory, and high-resolution 5.7 inch screen make multitasking feasible and fun on a cell phone.  You can even scroll through multiple applications in each split screen.  This is even better if you hook up a keyboard and mouse via Bluetooth or USB, and connect through HDMI to your TV or computer monitor.  The Note 3 can actually serve as a small computer.  How many phones can do that?  You can also mirror the phone screen with your smart TV for internet, games, viewing pics, whatever.11.  This the best cell phone for gaming on the market , period.  The above features and OpenGL 3.0 which is part of Android 4.3 make it happen.  Don't believe me?  Read the reviews, watch the you tubes, and compared it for yourself.12.  It doesn't just have GPS, it also uses A GPS (improved), and Glonass Satellites.  DL a GPS satellite app, and you'll see it will access between 5 and 25 satellites at once depending on time of day and location.13.  Got Knox?  No, you don't.  This phone provides business enterprise, and government level security for boot, VPN, etc., and comes in handy for privacy on public Wi-Fi.  You don't have to use it, but it is there.14.  The air command and air gesture features make the phone futuristic.  How many phones do that?15.  Is the screen too large for one handed operation?  Yes, but so what?  The tradeoff is worth it.  Besides, Samsung now includes software to shrink it for one-handed so you get the best of both worlds.There are 2 things that Samsung needs to improve in my opinion.  I don't know how many thousands of people need to tell them that putting the volume rockers directly opposite the power button is inconvenient  for users.  The Note 2 placement was better but still wrong.  (I do like the new speaker placement though.  Its perfect for horizontal viewing because your hand channels the sound to the user).This phone should also be waterproof right out-of-the-box.  Not a scaled-down version, just waterproof the thing.  Other manufacturers are doing it for their flagship phones.  That means Samsung can do it too.  Truth be known, we users never want to see another flagship phone that is not waterproof.  It's doable, so please do it.  Smoke it with that nano-whatever  waterproofing stuff.  You went to CES.  (Oh, and S voice is still sorry, use Google voice)All that said, I'm very, very, happy with the Note 3.  IMHO the Note 3 is so powerful and functional, it is the first device I would classify as a hand held computer.  As a professor, I researched it for days and used the original Galaxy Note for over a year now.  There are other good phones, but the Note 3 does it in one package, and in almost all cases does it better,  for the same flag-ship- phone price.  I feel sorry for the fanboys and people believing advertising  hype who don't research the market.  They pay top dollar but don't get their money's worth.  Amazon is a great place to get your money's worth and to find out user information.  Thanks Amazon.Oh yeah, almost forgot to mention, it's a really good phone too.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F33OE06" id="B00F33OE06-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-09:</strong> Been a Note 2 user for a long time.  When the Note 3 was announced, there were rumors that the phones were programmed for specific regions.  Meaning, SIM cards for that region worked on the units built for that region.  I thought that was a dumb move from Samsung if they did that.I got my unit from Amazon and have it shipped here in Manila, Philippines.  Stuck my local Telco sim card and it works.  Migration from the Note 2 to the Note 3 was a breeze.  It was done in a matter of less than an hour.  Only issue was migrating from the old S Note to the new S Note.  Other than that, am happy with this unit.  Power consumption seems to be better than the Note 2.

My friend and I picked up the Note 3 from TMobile here in America yesterday! It was very limited at certain stores. Now to the review.This phone has the highest and if not, tied for the highest spec for a smartphone out. 3GB of RAM, the closest phone has 2GB. The processor is tied with the Snapdragon 800 being used in a few high end Androids. The camera is amazing. Very clear and a lot of different options to chose from camera or recording. The screen resolution is amazing for a big phone. When I whip this bad boy out, it automatically catch peoples attention. You don't have to squint or zoom in. Things are that clear and big.Those are the pros. There are some cons, if you can call it that. My biggest complaint is - THERE ARE SOO MANY FEATURES & FUNCTIONS! I love this phone, don't get me wrong but I haven't had time to fully go through everything this phone has to offer. You can run 2 apps at the same time like Youtube and surf the internet. Name another phone or tablet that can do that? Take notes on a fly and have it sync with everything. This phone does it all but like I said, there's a lot to know about the phone which is a good and bad.The Note 3 is here to stay. The specs are up there so you won't need a replacement for a few years if you so choose. The battery life is ridiculous long. I left the house this morning with it full at 7:30 AM, have listened to music on my train ride back and forth, surfed the web and text my friends on and off. It is now 2:00 PM and my battery is like at 93%. I don't see how anyone can manage to drain this battery in 1 day if it wasn't intentional cause even with moderate use, that battery is lasting all day.I bought this device October 2, 2013 and if anyone has any question, please let me know and I'll gtt back to you as soon as possible</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F33OE06" id="B00F33OE06-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-24:</strong> WOW.

Otherwise, no.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009L25JKE" id="B009L25JKE-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-15:</strong> Very cute and fashionable.

I use an Android battery monitor app called Battery Monitor Widget Pro.  The app will compute the total energy that the battery will hold after multiple cycles of complete charge/discharge.  What I've found is that the Samsung OEM battery rated at 2100mah holds about 1450 mah's +/- 5%.  Another eBay 2900mah battery held about 1700mah's (junk). I'm still testing a Hyperion 4200mah battery, nothing conclusive.The EZOPower 2100mah battery actually holds 2156mah +/- 3% after about 8 charge cycles.  Pretty darn good!I don't work for or even know who EZOPower is, I just know that their batteries live up to the ratings, its the only battery I'll use.  Your mileage may vary.**** UPDATE  Battery lasted 5 months and the capacity dropped off rapidly.

The one I got looks slightly different than the battery that came with my GS3, but the difference is slight and the battery itself performs just as well as the GS3's original battery.  Whatever it is, it works well.And yes, it does work with the Verizon Galaxy S3.  No issues.UPDATE 05/31/2013: The batter was OK for the first day or so but afterward never got past about 80% charged, even when plugged in for hours.  The Samsung battery, just to compare, only takes about an hour to recharge.  So I suspect this replacement battery is certainly not the same thing. As a result, I am dropping my "stars" down to 1.  Fake?  Not sure.  But I am no longer using it.  Batteries that charge forever like that make me wonder if they have the proper safety circuits to keep it from overcharging.  When in doubt, and I have a doubt on this one, there is no way I would risk it.I will trudge out to a Verizon store and try to get a real Samsung battery.  It's a shame the real thing is so hard to find given that there are at least 40 million GS3s in use.  The spares should be everywhere.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089VO7OM" id="B0089VO7OM-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-28:</strong> This battery never full charges whether I charge it in the phone or not in the phone on a separate charger.

No where on here I can see a statement about this battery being used or anything other than brand new.  However, when I received it, it came in a paper bubble-envelope, with the battery itself in a plastic sleeve, which was itself in a small cardboard case; in other words, the battery did not come packaged in anything advertising it as a Samsung battery, nothing retail related, nothing like you might see for something that is NEW.  Further, based upon a few uses, this battery seems to perform worse than the battery that came with my S3 ... and that thing is approaching six months in age with hundreds of rechargings.When it comes down to it, for the price (less than a third of what you'd pay Samsung directly), this is a great deal ... not disputing that.  And even with the whole probably used aspect, the battery still holds (spitballing here) 70 to 80% of a charge compared to a factory-new battery.However, I'm dissatisfied that this is not made clear on the product page.  A simple REFURBISHED or a GENTLY USED somewhere would mitigate the less than great review I'm giving.EDIT: I've more or less confirmed that this battery never reaches full charge; when in the phone, charging, I've never seen it exceed a 87% charge capacity, and the red charge light never goes green.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089VO7OM" id="B0089VO7OM-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-27:</strong> Not as good as original battery life  however ,,, 1/3rd the cost.

What I discovered however is that when i charged it whilst in the phone (Galaxy s3) it freezes up my phone.... then it refuses to charge. My phone even failed to come on when i plugged in the wall charger at 6% life! I believe this is not the original battery and is soehow esses up my phone.  I haven't decided to return it yet because I really need an extra battery. My solution though is to spend the battery life and charge it on the portable wall charger that i bought.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089VO7OM" id="B0089VO7OM-review46" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-07:</strong> Bought it for a spare since I travel frequently, good price for OEM.

You can not really use the 4200mAh if you carve out the Otterbox for the 7000mAh.==============================================================================================THE OEM BATTER GIVES YOU AT BEST 6 HOURS.  WORST PHONE BATTER EVER DESIGNED, SOMEONE WAS PAID OFF ON THIS ONE. BUY A HYPERION 4200 mAh BATTERY TO MAKE THIS PHONE A WINNER FROM  GARBAGE.  WITHOUT A HYPERION 4200 mAh BATTERY THE PHONE IS USELESS GARBAGE. wITH THE HYPERION 4200 mAh BATTERY EXCEPT FOR NO ir THE PHONE ROCKS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I AM GOING TO TRY THE HYIPION 7000mAd, DON'T THINK I NEED THAT BIG, BUT ONE BIG, ONE WELL WILL NOT HURT.update: Just to be clear, the OEM battery shipped with the phone, made by Samsung does not power the phone properly. You will watch the percentage of battery left drop at as much as 20% per hour. I bought a second OEM battery when I bought my phone and they both perform the same, terribly. If you turn on your phone before noon you can count it will be dead well before your day ends. Have a school event that lasts all day and make sure you have two batteries.My third battery after much research is the HYPERION 4200mAh battery. It lasted 22 hours, 11 hours the first day and another 11 hours the second day. While this is only the second day of use the battery is a real battery, not like the OEM garbage I have been stuck with the last two months. The oem is underpowered and Samsung should be ashamed of themselves. the phone was made to be the smallest lightest phone in the world, but someone forgot the phone actually has to work for a full 11 hour day, not 6 hours per day.ADD in the FACT THAT MANY SAMSUNG BATTERIES ARE CONTERFIT and the OEM is crap ANYWAY why would anyone buy an OEM Samsung.Buy the extended battery case from ZeroLemon, the one with the door on the back to switch batteries, buy the two year warranty HYPERION 4200mAh or the 7000mAh, I like the 4200mAh and you have a slightly larger phone, that works ALL day. You can take an Otterbox and cut out a space for the battery, which will be the same as the ZeroLemmon with a slightly better feel. Both protect your phone the same, and I always put my phones in Otterbox cases when new, but the ZeroLemon is better with the door built in. as the ZeroLemon case allows the use of OEM battery with the door to hold them, or the HYPERION HIGH CAPACITY batteries.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089VO7OM" id="B0089VO7OM-review63" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-11:</strong> This battery seems to be a genuine OEM product.

After about 5 months of ownership, I must announce that said battery is deceased. I noticed that my phone was getting EXTREMELY HOT while charging the past few days and that the battery would drop 40-50% in a few hours even with the phone completely switched off. I took my Speck case off and noted that my cover popped right off, revealing a swollen (literally, the sides are convex), hot, and obviously defective battery. Luckily, I caught it before it could cause any damage. I called Samsung and their advice was to purchase another from Amazon.I would recommend buying this battery directly from Amazon.com, not from one of the third parties operating within Amazon. I originally did, and there is a chance that I received a fake battery.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089VO7OM" id="B0089VO7OM-review88" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-19:</strong> Was skeptical when I saw thisSamsung Galaxy S3 Replacement Battery (2100 mAh)for sale here at a fraction of what the original costs, but curiosity got the better of me, especially considering the fact that I knew it could be returned to Amazon if it didn't function properly. The fancy box from the OEM battery didn't matter as it would be thrown away, so I went for it.Upon receipt of the battery, checked the Samsung numbering carefully and found that the one that I received was the correct EB-L1G6LLA 2100mAh Li-ion battery matching the original from mySamsung Galaxy S III 4G Android Phone, and it was. Charged the battery in the phone, then ran the calibration routine usingBattery HD Pro. That can take up to 90 minutes, but it seemed to be a good thing from past experience.This battery is equipped with an NFC (Near Field Communication) antenna allowing the Galaxy S III to communicate with other devices and accessories equipped with NFC technology. Tested this with a compatible phone owned by a friend, and it worked just fine.This battery has turned out to be a good one so far, but if you get one of them, be sure that the numbers and the 2100mAh ratings match those of your original  Samsung Galaxy S III battery when you get it. Should I run into any problems with it, this review will be updated to reflect what I've found with it.1/19/2013</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089VO7OM" id="B0089VO7OM-review89" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-27:</strong> Arrived on time and worked.

It works as it should.  It holds the charge as well as the battery that came with my S3.  I use a few juice-guzzling features on my phone.  The extra battery came in handy when I had the unexpected opportunity to meet with friends for an outing.  I was charging my battery in my car but had only 35% charge when I got the news.  When I arrived at our rendezvous I quickly changed the battery.  I was able to capture the event with photos and video without concern of a dead battery.  I have made it a habit to keep the second battery with me and fully charged.  You never know when you&#8217;ll happen onto one of those once-in-a-lifetime photo opportunities.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089VO7OM" id="B0089VO7OM-review100" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-12:</strong> For the price It was a steal.

That's the real deal part of the battery.While the actual battery may not be counterfeit, the packaging it came in certainly was...

From all of the experience I've had with cellphones in the past, it makes sense.So far she has had it for about two weeks and reports that all is well. She's happy with the back up battery and this seems to have helped the original battery as well.

I bought this one because it appeared to be an OEM replacement, & was priced right. Wow, to my surprise, what a complete POS!  Wow, I find it very hard to believe that a brand new battery can last 1/2 as long as a 2 year old battery, but that's exactly what happened with this POS.I keep all radios off unless I need to use them, so I'm a conscious user of power. I live in an area with 3G only, so data drain is relatively speaking low. I went from 6 hours before needing to recharge with the 2 yr old battery, to 3 hours with the new one. Which makes me wonder one spells fake, defective, shyster, deceptive, crappy, junk, POS?

Simply always carry around a spare, charged battery and swap it out whenever I need too.  Usually once or twice a day at most.

I did a fully discharged and recharged to 100% overnight. Issue still persist.2) Battery drains out quickly without much use.I charged the battery overnight to 100% and took of charger at 8 AM.

One came with the phone, and the other came with my Samsung battery charger.This battery is different.  It may have the Samsung name branded on it, but it differs from my two OEM batteries in the following ways:1.  It takes longer to charge.2.  Once charged, it does not last as long.3.  The NFC does not work when I use this battery.  (in spite of it having NFC clearly marked on it)4.  The markings on the battery differ in subtle ways, and in places the writing has started to wear off.  (the other two batteries are identically marked and in spite of being older, the markings are still intact on both of them)5.  It does not have the little sticker that changes color if the battery gets wet.All of these things taken together tell me that this battery may be a counterfeit.I see from other reviews that my experience with this battery has been similar to many others.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089VO7OM" id="B0089VO7OM-review162" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-13:</strong> Can't imagine not having this extra battery!!

I doubt highly that these are genuine OEM batteries (or) if they are OEM, they are old batteries being sold as new.Ordered 2 of these $9.30 each from PacificCellularDistributor and fulfilled by Amazon. BOTH of them will not charge past 83% even when the phone is turned off completely and charged overnight.  As soon as you take it off charge, it would jump to 86% or so then within 5 minutes, go back down to less than 80% and drop quickly with normal use, much quicker than the 2 yr old original battery I was trying to replace.Amazon customer service offered to refund my purchase price and/or offered a replacement but they're offering me the same kind of product that I think this is. They sent me a link to a battery listed here for $3.01 each.  Really?  I highly doubt this will be any better than the ones I received so I'm going to take the refund.

Although the joggerz is a nice looking small bluetooth headset with "okay" sound and enough volume; I would have to rate it low because it has poor battery life and horrible build quality. I've had this for about 2 weeks and the right hard-plastic snapped in to two. I take care of my gear but for some reason this thing just broke and I have no idea how or why. I'm very disappointed. Also warning for people whose head are not tiny. The joggerz will indeed leave some pressure spot when used more than an hour./*Original review*/This is my second pair of "sports" Bluetooth headphones. I mainly use my headphones when I run and when I go to the gym.I'm going to compare this to my Soundbot SB240 which I love.First thing I notice out of the box was the size. The Jarv is really small compared to the ginormous SB240. With that said I don't look silly when I wear the Jarv. I love the Jarv's form factor. The size is right on. And it is much more aesthetically pleasing to the eye vs the SB240.Fit wise. I have a huge head and it's not tight at all. It's just right. So that's a good thing on my book.Sound is okay compared to my SB240. I'm not an audiophile or anything but I can really distinguish the sound more on my SB240. I love it when I can hear the tiniest note on my SB240. The Jarv is "okay" it's not punchy at all. It's more flat. I came into the conclusion that maybe sound was sacrificed because of the form-factor.The volume is also good. I'm able to drown the music at my gym and the people around me.The one thing that I'm not a big fan is the button placement. I can't seem to work the volume button properly. The volume and the skip/back button are integrated and is a pain. Every time I want to lower the volume all it does is skip. It's probably my fault but yeah I'm not a fan of the button placement. What I do now is manually adjust the volume on my phone. Problem solve.Over all this headphones are really good specially for the money. I would recommend it to anyone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00J43Y62C" id="B00J43Y62C-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-16:</strong> Bought these based on the reviews here.

So far, I have charged them up and connected them and used them for a little talk radio falling asleep.  This is really huge because they are so comfortable you can fall asleep with them on.  I am not pleased with the controls at all.  Very difficult but I dont plan on controlling very much so its not decisive for me.  I had the Motorolas when they first came out, They were torture.  You couldnt lie down, you couldnt do much but stand up with them.  The other comfort factor that is very important to me is the heat,  Surprisingly, little poorly made ear coverings can make one very hot!  a smothering sensation.  These did take a minute to get used to, but once I did, they were not claustrophobic or smothering in any way.  I especially like that they are not expensive or fragile.  I may order another pair.Update:  I did order another pair!  much to my chagrin, as soon as the new black pair arrived (which are really stunning) my pink ones went PFFFT.  Honestly,  when purchases become too laborious, I avoid them,  I dont want multiple contacts for a $20. purchase,  I dont have time for these really in depth reviews but for a few reasons I am breaking that rule for this Seller.I have been burnt really badly  by this Amazon 'third party' thing....a very Kafka-esque procedure surely only surpassed in torture by being drawn and quartered.  Sometimes, most of the time for me, I dont really know I am going off the reservation when I make one of these impulse purchases on the fly.  I dont do my due diligence. I dont have time to research but the deal is so appealing, heck!  I roll the dice!This was a good experience because I did have a problem and I did not go into the catacombs of customer service hell "They're not Amazon"  "They have their own rules".  all that stuff....yes, it was daunting.  Took all the fun out of impulse purchase and I stopped them for a good long time....actually going for "other' Deals of the Day that didnt involve outsiders.So ok, cutting to the chase, this is a Seller that does not make you jump through flaming email hoops over a basic customer service issue.  They are the same as Amazon to deal with, no months of emails,  being tossed back and forth like a wet flounder.Kudos.Thanks for my cool little gadgets.  Keep up the good work.  I deserve it.  I am a good customer :)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00J43Y62C', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00J43Y62C', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B005G0DEQQ</h2>    <p class="price"> $B005G0DEQQ</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

I suppose it would add a couple bucks to the price. As things stand, one must perform this task oneself. Fortunately, the screens have gotten easier to put on, thanks mostly to the little tabs they stick on the ends so you can peel away the film from the sticky side without going insane. Given what you paid for your phone, I highly advise you get some sort of screen protector for it. Spend the time to put it on right, get the little air bubbles out, and then forget it's there. Because if you do this right, it really doesn't effect your use of the phone at all. If find mine to be just as responsive as before. Good luck.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G0DEQQ" id="B005G0DEQQ-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-01:</strong> Belkin Screen Overlay for Samsung INfuse 4G phone.  I really like this screen protector. I got it for my iPod and had to trim the sceen protector to fit the iPod, but it is very easy to install and remove if necessary. It might take a few tries to get the screen protector on straight without any bubbles showing. Since it is a cling rather than an adhesive, there is no residue if you remove the screen protector. I have not trouble pressing on the iPod and the touch screen works with the screen protector just fine. I was amazed at how much difference it makes. Fingerprints wipe right off with the cloth provided. I would recommend this screen protector for any iPod or Samsung  phone user.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G0DEQQ" id="B005G0DEQQ-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-22:</strong> There's not much to these screen protectors. The most important thing is that the bubbles go away eventually.The problem is that mine didn't go away. It's not so bad. And maybe I didn't apply it properly. But the directions are a little confusing - there are 2 sticky tabs and I thought it didn't matter which tab I remove first. But maybe it does, not sure.Also, for those who are curious, this won't fit the Samsung Galaxy S2.On the plus side, it comes with a nice cloth for cleaning.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G0DEQQ" id="B005G0DEQQ-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-25:</strong> First off, I messed up and ordered this when I actually had a Galaxy S2. I thought for some reason this would fit and it doesn't. My fault not the products.But I got it anyways and applied it. I first noticed the Infuse screen protectors are larger then my phone by a little bit. I got a pair of scissors and trimmed it down to fit and still this screen protector was a piece of cake to put on. I had a few air bubbles but these protectors come with a cardboard stiff squeegee and the bubbles came right out.Really it's hard to review one of these, I'm not going to scratch my phone with keys, etc but the application was easy, it doesn't take away from the brightness of the screen like some matte protectors I've had before. I'm very happy with this and getting 3 for the price is a great deal.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005G0DEQQ" id="B005G0DEQQ-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-02:</strong> I did not realize when I chose this from vine that it did not fit the iPod without custom trimming needed. The product description is only 8 words: "Easily attaches to the screen of your iPod" so I assumed it would fit the phone like a glove also because they are essentially the same type of device. Regardless, I was able to trim them to size easily enough so not a big deal. Application of these types of static overlays takes a little practice to get on nicely without any bubbles and when done right these are crystal clear. Very nice! My biggest problem is the price. 15 is not unheard of but is still a bit high for my tastes. These are by far the clearest overlays that I have used. I use a light touch on my phone and do not carry it in my pants pocket so I typically get well over several months of use from one overlay. In addition to these overlays a good otterboxOtterboxwill round out a nice protection scheme for any iPhone.So bottom line, If you own the Samsung that these were designed for this would be a great solution. The custom fit and clarity make these a great choice.If you own the apple pod/phone I would go with theAT&T; iPhone 3G 3GS Mirrored Screen Protector - 3 Packor theiPhone 4/4s MIRRORED Screen Protector depending on your style of phone.I received this product free of charge to try through the vine program.Would I spend my own money on this?

First of all, while you do have to exercise some caution applying the screen protectors is relatively easy.  Secondly, they come clean without a lot of dirt and dust trapped underneath.  And finally, they do not interfere or hinder the touch screen interface.  So in every basic way, these protectors seem to be working out so far.CONCLUSIONI will have to see how the edges hold up over time.

The magnetic closure has not interfered with my iPhone in any way, and the belt loops make this holster very, very secure. The phone is easily removed when needed. I bought this to replace theDLO Leather Holster Case for iPhone 3G, 3G S (Black), when the belt clip began to become loose; if you want to make SURE that you never loose your iPhone because of a lost holster, the PC Microstore holster with belt clip AND belt loops is the way to go. I had the unfortunate experience of losing a Motorola Razr when another holster's belt clip slipped off my pocket; an honest person turned the phone in, but not before it had been stepped on and the glass front broken. Do you really want to risk losing your Iphone in such an accident? At the offering price, I feel that this iPhone case is one of the best deals available on all of Amazon's web site.Follow-up, December 2009-My wife recently upgraded to an iPhone, so I ordered two more of these cases, still at a great price. While they seemed very similar to the items I received in August, they are of MUCH poorer quality- the belt loops broke in a mere three weeks of usage. I have contacted pcmicrostore about a refund or replacement through Amazon, and I'm waiting for their response. The cases received in November have a small logo on the front, but the ones I received in August did not. I have resumed use of the case received in August, which is somewhat worn and with stretched belt loops that are nevertheless still intact. It seems as though pcmicrostore has changed suppliers, without bothering to let Amazon (or anyone else, for that matter) know that they had done so. I can no longer recommend this phone case because of its poor workmanship.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001CJTE0K" id="B001CJTE0K-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-07-08:</strong> The holster is too big for the iphone (3G) and does not have a snug fit.

Nice texture. I had no unususal odors and the magnetic latch works well.The only down side I see is that because of the shape of the iPhone is may be easy to drop the phone when removing it from the case. Removing the phone is easy but the iPhone has no texture to make grabbing it secure. I've not tried adding a skin to the iphone to see if this helps, the iPhone may not fit in the case with the skin attached.Bottom line- at $2.98 this is a steal & money well spent.BTW: keep credit cards and other things with magnetic ID strips on the back away from the magnetic latch or the information on the card will be lost.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001CJTE0K" id="B001CJTE0K-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-06-13:</strong> This is a pretty good case, especially for the price.  It does have some drawbacks though.I started with a DLO case for my iPhone.DLO Leather Holster Case for the iPhone 3G(Black)It was perfect:  Thin (close to the body), access to the headphone port while the phone was in the case, and a big hole in the bottom to push the phone up out of the case.  That turned out to be a big key in how much I liked the case.  It was very easy to get the phone out with one hand.  The only issue I had with the DLO was that it had velcro to close the case.  I use my phone as my watch.  So, it was distracting in meetings to hear that "rip" every time I wanted to check the time.So I tried this case.  The magnetic closure works well and it's quite.  It does have both a belt clip and belt loops--which added to the bulk and made the phone stick out more from my hip.  The biggest drawback (and why I'm looking at yet another case) is the the flap is too big and the hole use to push up the phone is too small.  So, it is difficult to get the phone out with one hand.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001CJTE0K" id="B001CJTE0K-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-04-15:</strong> I must've lucked out and gotten two of these (a second one a few months after the first one was ordered) that looked like the original picture; tan on the inside and black leather on the outside. Two elasticized side-end panels allow for a good fit (although my second one was a bit snugger than the first).The second one fit the iPhone 2G (no skin) perfectly, but not a 3GS with a Thermo Plastic Urethane--too tight. The first case, although outwardly the same as the first, was a bit looser in fit that allowed the 3GS to fit with a TPU skin just snugly enough.So it appears that the supplier varies and it sometimes is the luck of the draw as to what you get and how well it fits. This is probably the only reason I would give it 4 instead of 5 stars--lack of quality control or a consistent supplier.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001CJTE0K" id="B001CJTE0K-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-05-28:</strong> I ordered the horizontal leather iPhone case indicated here.  The seller shipped extremely quickly - I think I had it within 3 days of ordering.  The case is as advertised; leather, with a good fit for the iPhone 3G.  The case allows you to use headphones to listen to music without taking the phone from the case - nice convenience feature.  It connects to the belt through either a clip or through built-in belt loops.  If you're worried about losing the phone if you just use the clip, don't - it's so tight it's a pain in the a55 to remove it from the belt.  I'm ordering a couple of different configurations just to test out my options, but I could see coming back to this one.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001CJTE0K" id="B001CJTE0K-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-07-12:</strong> This fits my iPhone perfectly, and I already have an Incipio silicon sleeve that I keep it in permanently.  It's a little snug with the sleeve, but easy enough to put in and take out.  There are 2 belt loops, that I don't use, and one belt clip that I do use.  The belt clip seems sturdy enough.When I bought this, it was $2.98 with no s&h.;  This certainly isn't worth a whole lot more than that, but it's a great value for the price.  I'd actually be willing to pay up to $7.00 for it.  It's not too bulky, at least not more than a holster should be.  The magnet keeps it closed.  It stays on my belt just fine, and it's sturdy enough to keep the iPhone safe for a short drop, especially with the silicon sleeve.

There is a clip in the center of the case with loops on either side of it to attach to a belt. It can only be worn in the horizontal position only, I prefer vertical. The clip is not very strong & will work itself free of the belt. I used to loops to prevent my phone from escaping (strange how they always manage to find a pool of water to dive into), but the loops broke after a few weeks.

The leather that holds the side closed came apart and the leather on the belt clip had started coming apart 5 months ago. (Marware would not replace it under their lifetime warranty)I liked the looks of the Marware case, but hated to spend another $35 plus shipping for something that was going to last only 5-6 months. So I decided to try this case for $2.76 plus $3 shipping.This case seems more stiff than the Marware. The leather is more "textured"  (as seen in the product photo) and the sides seem to have elastic stretch spot between the leather on the side pieces as opposed to the Marware. The Marware CEO interior is a dark grey felt and this one has a tan leather (same texture as outside) interior.My 3G is in a Griffin shell style case and fits snugly in this case with a little room to spare. The belt clip seems to firm. The magnet in this case seems larger than the Marware and holds well.Overall I am extremely happy with the looks and the price of this product compared to the marware version.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001CJTE0K" id="B001CJTE0K-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-19:</strong> Good case but bulky and too tight on the phone.

I was thrown off by its price. I tried other, more expensive cases like DLO, Belkin, CaseMate and Griffin. None came close to the look and quality of this case. I'm not sure why its so cheap, but they've got a good thing going here. I'm amazed how real the "pleather" looks and feels.One of the reviews mentioned that the case was overly tanned and the smell was overwhelming. This was true for about two days. The smell is completely gone now. I really like the fact that its a magnetic closure. This was my biggest complaint with the DLO case. Its looks were great, but who wants to rip open a big velcro strap in the middle of a meeting to get your phone out.I have my iPhone in a Shield poly case (also highly recommended) to keep it from getting scratched when its not in the case. The iPhone with the poly case fits nicely into the holster. It requires just the right amount of force to get the phone out.I've only had this case for a couple of weeks now, but it looks like it will hold up well.

I got the first one for $2.99 and my wife and I liked it so much that we ordered 4 more for friends and for when these wear out - which her $30 AT&T; store version is already doing after a year too.  It has a clip, magnet closing flap and beltloops so it can be used just about any way you like.  It is big enough to handle an iphone with a hardcase on it as well.  Although that does get a little tight.  But not unusable if you use the beltloops to hold it in place.  I paid $3.28 for the second batch.  I still considered that a deal.  Free shipping in both cases.  Fast, and well packaged.  I can't say enough good about these!P.S.  They do have openings for earphones to be plugged in while the phone is in the carry case, but not for the power cord.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001CJTE0K" id="B001CJTE0K-review49" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-03-17:</strong> i have it, is good. the product has good quality. i think is excellenti want to know why the price is so low.people, take advantage of it.do it!!!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001CJTE0K" id="B001CJTE0K-review50" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-30:</strong> Wonderful product that worked great for the life of my 3GS phone.

I can fit my iPhone 16gb in here no problem, even with a silicone skin on it.  I plan on using it primarily for listening to music, and can definitely fit the headphones in with the case closed.  One thing to note - the case has a small + kind of shape embossed on the front right corner, which is not pictured.  This was actually a very pleasant surprise, as I think it looks even more "expensive" with this touch.  In addition, I haven't experienced any problem at all getting the phone out of the holster.  The case feels and looks a lot more expensive than it is, and because I can put my phone in there WITH another protective case on it, it's perfect.  Till now I was holding off on getting theDLO Jam Jacket with Cord Management for iPod nano 3G (Black)for dealing with my headphones, since I also wanted a belt clip for added stability.  I think there would be no problem fitting both the iPhone and the JJ case in this holster.  Good product, awesome price, doesn't *look* like cheesy or like a "bargain" at all.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001CJTE0K" id="B001CJTE0K-review55" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-10:</strong> its ok s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s sssssssssssssssssssss sssssssssss ssssssssssss sssssssssss s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s s sssssssssssssss</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001CJTE0K" id="B001CJTE0K-review56" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-07-26:</strong> It worked great at first.

Some people seem to think they do, some don't. I noticed none of the cases on the Apple website have magnets. But what I couldn't find, was a belt clip case that would fit a phone with a skin on it, except for this one. I didn't want to spend $50 on a case from the Apple website to find out it wouldn't work. Of course I had already ordered this case when I found out about the magnet conspiracy.So for $7 with shipping, I decided to give this a try. But I didn't want to fry my phone with a $7 case. So I cut the magnets out and bought some 3M Velcro stickers with "permanent" adhesive. I put the velcro over the spots where the magnets were. So far they work great. I imagine they will need replacing over time.I have an iFrogz case on my phone, and it fits in this case just fine. Snug but not too snug. I don't think the phone would fall out with the flap wide open. The clip is very secure, I don't see it falling off, but I like the security of the belt loops.Quality seems to be good enough for this price range. This case with velcro would be perfect.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001CJTE0K" id="B001CJTE0K-review60" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-02-17:</strong> It is marketed as being for the iPhone, but it is actually a universal case.  My Samsung Eternity fits perfectly in the leather pouch once I put the hard rubberized cover on the phone.  The leather is great quality, the price is unbeatable, and it works great.  The belt clip is a little small, but holds just fine on around 1" belts.

Started to have a couple of tears where the flap folds and i can clearly see that it's not leather. Also the seams where the opening at the bottom has come apart and also reveals synthetic materials. It's starting to look old, so I'm looking for a real leather one. The hole doesn't line up for my phone.

They perform the same functions, and I will use this review as a comparison between the two.Pros:Have an adjustable ear clip to accomodate those with "longer" ears.  This is not necessarily an issue for me.The in-ear speakers are not silicone "buds" that you shove into your ear.  They are plastic and they are meant to sit outside the ear.  I think that because of this they draw more power from the mp3 player and are much louder than the SF200s.  Although they are not as comfortable as the silicone buds, they don't pop out of place like the buds do.The microphone/button function the same as the SF200s, with a single button for call answer/pause (1-click), and next/previous track (2-click, 3-click).The microphone picks up audio very well.Cons:The headphones are made of cheap flimsy plastic.  This must be where the $7 difference is between this product and the SF200s.  I don't know how long they'll last. I've had the SF200s for a year now and have been through many many hours sweat and rain.  I don't know if the JVCs will hold up as long, but we'll see.The 3.5mm jack is straight, as opposed to angled.  Thus, it sticks out of players much farther than an angled chack, such as that of the SF200.  This isn't "bad" in any way, but if I were ever pressed for space near a headphone jack, these most likely won't fit.If you were to ask me if I would prefer the SF200s or the JVCs, I'm not sure which I would choose.  Probably the JVCs since they are $7 cheaper, and I really did not like the fit of the SF200s in my ear - the silicone would always come loose and pop out while I was running.  Furthermore, fresh ear wax would build up inside of the buds, and the JVCs don't have that problem.  However, the SF200s are entirelly cased in flexible silicone/rubber material (even the wire), so there is no worry of something cracking or breaking.  I only replaced them because they got a little too wet one day and the button signal would send to the player at random times, pausing my music or skipping to the next/previous track uncontrollably.  If the SF200s would switch from the silicone earbuds towards the plasic ones that won't pop out, then I would definitely switch back.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0078JFQ6Y" id="B0078JFQ6Y-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-15:</strong> These headphones are surprisingly comfortable, the sound is perfectly decent, they stay in *really* well when I'm working out, and the cord doesn't tangle nearly as much as with other small headphones.

The price is low so I can't really be mad, but they advertise &#34;anti-scratch layer&#34; of film on this screen protector. Well, the mirror part does work quite well. With the screen off you can see yourself (and what's behind you) when you're out in public. Catch people spying on you? Trying to evade the police? These will help. HOWEVER, like I said about the &#34;anti-scratch layer&#34;---- my screen protector has a million little nicks and scratches all OVER the thing. I thought this thing was supposed to be scratch-proof/resistant? Hardly. Protector fits screen perfectly, that's a plus. It took me a couple tries to line up the thing before I got it just right. I was very happy with it for the first couple weeks I had it but then I started to notice all these little scratches showing up. Just about anything will leave a scratch on the protector- but nothing so far has gone thru and scratched my actual screen of my iPhone. I've had better protectors that were non-mirror & the kind of rubbery feeling sort of material that is more &#34;scratch resistant&#34; than this material. I gave this product a 3 because its cheap, mirror works good, perfect fit for iPhone 5, but they scratch really easily. I guess that's why they give you 3 in a pack because the life span of the protector is short- unless you like looking at your screen thru a million scratches.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008THTP3O" id="B008THTP3O-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-05:</strong> I don't know what the other reviewer that gave it one-star, but I found this mirror protector to be the best one.  I used another competitor mirror protector, and the edges would start to peel a few hours after application.The tech armor stuff does not do this, it does not have a brownish tint, it's mirror, and the color out of the screen through the mirror finish is not distorted.  The competitor mirror protector gave my iphone a greenish tint on the screen when it was on, this one did not (just check the white and black color when you turn on your retina display).I hate it when people use this and don't know what they are talking about, this is my last and final screen protector, I went through four different ones since I got my iphone 5 two months ago.  This is by far the best and most reliable one.Remember, when you buy other brands, the reason why the edges peel is because, the screen protector is stretching and deforming, therefore, unable to keep flat, so when you apply it on your screen the edges flare.  This screen protector is just thick enough that it did not deform when you peel back the protective film before applying, and not too thick that it makes the screen look like it has a layer over it...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B008THTP3O', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B008THTP3O', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B009PYUPS4</h2>    <p class="price"> $B009PYUPS4</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

Its very convenient for me to be able to carry all my essentials in one package. The stitching seems to be holding well as is the magnetic closure. I do have two minor gripes though:1- Its a bit difficult to remove the phone from the case, it feels like the opening around the power button gets caught on the button which worries me about wear and tear over time. To fix this I cut the upper portion of the power button opening to allow the phone to be removed without rubbing the power button.2- Getting to the stylus is a pain with this case on. I eventually will attempt to use a craft knife to make my own opening but for the time being its very frustrating to attempt to remove the stylus.Overall, a great case for a great price.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006PABOKO" id="B006PABOKO-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-03:</strong> this is a great protection for whomever tends to have his phone in his pockets. it's light and sturdy, keeping your screen protected, while allowing as well you to view any movie or browse the internet without having to keep the computer in your handS.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006PABOKO" id="B006PABOKO-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-19:</strong> Not sure if it is real leather or not,but it looks good!!!!Finishing is top notch.This case is basically a snap on hard plastic case (which completely covers the phone's sides, but not so the top and bottom) wrapped with a leather like material on the outside. A screen flap is stitched to the leather covered plastic case.This cover's weak point, is the exposed top and bottom parts, but, if protection and a professional or elegant look is the goal, this cover will deliver.  For field, or active work, I would prefer an all around sides cover.This case uses two magnet strips to keep the flap securely closed: one in the flap, the other on the tab. I tested the magnet in the flap and found its magnetic "field" or "force" is stronger on the upper side, away from the phone than on the lower side, into the phone. On the lower part of the flap, the magnetic force is very weak almost imperceptible!!!Given its price, this cover is a bargain!!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B006PABOKO" id="B006PABOKO-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-08:</strong> This is a nice case.

They sync quickly with all 5 of my bluetooth devices. Have been very robust after 6 months of constant use. Did have them stop working one time and I just held a few buttons down and they &#34;rebooted&#34; and worked fine.The battery rating is completely legit. I can get a solid 10 hours of use out of these no problem.I wear them for my weight lifting workouts and have jogged with them, but the ring or necklace portion - not the ear buds, will bounce unless there is some way to hold them down. Kind of annoying but still workable. Occasionally the buds will pop out of my ears. Rather have that then the type that squish my head in and do not have good range.The sound is good enough for me to hear nuanced foreign languages, and music sounds good - not super rich or filled with highs or lows, but good enough to enjoy.These are an extremely clever addition to blue tooth headphone technology and LG knocked the design and execution out of the ballpark.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-12:</strong> I've been using the LG Tone Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset for months and I love it!

I have always used them as a hands-free device to connect to my phone. I thought that I would try this headset in order to get both Bluetooth stereo for music and remote voice connections with my smartphone which I use both as an MP3 player and, of course, a phone.Music sounded very good on this headset--as good as a pair of $12.00 ear buds that I usually use for this purpose.  However, when using it as a head set, it was only fair.  Callers sounded as if they were in a cave (I could hear a slight echo).  In addition, due to the ear bud, sound was sealed off; that is, ambient noise in the environment was reduced considerably.  T^his was a positive feature for music, but I felt it was a negative for a head set.The ergonomics were not great: although the neck band stays firmly in place, the earbuds which are attached with thin wires, tended to get caught on seat belts, etc,. and got pulled out of my ears occasionally.Bottom Line: Four stars as a Bluetooth stereo earphone device, but only two as a hands-free head set.  If you want to use it primarily to listen to music via a wireless connection, its a good product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-12:</strong> Got this for Christmas, and it's great.  The only BT headset I've found that works with a motorcycle helmet.  Since the controls are around the collar, I can still change songs or volume (unless I'm wearing gloves, but that's not the device's fault).Good sound on the phone.  It's SO helpful in a noisy environment to have the caller's voice in both ears.  People say I sound great from their end (much better than using the phone's microphone).Good music sound, too.  Well, at least as good as it could sound considering the compression of .mp3 compounded by the compression of bluetooth.  Hi-fidelity it ain't, but I wasn't expecting it to sound like a really nice pair of wired headphones patched into my home stereo.Works well with all media on the phone, except that my ringtones don't come through.  It just beeps its standard beep.  But I haven't found a headset that actually plays my ringtones yet, so I don't knock off a star for that.However, I do almost knock it down to 4 stars since I can't find a way to turn off the flashing blue light that says it's paired with a phone.  The manual doesn't mention it and the internet hasn't been helpful either.  I'm thinking that LG overlooked that option.  My Motorola earpieces have all had the choice, and I really miss it.  I don't want to be noticed for the silly blue light that everyone can see but me.  And the orange tips are really lame.  As with the silly blue light, I have no use for the gaily colored ends.

I know, Ive lost a few BT earpieces)So one ear, two ear stereo, havent tried with the PS3 yet. These earphones rule!UPDATE: 12/30/12A year plus later and they still work perfectly.

Although I have a pretty good case for the phone, it was a matter of time before something bad was going to happen. Also, it was my third wired headset from line breakage near the plug. So I did a lot of research and decided to try the LG HBS 700. I mainly listen to podcasts and some music but still wanted to retain the ability to use the phone. This unit met all those needs. The bluetooth pairing is fast and simple. The earbuds are comfortable, the controls are easy to feel and use (one you know what all the buttons do). and I hardly notice any weight around my neck. I've had this for a month and have had no issues with it. My only concern at this point is durability. For now, I give it 5 stars.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-13:</strong> I bought a pair of these headphones for use in my walking and jogging exercise routines. I use them with an iPhone 4s. Mine seem to skip out the audio a fair amount. I suspect this may have something to do with GPS. That's what comes to mind anyway. I don't really know why they drop audio. I could try them with GPS off and see what happens just to see.Aside from the above, I'm someone who buys the Apple headphones with the play/pause forward/backward mic on the cable so I can skips songs, talk to Siri or make/receive a call. However, when you constantly jog or do intense cycling with the Apple ear-buds it seems to me that a little sweat on those headphones kills the controls. They just flat out stop working. I can say that I order them from Amazon a lot. I tend to buy 4 replacement headphones at a time, which gets expensive. I carry an extra pair in my laptop bag. I have a few extra pairs at the office and home. Just yesterday another pair died on me.So anyway...  my thinking is to go wireless. If I sweat on these there is nowhere for it to go really. When you see the image of these you'll understand. Today I did 2 miles run and then a 1,500 foot incline over 3 miles. Get my heart rate as high as 163. Having the right music keeps me going. Any the last thing I want is something that feels awkward and takes me out of my oneness with the road, the wind and my workout. These headphones are almost invisible to my attention. The collar goes pretty much unnoticed. And the cables going from the collar to the ear buds are long enough that you can twist your head in any direction without ever feeling a wire touch your neck.Back to Apple's ear buds for a second. One of the biggest problems with ear buds, is that as you jog your arms sway in and out building momentum for your body. Wired ear bud cables can sometimes get yanked right out of your ear when the cable gets in the path of a swaying fist. And this of course isn't a pleasant feeling. It happens at home too. Once in a while I pass an open door and find my ear yanked hard because the cord of a head phone gets caught on the passing doorknob.Don't like the seemingly random cutting out, but I'll take that over corded headphones. Maybe someone should make WiFI sport headphones for joggers. It was actually pretty difficult to find a pair of headphones that looked like they'd be suitable for jogging.  So far these seem the most suitable.Update 8-11-2012I have changed from the iPhone 4s to the Samsung Galaxy SIII. And guess what... The headphones don't cut out anymore. Well, as long as I leave the phone in an arm holster, the signal is strong. I find that if I put the phone in my back pocket, then the headphones cut out. And standing close to a microwave oven also causes drop outs.I'm now using these headphones for running, the trip to and from work and walking. I upgraded my rating from 3 stars to 5 stars.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-31:</strong> If you want a real headset an not just an earpiece, then this headset is your best bet.The neck harness is so comfortable, you will forget it is even there.

I typically use my headphones for physical activities like running and cycling; and I already have a pair that stay in my ears while doing that (previously my only criteria). But since the giver was very excited about them I thought I'd give them a try. I've had them a week and I've found it hard to put them down since. It's amazing how liberating it is not to have a wire. I keep having to remind myself that I can just walk away from my phone, or I don't have to unplug my headphones when I get off the bike.Pros so far:-Battery power. My initial charge seemed to last forever! Then it only took about an hour to recharge.-Distance. I find it has pretty decent distance. In my office I can go just about anywhere with zero interference (about 1800 sq ft but it is mostly "open" space with few walls). At my house I left my phone in my car parked in my driveway, went inside my house about 20 feet and it still worked fine. This will really depend on what's in between you and your phone but for the most part you're pretty free.-Everything it can do! Part of this is because I have an iphone 5S but I'm very impressed with all that I can do without touching my phone, including having it read my texts or emails. Requires no setup or special app, just push the phone button and say "read my texts", after reading it Siri will ask you if you want to reply and she'll accept dictation. Speech seems to be very clear through the headset. Previously I didn't have much use for Siri, now I'm using it all the time. If you're like me and don't utilize it much, I'd suggest Googling everything Siri can do.-Noise canceling. These headphones work well to cancel out background noise. Almost a little too well, so I only wear one ear bud while at work.-Comfort. I thought it'd be awkward to have these around my neck all day but I forget that it is there.My one complaint, is that for me these won't stay in my ears during a high impact workout, like running. They seem fine for everything else including the gym, elliptical and cycling. Maybe I just have funny ears :) But I'll probably stick to my headphones that wrap around my ears for my runs. I can handle that. I'm glad someone else realized how much I would love these.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review22" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-12:</strong> Was working really good but now one side of the headset goes in and out.

The fit of the ear pieces is just a good a most earbuds.  The bluetooth connection seems to be made rather easily and the battery-life is an absolute ton of time.  I like that the little orange ends of the headset are magnetic and can hold the earbuds easily for storage.The one flaw is that there is no native way to keep the headset from falling off while on your back (bench press, sit ups, etc.).  I bought a $.60 eye glasses lanyard and used a could of knots to make a sliding loop and an adjustable length.  It is not the most attractive apparatus, but effective and it never falls off now, and is not heavy enough for me to notice any pull on the front of my neck.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-08:</strong> This headset is great.  Very good sound, very durable and very affordable.  The controls are pretty simple to use and I can easily listen to my desktop PC or Transformer Prime or android phone.  They are worth what you spend on them as they work really well......Unless you're at the gym and then they will fall off of your neck any time you are leaning or lying back.  Incline or flat bench (or similar) they are falling off.  Hop around too much and they will come off.  Lean back in your chair with your hands behind your head and they will come off.If there was some kind of connecting lanyard or something like that across the two ends then I think that would solve the problem.  Better yet, a band that goes around your neck connecting with velcro.  It wouldn't have to be tight and yet could keep the electronics secure.  Add a bit more noise cancellation and you would really have something special!But, if you aren't jogging or bike riding or in the gym then these bluetooth earbuds are worth every penny.  I will be getting another pair of these soon as a matter of fact.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-25:</strong> I hate Bluetooth headsets.I've tried Plantronics, Jawbone, Motorola, and others.  In ear, on ear, hanging over your ear, you name it.  The problem with ears is that everyone's ears are different, and despite being similar, the generic earpieces all suck for my ears.  Beyond that, the biggest drawback for Bluetooth headsets that I found was battery life.  If I'm working for eight hours and my earpiece dies after three, I'm out of luck.  For the longest time I relegated myself to using corded earbuds with my phone, because it was the only thing that was comfortable that I could wear for a long period of time.  For ages, I wished that I could find something as comfortable as my earbuds without the hassle and frustration of a cord and a plug tying me to my phone.Enter LG, and their remarkable invention, the LG Tone.  I ordered this item in August of 2012, and I've been using it each and every day since it arrived.  The earbuds are soft and comfortable, and it arrived with a variety of sizes for varying ear canals.  I use my headset at work to listen to streaming audio, and although the advertised battery life is ten hours of use, I frequently get much more.  The controls are easy to use, and despite its size, once the collar is resting around your neck it's barely noticeable, and light as a feather.  I even wear it when running and working out at the gym without any problems.  Bluetooth range is exceptional, allowing me to walk thirty feet or more from my phone before I experience any interruption in signal.Without question, I will never buy another traditional Bluetooth headset again.  Thank you, LG.  I've recently ordered a LG Tone+ for use with my laptop computer while at home, freeing me from yet another cord.pros:  Amazingly comfortable; easy to use; comfortable earbuds; spectacular battery life. durable. great sound and microphone response.cons:  the gauge of wire for the earbuds could be a heavier gauge, though I have experienced no problems after more than 1,700 hours of use.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review26" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-04:</strong> I use this mainly to listen to Audiobooks on my Nexus 7 and 10. Is it pairs very easily with either. The audio quality is clear and smooth. The controls are intuitive and easy to use and you can easily adjust the volume controls, play/pause, and fast forward and reverse. It lies comfortably around your neck and the short, but adjustable, earbud cords reach  perfectly to your ears.The soft silicone earbuds fit very comfortably and are supplied in 2 sizes: small and medium. The earpieces are magnetically held to the ends of the lightweight neckpiece for storage, which essentially prevents the rats nest tangle of wired headphones. I've used a dozen other earphones and I'm always struggling with the wiring. Listening to 1000's of hours of audio books and podcasts this is a constant problem. It's great not to have to deal with it chords any more and I can move around the room freely without having to carry the tablet all the time.The rubbing noise that you always get from cords on earphones does not exist with these. It makes a great difference in the audio experience and is one reason why the perceived audio quality is superior.There's a blue LED that blinks every 5 seconds to indicate the bluetooth is functioning. It's a bit bright at night so I simply put the neckpiece on upside down.The battery life is stated as 10 hours. All in all, I'm extremely pleased with this item.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-01:</strong> Love this thing.

Like spinning around in my chair at work, walking around outside, doing chores around the apartment.  So you can imagine that wired headphones can get annoying really quickly.  While there are lots of bluetooth headphones out there, I wear glasses, which means that ear-bud headphones are most comfortable for me.  The ear-bud types are really rare, and the ones I have found (aside from these) tend to be of very poor quality according to reviews, or they are more expensive than I would like.These LG headphones are relatively cheap, and they are high quality.  I have been using them for about a week now, and I think I can easily say that they are the best headphones I have ever owned.  Previously, thePhilips SHE6001/28 In-Ear Headphones Surround Sound (White)were my "gold standard", since they could take my abuse and deliver great sound.  This LG headset has, at the least, comparable sound quality and is well constructed.  I am convinced that it will be able to survive everything I can throw at it!  Not that I would intentionally abuse a fine piece of electronics like this, I'm just very... "accident prone".I have only used it with my Droid Razr, but the sound quality for music playback and calling is great.  It was easy to pair with the phone, and it beeps to let me know when it has connected to the phone after I turn the headset on.Pros:-Durable-Great audio quality-Incredibly small learning curve-Easy pairing (at least on an Android phone)-Built in cord/ear-bud management-Roughly 20-24hrs of battery life based on playing music, making phone calls, and turning the head set off when I am not using it-Awesome range (like 30-50ft)-Great value for what you getCons:-Not free-You may forget you are still wearing it at times-When the battery starts to die, it doesn't beep or anything to let you know, your music/calls will just start to stutter and go in/out and the phone button will blink until you figure out that its the battery and not interference-It would be nice if the ear-bud cords retracted into the bigger parts, instead of having to use the loop dealies to keep them controlled</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review29" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-06:</strong> Will be purchasing another pretty soon.

But I had to try since this headset is so versatile that it can replace all of my ear buds / headsets for portable devices and my laptop! It works well for stereo music and phone conversation for my Android phone. It works good for my iPad as well for music. I'm also really enjoying using it with my PlayStation Vita. In all cases the stereo sounds quite good, even better than many wired headset at this price range. Doing phone calls in stereo is also quite refreshing. If I want to hear outside, I'll just use one ear bud.At first I was concerned about using this for jogging and mountain biking, as I would be conscious about having something around my neck. But that turned out to be non issue. It's also very light.Despite having 6 buttons and a on/off switch, remembering them took less than few seconds! This is because the grouping of buttons on each side are very logical. Changing volume and forward/rewind songs make sense.One thing we often taking for granted is the ease of switching connection with varies devices. This one is capable of pairing with multiple devices. I was able easily switch between my Android and Vita.I highly recommend this product, event though it already has the overwhelming positive reviews. It's funny looking, but it's fun to wear knowing I can use just one headset for multiple electronic portable devices.*UPDATE* After having it for almost 1 year, I can say it's the best I ever had for 30 years! I use it every day for both phone and playing music.

Music and calls worked without problems. There were just a few features that I would have liked to have on this headset though. I found out from the LG live chat rep there's no way to see how much battery is left...see the conversation below:Guest: Hi I just received my LG Tone HBS-700Guest: and have a few questionsGuest: Am I able to check the battery status some how?Guest: and how long does it take to fully charge?Guest: and can it be used while chargingJermel: 1. no to the first question.Jermel: It should take as long as it will show the fully charged light.Guest: so once the light is blue?Jermel: And it is not recommend to be used while charging.Guest: okGuest: Is there a warning sign when the battery is low?Jermel: You will start to notice that the quality of the calls are not the same.Guest: thats it?Guest: no flashing lights?Guest: or anything of that kindJermel: Unfortunately not.I am sure I need to live down the hype of not having to deal with cords now and having stereo sound first before I can make an honest review. But so far, calls worked great (people on the other end said I sounded clear), battery is rated for at least a whole day worth of use and the music sounds great (I am not super picky about the sound BUT am picky when it comes to static sounds and the like, which I did not hear)Only time will tell how well this will hold up. I will update this review with any bad (or good) observations in the future that are worth mentioning. For now, 4 stars for the initial impression.---- UPDATE ---- ONE YEAR LATER ----So I have had these headphones for a year now and still work like day one. I am leaving at 4 stars because while it serves its purpose well, I wish it had some type of battery meter. It pairs well with my iPhone 5 (upgraded since the last time) and the buttons on the BT headset still function properly. Battery life seems to be good. I wear the headset in the office, while working out and cleaning. None of the components have started to wear off and no clips or ear buds have broken off. I use for music and taking calls over bluetooth and it is good. By good I mean it serves its purpose. If you're looking for rich bass and treble with amazing voice call quality - you may want to look elsewhere (like in the $100 range). Mines lasted a year so its been worth the investment (cost me $50 at the time).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review45" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-21:</strong> While researching well-rated bluetooth stereo headsets, I narrowed it down to two choices: this LG 700W or the Air Fi Runaway that was also rated well by customers. I decided on this LG item first since it seems more inconspicuous and won't leave a dent in the hair, LOL! The Runaway headset does seem sturdier though..Upon first seeing this LG item, I was surprised how skinny and flexible the loop part of this headset was (the section that goes around the back of the neck)! Indeed very lightweight and I hope this doesn't make it too fragile. Want this headset to last awhile ..To start, swing the usb slot cover out to charge the unit via a micro usb to wall outlet plug. It paired easily with a Samsung Galaxy 7&#34; Tab 2 and also to an older model flip cellphone. The headset vibrates and flashes when there's an incoming call. Pressing the button on one end turns off the music and connects the headset to the incoming call. Talk quality is excellent from both sides of the phone conversation.The magnetic earbuds are seated into the grooved ends of the headset and the wire slide adjustments take up the slack to keep the cords from getting all tangled up. I would recommend storing the headset in a protective pouch or ziploc bag to prevent the wires and all the various buttons from getting scraped up and damaged.This is an impressive product .. recommended!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review46" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-02:</strong> I'm the type of guy who hates to be tied down with cords.

Although the collar does seem a bit Star Trek it really is no inconvenience given the added controls, extended battery life and ergonomic fit. After trying dozens of horrible Bluetooth devices throughout the years I can ASSURE YOU that you need look no further. I've only had it 2 days now but I'm THOROUGHLY IMPRESSED!!! I'll update a month or 2 from now and see if my feelings are the same about it.p.s. the only potential issue I've noticed (and this could be a coincidence) but there is suddenly a massive echo error on my iPad 3 since syncing to this device... I don't know... might be nothing, time will tell.----UPDATE:I've had these headsets now over 6 months and in fact have bought 2 pair (had to replace the 1st set due to a puppy chewing incident). Unfortunately I've had to lower my rating to 3 stars from 5 becasue of one major issue that exist in both of my headsets.1. EVERYTIME I'm on these headsets EVERY PERSON I speak to says the background noise is too loud. So other than chatting on the phone in my car or living room in absolute silence I really can't use these for phone conversations. Apparently the gym sounds like a circus on these sets and jogging sounds like I'm running through desert storm in the middle of a gun fight. Its really a shame because other than that (and the inconvenience of them falling off my neck when lying down - e.g. bench press, sit ups, etc.) these sets would be perfect. Unfortunately I have gone back to wired sets for phone conversations. *sigh!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review53" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-14:</strong> Was looking for a set of STEREO headphones that I could listen to my music off my Droid 4 phone, while still being able to take calls through the Bluetooth aspect. I was leery, and read others' reviews. Have owned them for about 3-4 months and thinking about buying an extra pair now, just in case they don't make these any more, when my first pair wear out.I use them more for music than phone calls, but they do a good job of both.  Noooo, they aren't high-end headphones, but  I was pleasantly surprised at how good they sound.  And I did like another customer suggested (in one of the other reviews on Amazon), and ordered some inexpensive ear bud covers to replace the stock ones they come with, and it helped even more. Combined with buying the affordable ($5 ?) Power Amp music amplifier app (Android), I have GREAT SOUND now.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review54" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-10:</strong> I purchased this and it was everything that I expected.

Call quality on my end is fine but anything but the most quiet environment and the other person will be complaining. The girlfriend was saying the music playing at Sub Way was louder than me, same goes for a tv playing in the background which didn't even sound that loud to me.

These are great. The design is much more comfortable that I expected. As many reviews state, you really do forget you are wearing them.Not having to worry about the cord snagging and wrapping around every little thing takes a little getting used to.The sound is much better than an old wrap around BT that did pretty much the same things as the LG, just poorly.I didn't think that there was such a device that would provide great battery life, good range, great sound, and practical design in one package.The LG Tone has done so admirably.The meh: Running, and outdoors generally, are slightly better. Earphones do allow me to hear outside noise. The buds tend to slip around with jarring and moisture. Other than super glue, there really isn't a good solution though. Wind can be a problem, but what system doesn't have that problem.The cord can get hung up on the collar, or a shoulder strap catch it, but this has only happened two or three times. This is easy to avoid.Summary: The phone is great. The mike picks up just what it needs to. The controls are perfectly placed and I really love the magnetic earbud holders.All in all my expectations were guarded at first, but I've been completely satisfied with all aspects of this device.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review57" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-06:</strong> (though as a qualifier there are few out there that I have been satisfied with)Pros-Lightweight, Switch for power(opposed to holding a button) good sound quality, comfortable earbuds, good battery life, vibration functionCons-Magnets do not hold earbuds in place for storage, flashing LED light on front, pieces that hold the cable back are poorly designed, lacking in volume(common in most bluetooth headsets)Sound quality is the most important factor and the LG 700s are above par in the field of bluetooth headset, a good balance of highs and lows and good fit that are all hard to find in a set of wired earbuds in this price range much less in a bluetooth headset. Next is comfort and they again succeed where others have failed, the main unit is very lightweight and when I'm in my work attire with a collared shirt I wear it underneath the collar and on top of my undershirt and would not even notice that it is there. In a T-Shirt it's a bit different but still not uncomfortable. The only problem I have had is while out running the ends of the unit will bounce up and down on the top of my chest which gets very annoying, I usually end up shoving the whole thing behind my back and just using the earbuds to hold in up. The vibrating notification for calls is a novel concept that I love though it kind of freaked me out at first since I was not aware that it did that.My big complaints are with the design of the cable and the earbud holders, the magnet are far too weak and they often get knocked out. Sometimes I just let them hang down the inside of my shirt instead of bothering with them. Then the way the cable is designed to attach to the back band seems poorly designed where the clips get pushed too far forward or back holding the cable up.In the end I would recommend it as the best out there right now, there is the 730 model but there seem to be some large kinks to work out.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review58" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-14:</strong> I bought this on a whim based on the massive number of stellar reviews.  Despite that, it's better than I expected. The sound is outstanding, much better than my Motorola S9.  It is remarkably comfortable.  The headset itself weighs next to nothing and on top of that, it's resting on your shoulders.  The controls are well sized and easy to operate.  In particular, with a sliding on/off switch you can tell at a glance which it is and also turn it off without looking and also reliably turn it on or off while you're wearing it.The design is... perfect.  I like that while I'm wearing the headset and someone comes up to me all I need do is flip one of the ear-buds out and I can hear what they're saying.  If it's someone I *really* care about I flip both out.  If it's someone I don't want to talk to I flip... never mind.  When I want to resume resuming the ear buds are easy to retrieve.  If I want to get fancy I can drop them in the magnetic holders at either end of the around-my-neck thingy.The headset works flawlessly with my iPhone4.  The "call" button answers calls if someone is calling, hangs up when I'm done, and get's Siri's attention at other times.  Thanks to a decent microphone Siri understands what I say as do people I call.  Also, unlike the S9, it doesn't matter where I carry my phone.  The signal is clear at all times.About the only time I used my S9 was while I walked my dog.  I'm using these lots more.  While they don't sound as good as some of my wired headsets (costing many times more) they do sound pretty darn good and there is the convenience of not having to deal with a cord.In some ways this headset travels better than wired headsets because there's nothing to get tangled.  Just drop the earbuds in their individual magnetic holders and put the whole thing in a flat compartment of your backpack, briefcase, purse, satchel, valise, etc, and you're good to go.  For me it fits nicely in pocket #3 of myMoblie Edge, Mini Messenger Bag fits up to 13.3- Inch laptops and 11- Inch widescreen netbooks, Black/Dr Pepper.So how, you ask, can you make it better still?  This headset came with two different sized pairs of ear gels, one pair slightly larger than medium and the other pair slightly smaller than medium.  My problem is, these press-to-fit ear gels never work for me.  Some work better than others and these worked about as good as any but it wasn't perfect; they would slip out on occasion.  Then I stumbled across these:2 Pair, Mens Size - Earphones Plus Brand, Tri-Level, Replacement Ear Cushions, Earbuds for Sound Isolating Earphones. (See Fit Information in Details Below).  They fit both this headset and my ears perfectly.  The soft silicon (?) seals out noise, keeps the ear buds from slipping out without having to drive them in with a hammer, and they make the headset sound even better.  *Now* it's totally perfect!Please feel free to let Amazon and me know if this review was helpful to you since it helps me improve the information I provide.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review59" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-30:</strong> I've owned a few variations of Bluetooth headsets that I've used while exercising, including the Motorola S-9 and S-10 and the Jaybird Freedoms. The new LG Tone 700 may look a bit strange, but it quickly became my favorite Bluetooth headset for exercise and general use.The 700 fits around your neck, and is light enough that you really don't know you're wearing them. The only caveat I'd add regarding comfort is that if you're wearing a collarless shirt, like a tee shirt when running, you will feel the headset's thin band on the back of your neck. This doesn't bother me since the Jaybirds have a wire connecting the two earbuds that also rides the back of our neck, and the Motorola headsets have a heavy, think band that goes back and over your ears. When evaluating comfort, also keep in mind that a regular wired headset or earbuds have a wire that's flapping around. On balance, the LG headset is really the most comfortable and least noticeable of those I've tried.Surprisingly, the LG's stay in place, even when running. Unlike the Jaybirds, which have some weight to them that helps to dislodge them from your ear, the LG earbuds are featherweight and stay put. After the first few minutes of wearing them, I didn't even notice that I had them on, they're really that comfortable. With a collared shirt, like a polo, I didn't feel the headband at all. It's like they're not there!The LG's have the best battery life by far of any of the Bluetooth headsets I've owned. I tried an experiment with the LG's where I used them on two 1-hour runs, then took them to the golf course where I volunteer once a week and listened to them for 6 hours straight. The battery didn't quit and still had enough juice to keep running. The Jaybirds and the Motorolas would both have died after about 3 to 4 hours of use.The built-in phone works great, and no one I talked to with the LG's complained about the sound, even though I was outdoors. I often got complaints with the Jaybirds that people had trouble hearing me.I will concede that the Jaybirds have better sound and noticeably better fidelity than the LG's. The LG can be adjusted to boost the bass response, but they don't match the Jaybirds for sound. On the other hand, the Jaybirds can't compete with the battery life of the LG, so you'll have to decide what's most important to you. I mostly listen to audiobooks while I exercise so a small loss of fidelity, while disappointing, isn't a deal breaker for me.There is a newer version of this headset, the 730, but after reading the reviews, I thought I'd stick with the 700. There are reports that the 730 is less stable holding onto a Bluetooth signal, although I can't verify those reports. I can say that the 700 is rock solid and doesn't drop the audio stream even when the phone is in my pocket of backpack.The bottom line is that I think the LG's are a great value for the price. The Motorola S-9's LED burned out on me after a year, and the S10 wasn't nearly as comfortable as its sibling. The Jaybird Freedom slips out of my ear, even with all of their adapters, so I'm constantly fiddling with them as I run. In addition, the Jaybird Freedoms have limited controls for your iPhone or iPod. Stop, start and volume are about all you can do, as well as answer a call. With the LG you can fast forward or reverse as well as jump tracks. Another plus in this area for the LG is that it can tell you it's remaining battery life via its LED, which the Jaybirds can't.Compared to these products, the LG Bluetooth Stereo Headset is my new benchmark for audio. They do look a bit weird, but they really are well designed to deliver maximum battery life, a strong Bluetooth connection, and all the controls you need to manipulate your iPhone or Android device.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review60" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-17:</strong> good product no issues so far, i really like how its secure during physical activity and rapid movements.

I use these to listen to Pandora all day at work and still have a bit of battery to use them while playing WoW on the laptop.  No connection issues, and it works fairly well to pair with multiple items.  Call clarity is decent.  The bass response is ok when you turn the boost on.I have one small complaint:  If the wires were just 2-5 mm longer that would be great.  I dont think I have a big head, but when the unit is under my collar, where honestly they market the device to "hide", I have a hard time turning my head without getting some resistance of a taught cord from one of the ears.  Maybe thats just me.**Update**Wanted to provide a 6 month account of the product.  Still works great.  Battery seems to be just as good out of the box.  I use this 10+ hours out of the day making calls and listening to streaming music. It lasts longer than my PoS Samsung SIII with its crappy battery life.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review73" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-16:</strong> yes i was a bit nerves to buy it, but i love it so much. i wouldnt go a day without it. and the sound is just great</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review74" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-11:</strong> I'm very satisfied with that product. It was very easy to pair up with iPhone 3gs and iPhone 4. It is also easy to use it. You can listen to the music, and when you receive a phone call you have a calling tone and vibration alert. Simple answering with one button. Good quality of the sound. Also very good range as it comes to the distance from the phone to the headset. You can leave your phone in one room and talk / listen to the musing being in another room. Flexible neck part and in general good quality of the product.UPDATE:One day when I was putting my headset on one of the ear plugs fell off. I contacted the customer service, sent the product to them and they sent it back untouched saying it is mechanical damage. I know it wasn't, and I know that the company didn't put any effort to resolve the issue. Even if they thought it was my fault and didn't want to replace the product it shouldn't be a huge deal to put some glue on it. I read some other reviews of this product and it seems like I'm not the first one whose ear piece fell off.. Week connection in the plastic parts parts is not a huge deal, but I'm very disappointed with how the customer service avoids responsibility for a faulty item.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review75" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-05:</strong> How I use it:I wear this while biking to work. I keep my smartphone (which the headset is connected to via Bluetooth) in a pouch beneath my bike seat. I only use the left earbud (illegal to wear 2 earbuds while riding a bike in California, and its safer to only wear one).Bluetooth connectivity:Works very well. It automatically connects to my smartphone when I turn the headset on. The connection rarely cuts out and, if it does, cuts out for less than a second.Audio:The sound quality seems pretty good.Locking the earbuds into the earbud holder:The earbuds have magnets in them (don't worry, they shouldn't fry your brain...) so they 'lock in' to the earbud holders pretty easily, and then they stay there (even when I'm bouncing around on my bike). The magnets are nice because they enable me to lock the earbuds into the earbud holders without looking, and also when I have semi-bulky gloves on. Occasionally, the earbuds do fall out of the earbud holders; this usually happens when I am riding 'hard' and am bumping up and down a lot while riding.Comfort:I often forget that I'm wearing this headset. That is how comfortable and light and unobtrusive this headset is! The earbuds, themselves, are very comfortable, as well. The neckband is especially useful for me because I only wear one earbud. If there was no neckband that holds earbuds not in use, the earbud that I do not use would hang and pull the other earbud down.Button Controls:The volume and song skip buttons are very accessible. I can even press them when I have semi-bulky gloves on, though I can often press the wrong button (volume up instead of volume down).Battery Life:The headset lasts something like 500 - 800 minutes on a full charge. This is really good.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review76" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-11-17:</strong> Sound quality is excellent on both sides of the conservation.Battery life is longIt is comfortable to wear and light weightBlue tooth link works perfectly with my I-phone, never drops and I can around my flat with it.Music qulity is better than my wired ear buds.I use this everyday: work, gym, home and car.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review77" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-03:</strong> I bought these headphones for running in the gym.

First my evaluation; then the comparison.Setup: EasyI charged the LG and turned it on.  I turned on bluetooth on my Samsung Note, and then hit the button to search for bluetooth devices.  The Note immediately found the LG and I told it to pair - which took less than 5 seconds.Comfort: Good.The LG sits around my neck almost unnoticed. It comes with only 2 silicone ear bud sizes, but the larger one fit my ears.  The ear buds are then just as comfortable as any other ear bud.Snagging wires: No wires!Other ear buds must be connected by their wires to the phone/device and are prone to snagging.Range: About 30 feet.Casual Listening: Great!No hum, no hiss, no obvious distortion, and overall volume is good.  I usually have my Samsung Note music player set to 9/15 loudness with the LG volume set 3 down from the max loudness. The  LG Tone is a pleasure to use.COMPARISONContestants:1. LG Tone HBS-700 Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset (set to bass boost)2. Samsung Note Ear Buds3. JBuds Hi-Fi Noise-Reducing Ear Buds4. GOgroove DynaMIX High-Performance Ear Buds5. Sennheiser HD203 Closed-Back DJ Headphones (full size)6. JVC HA-RX500 Over-the-Ear Headphones (full size)Last Place: Gogroove.  Maybe this is unfair.  GOgroove didn't sound bad and seemingly (see below) had good base, but it was way too bright for my taste.  [If your ears have lost sensitivity to high frequencies maybe this would be your first choice.]Second Place: LG Tone, Samsung, and Jbuds.Really, it was hard to tell the difference between any of these 3 second place ear buds.  They were all a bit bright and all seemingly (see below) had good thumping base.  All 3 have what I would call a good quality of sound (low distortion).  I am happy that the LG sounded as good (to my ears) as any of the other ear buds.First Place: Sennheiser and JVC full size headphones.I hope nobody is surprised here!  There is just no way an ear bud can beat a good quality over-ear full-size headphone.  The ear buds only began to seem a bit bright when compared to the full size headphones.  Clarity was also better in the full size headphones (but not much better).  BASS RESPONSE?  This was the big difference.  After all, the JVC has a 40mm driver (almost 2 inches in size)!  Although the ear buds seemed to have good bass response, as soon as I put on the full size headphones the sad truth became obvious.  ALL of the ear buds were weak on bass and none of them had any very deep bass what-so-ever.  But then you knew that already, didn't you?Conclusion:  I think that all the second place ear buds (including the LG Tone) are at least adequate for casual listening, and because of their smaller size they are more convenient to carry around.  The  LG Tone was my favorite since it didn't have wires to snag.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review94" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-24:</strong> So before I bought this product I kept shocking myself with my plug in earphones....I kept forgetting I was connected to my phone and want to move about my work area only to be pulled back or for my phone to be pulled off my desk.

Bear in mind all 3 were different brands and all 3 had significant faults to them that forced me to return them.For starters I was kind of put off by it being called &#34;wireless&#34; when infact you have wires leading to the actual ear pieces but that's just semantics I guess. They seemed durable, flexible and looked like they could be around for the long haul. I had no problem syncing them with my Android phone and the sound clearly beats out the Plantronics rival and the Motorola. While the bass is weak the overall sound quality is the best one could expect from a Bluetooth device. Same goes for the call quality.Now looking at the device before I purchased it one would assume that since it sits around your neck it would be stiff like a partial necklace in case you had to have them on while you were doing anything that required you to be horizontal. Not the case, it is flimsy and really the only thing keeping this on your neck is the weight (not much of it) of the ends/buttons. This poses a significant problem if your sole reason for purchasing these is to utilize them at the gym. If you need to do a bench workout, situps or anything that requires you to lay flat even for a moment these will fall right off your neck. When running with these they bounce around your neck and don't feel at all secure. I tucked mine into my shirt but I'd imagine if your a woman and run in a sports bra or tank top that's just not going to be possible.Much like the Motorola I wanted to like these but at the end of the day the cons really outweighed the pros and I could not in good conscience let LG keep my money for this product. I'm hoping one day someone get's this mastered for a reasonable price but until then if you're an active guy/gal and looking specifically for a gym headset I'd stick with a good pair of wired ear buds.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review101" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-04:</strong> I got these as an alternative to the Plantronics backbeats I had been using. On the backbeats, the bulk of the units rests behind your ears, and on these, only the buds come up to your ears. In theory they Tone would be more comfortable. They are but the Tone is lopsided wieghtwise so one side tends to slip down, which shortens the wire on that side and makes the bud pull out of you ear if you turn your head.They look better than the backbeats, but the backbeats have better bass. also the buds are very easy to knock out of thier rests.On the plus side, you can have the buds out of your ears, and the unit will vibrate when a call comes in so you can quickly pop a bud in and answer</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review102" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-16:</strong> Nice product if you don't workout.

Bluetooth headphones are a challenge for hardware designers because of the need to house the electronics and a big enough battery to supply decent autonomy, and the need for a wire between the electronics and both earpieces.This is why so far there has only been two major designs on the market: one is large over-the-ear pads connected with a headband or just a wire, the other being earbuds connected by a wire to a little box housing the electronics. Both designs have problems: the former is usually uncomfortable and the earpads tend to have problems staying in place, particularly when exercising; the latter defeats the purpose of wireless headphones by still leaving you to deal with a tangled mess of wires.The HBS-700 offers a novel approach to solving this problem: the electronics and controls are housed in a circle clip that sits around your neck, and the earbuds are connected to it by a short wire that can't get tangled. Even better, the earbuds attach magnetically to the tips of the neckband when not in use.Ergonomically, the HBS-700 gets top marks. The usual controls are very logically organized and easy to identify by touch even while running or exercising. The power switch is a mechanical slider, so there's never any doubt whether your headphone is on or off. Charging is done via a standard microUSB connector.The features are what you expect from bluetooth stereo headphones: bluetooth action button (pick up an incoming call, hang up, initiate a call/siri, redial), volume +/- on the left hand side, play/pause, previous and next on the right hand side. Everything works very reliably and just as you would expect (I have been using these headphones for months with an iPhone 4)Even better, the battery life is phenomenal (at least 10 hours of music playback) and the neckband vibrates when a call comes in: impossible to miss a call even in a noisy environment or while exercising.If you're listening to music and a call comes in, press the call button to pick up the call and the music pauses. When you hang up, the music resumes.In terms of sound quality, the HBS-700 delivers as well. These are not high quality audiophile headphones, but they sound perfectly adequate and will be great to use at the gym, while jogging, etc...Convenience, sound quality, battery life, reasonable price make the HBS-700 an excellent value. If you're only going to buy one set of bluetooth headphones, I can't think of a better model to recommend -- and I've tried them all.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review112" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-28:</strong> I use this at work and working out, the distance is incredible and the sound is amazing. it hides under the collar for a stealthy look.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review113" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-28:</strong> I have bought 3 versions of stereo bluetooth headsets.

The headset works very well.  The auto override of the music to the phone and back has been flawless.  The bluetooth has been the best functioning bluetooth units I have ever had.So far, the only nits I have are the charging cover seems strange, the UP/DOWN (Next/PREVIOUS) song selector is the opposite direction as the volume UP/DOWN, and mostly, the charger light.

We've had them about 3 months and generally I can get a fully work day about 9-10 hours plus a one hour workout.  I have a pair of Artic headphone which have phenominal battery life but are silly to wear cause they stick out far.ComfortWe always forget we are wearing them. Last week, my wife jumped into the shower with them on but I saw her jump in and was able to stop her before they received a thorough shampoo treatment.  They go best on the inside of some shirts and under the collar of others.The LookPeople are always asking about where they can get these.  If you are one of these people, you are getting much warmer...IOS/ipad and Blackberry and AndroidThese can be paired with two devices at once but there's a trick to it.  Connect the phone first.  If it connects to my ipad before the Blackberry it won't connect to Blackberry at all until bluetooth is off on IOS.  When it works, it works greatand music pauses while I take my call and resumes afterward.I've tried several different ear buds with these but ended up (unknowingly) back with the original size.  Other buds I had came from and earbud tip kit i bought at an airport electronics place.  Not that it matters, but I saw reviews trashing the headset because the person using them couldn't get a replacement.

It synked up to my Palm Pixie phone with out a hitch!! The sound is AWESOME!! One suggestion to those who might want to buy this headset, as with any bluetooth headset. If your phone is in a craddle, make sure you do not walk away from your phone for more than 30 feet. The headset will go into standby mode. You must reconnect to your phone when you get back within the 30 foot range. Also, girls if you have long hair or a necklace on, make sure you remove your necklace and put your hair up. Keeps everything from getting tangled in the headset. Speaking from experience...

I've had a couple of Jawbone models and many pairs of corded headphones/ear-buds by Apple, Phillips, and Sony.  Problems with all of these include difficulties keeping the cord out of my way while working, volume levels too weak for loud noise environments, problems with the buds staying in my ears, and poor battery life.  This model corrects all of these deficiencies.The ear buds stay in my ears well because they are very light and the rubber tips seal well.  This was my biggest problem with the Jawbone models-even the icon was heavy enough to jostle out of my ears simply by walking.  All of the battery weight in this model is around your neck (and it's not that they're heavy, because they're not - it's just that even a little heft won't stay in my ear)  This setup also allows LG to cram at least 3 times as much battery into the halo around your neck, because the battery life is three times as long as the Jawbone, and as far as I could tell in my research, it has a better battery life than any other Bluetooth headset.Even running, the halo never threatens to fall off my neck, and I often forget it's there.  (Update; this is not the case when the buds are in the magnet pockets.  What happens then is that the buds bounce out of the pockets.  Bottom line, don't run without the buds in your ears.)The volume levels are fantastic, and with my Iphone 4 it gets louder than I can handle (and I am a drummer, I can handle loud). I can barely say this about many of the corded headsets that I have used.The range of this headset with my Iphone is the best I have ever experienced.  Maintaining line of sight, I can easily exceed 100 meters without losing signal.  In my warehouse, with many obstructions, I can exceed 50 meters as long as I don't enter a closed room without my phone.I cannot testify as to its water resistance.Callers tell me that background noise levels are much quieter than with my other headsets, which was an issue I didn't find addressed often in other reviews.There are many buttons on the headset, and initially I kept confusing the phone side with the media side (left is phone, right is media).  However, they are easy to use, have a nice feel when I press them, and I get the impression by the way that they feel when I press them that they will prove to be durable, which is a good thing because in my experience it's often buttons that wear out first on devices of this kind.The wires that connect the halo to the buds are not heavy duty, and are thin enough to have caused me a little anxiety at first, but it has not been a problem, and I cannot give too much praise to the designer who came up with the idea to provide magnetic pockets to hold the buds.  This is ingenious, and not only keeps them from flopping around when they're not in my ears, but also minimizes the opportunities for damaging them.Overall, this headset has a excellent design and is well built.  I love it, and when I wear this one out I will buy another.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review119" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-10:</strong> There was a great review of these on CNet - that is what prompted me to get them.

If you listen to music where bass is an important component, this is probably not the headset for you.  For bass, I give this headset a 2 out of 5.However, for mobility and convenience, this headset easily gets a 5 out of 5.  You quickly will forget that you have them on.  The controls on the device allow forward, back, pause, play, up volume, down volume, call answering, etc.  Also, if you're accustomed to the low volume of many bluetooth devices, the LG HBS-700 will blow you away because the volume is adjustable to uncomfortably loud levels, so you will never have trouble hearing a caller on the other end.Great device overall and I'm pleased with my purchase.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review121" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-17:</strong> I like that volume, Voice Control, track forward/backward, and play/pause can be controlled without much fuss.That said, the buttons could benefit from being stiffer to prevent actuation while touch-finding which button one desires.The sound is a bit muddy: fine for audiobooks and voice calls, but not for music.The blinking "On" light can be slightly annoying or distracting, and can draw attention.Lastly, these are HORRIBLE when running - they bounce sharply onto the clavicle with each stride.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review122" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-18:</strong> My wife likes to listen to the audio books, so I was looking for a type of the Bluetooth stereo headset that would be great for both, listening to audio and talk on a phone.  This particular piece has a very nice design.  However, it is very thick and kind of too big to hang on someone's neck while talking on a phone or listening to a music.  Sound quality is good (notice not great) because if there is a noise in the background, person on another end of the call can barely hear you.  It's best for you to talk on a phone via this Bluetooth headset when you're located in the quiet area.  Plus you can't go too far from the phone with this headset.  I'd return it, but unfortunately it's already too late for that.

I'm ordering another!This is one of the few (perhaps the only) bluetooth headsets that features a dedicated fast-forward button (quick press for next track, hold longer for fast-forward within a track).The FF offers a quick beep every other second it is pressed (which is good; it lets you know it's registered the button press and is obeying your command).I'm using an iPhone 4S. Connecting the unit via bluetooth has been easy.The sound is fine for podcasts & audiobooks. For music, I found the LG Tone adequate -- but subtly lifeless, and it was necessary to dig into the iPhone's EQ settings to make music listenable (but still a bit lifeless).Since I'm using it during my 25-minute walking commute along noisy brooklyn streets (buses, trucks, sirens), I don't mind the merely adequate music playback (which most BT headsets suffer from).I mainly listen to audiobooks & podcasts anyway. And for anyone who's ever suffered through one of Leo Laporte's five-minute Ford Sync ads knows, that FF button will come in REALLY HANDY. (I don't own a car!) The main reason I bought this unit is so I can FF thru junk without fishing out my iPhone.Battery life seems normal for a stereo BT device, and the neck-wrap style is only annoying for a minute before it blends in with the weight of your winter coat.I'm pleasantly satisfied with my LG Tone. :)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review130" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-09:</strong> I have intermittent connection problem with my macbook as well as on my phone (samsung Infuse).Sound quality is mediocre at best sounding like hollow air.Surprisingly, it's quite comfortable around your neck,  You will have to get used to which button is which (ie sound +/- vs next/previous, and phone/play button).  in the beginning I had to take it to know look at the button, but I now know button's location.Max distance is about ~12ft, before it starts becoming staticky.I would have given 4 stars if it better sound and connectivity, but for now it deserves 2 star.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review131" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-17:</strong> I have had several mono and stereo Bluetooth headsets.

Every aspect of it was paid excellent attention to. The headphone sits very well across the neck and very seamlessly. I did not sense it while running after the first few minutes.Every operation (at least the ones we care for from a headphone) has a dedicated button. This means, you can concentrate on what you do instead of figuring out a button push sequence or using it in combination.The headsets are not think and heavy going into the ear and when you are done they snap back in place that fundamentally removes cluttered wires.Performance:The pairing was seamless. It only took a few seconds (MotoACTV).I am not a audio expert by any means, so take it from that perspective. The audio stream has been very stable without any "silence". The bass (especially when you run outside) is okay and the it also sound slightly tinny (which can probably be adjusted if we had an EQ app but the ACTV does not support such apps). It does not isolate external audio as well as it advertises. It is definitely not annoying (not even close) but i am not sure that the noise-suppression works as well as it is advertised.The battery was high when I received it and have run for about 2 hours now and haven't had a chance to recharge it yet.I haven't tried multi-connection with my phone yet. I will, someday, but dont have a usecase for it yet.Overall, if you are looking for a simple-to-use headset that you aren't constantly worried if it may fall down, get this one and you will not be disappointed. Do note that its not a performance headset but definitely well-designed and does well what it mainly sets off to do at its price-point.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review133" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-20:</strong> very good product.Very comfortable.Supplied rubber ear inserts are cheap, I used silicone ear inserts from a Nokia device instead.Battery lasts a respectable amount of time, but not the claimed amount of ten hours of use.Audio quality for listening to music is good (considering it is bluetooth).Microphone is good, no need to hold mic next to mouth or cheek.

Highly recommend this product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review137" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-20:</strong> Feb 20, 2013:Seriously... after I put this on, so many times I forgot that it was on my neck...It's just THAT light-weight and feels natural.My main purpose for this purchase was for jogging/exercise and I have yet to do so...Once I've done so for a good few weeks, I'll try to remind myself to update this review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review138" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-25:</strong> Got these headphones so I didn't have to deal with cables again.

It is comfortable and easy to use. The sound is great and the battery life is fantastic. If you like bass then you might be disappointed but the bass it has is enough. Its a bluetooth headset not meant to solely delivery ear shattering bass but provide easy hands free calling with the addition of stereo music listening.

I recently misplaced them, however, and will be upgrading to the new model (HBS-730).First, if you have never had wireless headphones, get ready for a treat.  Not having to worry about snagging a cord on something is great.  The battery lasts all day for me, and the duration did not seem to noticeably decrease after a year.I used them to listen to music and podcasts at work almost every day.  I appreciated the fact you can leave one earbud in, while the other sits safely in its magnetic holder.  This way I could still hear my coworkers.  Being able to leave my phone charging and still walk around while listening is great.  I can grab a glass of water from the water cooler or walk over to a colleague's desk without any hassle.  I am using a wired set of earbuds until my HBS 730 arrives, and it is amazing how much of an inconvenience the cord is.I enjoyed using them while running, although I know many hear have said the neckband bounced around too much for their liking.  This didn't bother me much so maybe my neck is bigger.  The fact that you don' t have a wire pulling on them as you run means they stayed in my ears better than a corded set.  Putting my phone in an armband and having no cord involved made running very enjoyable.Sound quality is OK.  It was better than I expected for a wireless set, and although I hear the newer version has improved sound quality, I had no complaints.  A lot of my listening was just talk radio podcasts with only one earbud in, but sound was decent for hip hop and rock when I was listening to music.Finally, just a comment on the build quality and durability.  As others have noted, these things seems to be very well built.  My set still looked new after a years worth of use.  I didn't exactly baby my set either.  They may seem kind of flimsy when you first pick them up, but the materials being used are apparently high quality.If I end up having range issues with the HBS-730 as some of the other reviewers have mentioned, I will likely end up returning those and coming back to the HBS-700.  The only thing that is NOT in question is that I apparently can't live without these, as replacing my lost pair was never in doubt.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review144" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-05:</strong> Not as comfortable as was thought and connectivity not as great.

However, even though it looked like it was in original packaging, it did NOT come with a user manual.  I had hoped it would also have multiple sizes of earbud covers, but no... And these earbuds are a bit too large for my ears.But I'm not returning this because I love the headset.  I use it with my iPhone 4 to listen to audio books.  Like it does with wired ear buds, it switches flawlessly between phone calls and my audio books.  Love the vibrations.  The only gotchas that I've encountered are:- I can't just hold down the phone button and go into voice control.  If I press the phone button, it only redials my previous call.  Hmmmm.  This will be s major problem when I can't look at the phone.  I did find the user manual online and downloaded it to my iPad, so will look to see if this is simply done differently on this headset.- earbud size a bit too large..  But they do seem to be secure, so I'll wear them for a few days to see how the comfort is after 4-6 hours.** correction after reading the user manual... voice control DOES work.  But where my old wired earbuds required me to press and hold the phone button to go into voice conntrol, this LG headset goes into 'redial' mode after 'press and hold'. Instead, just tap the phone button and voila, voice control.  It works great.So I've put this up to a 5star rating.  Am looking forward to finding out how long the headset lasts (wires DO break after heavy usage).  But no matter how long, I'm buying another one for my husband. This is exactly what I've been looking for!!** update 2:  tested this while wring the neck piece under the collar of my polo shirt.  Vibrations from an incoming call tickled (love that feature) and I got good reports on my voice quality despite that the microphone was under my collar.Am updating this after using it for months:  I absolutely love the vibrations on my neck letting me know there's an incoming phone call.  I many cases (especially in noisy areas), that is the only indicator I have.  Even though I have my phone set to ring and vibrate, it's this headset vibration that I notice.  Love it!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review148" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-17:</strong> These are some wonderful headphones. They can be a little trying when you're doing bench presses because they'll fall off your neck, but otherwise, I have no problem with them. In fact, I chose these over the newer model because of battery life. I keep them in my car and only use them 3-5 times a week for an hour or so. I've only recharged them because of the warning tone once.

This is the way to go!If you do a little research you will find that every single over the ear bluetooth set falls victim to sweat and moisture making its way into the circuitry and shorting it out... regardless of the 'Sweatproof' adverts. The only solution thus far seems to be moving the hardware to your neckline away from those hotspots. I have officially hit 4 months of constant use running and hitting the gym 3-5 times a week without a hitch. The convenience is unparalleled as you can run with your phone on your arm or workout with the phone on the ground next to you. I have taken calls in the middle of a set by simply hitting the call button. Change tracks on Pandora or even hold and speak to do voice commands. The possibilities are endless.Cons- The from factor makes for a bumpy ride if you are not wearing a shirt during a run. Normal use typically makes one end hang lower than the other which makes it feel awkward at first. Headphones can get wrapped around the set itself as the magnets are not very powerful.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review152" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-13:</strong> I've had these for just over a month now and they work as intended. They're light so you don't even know they're there and they're comfortable. Only fitment issue I've had are that the size/shape of the ear bud is just big enough that it doesn't quite fit properly in my ear canal. At first I thought it was the silicon bulbs but the problem still persisted even after I swapped the bulbs from my old ear buds which fit me perfectly and never came loose. I compared the size of these ear buds to my old pair and these were a touch bigger. If I'm just sitting down they stay seated in my ear canals fine, it's when I'm moving around that they come loose and the noise cancelling effect is diminished. Not a big deal but just a concern if you feel as though you have smaller ear canals.The buttons are a bit too easy to activate. It would be nice if they were a bit firmer or required a more deliberate push to activate the intended function. It's too easy to bump something or if I reach to adjust the headset on my neck I will accidentally tap a button when grabbing for the headset.The sound quality is so-so. This is my first pair of Bluetooth earbuds so I can only compare to my old wired earbuds which sound great, IMHO. I've never really heard much bass, and the sound overall is a bit hollow (if that makes sense?) and on the tinny side. Adequate but nothing special.I've used this headset with a Samsung Galaxy S and now with a Galaxy SIII, along with my wife's HTC Windows phone and it paired fine with all three. The only functionality issues I've had with both Galaxy phones is that I will hit the play/pause button to pause music and then if it sits paused long enough, when I hit the play button again it won't restart the music. When I look at the phone I see that each time I hit the play/pause button it's actually skipping to the next song but never actually plays it. I have to start the music on my phone again and then the play/pause button functions properly. I'm using PowerAmp on my Android phone as my music player so it may be an issue with PowerAmp as much as it may be an issue with the headset. I haven't tried it with any other media player on my phone to determine which is to blame. I only used them once for a brief time on my wife's Windows phone so I didn't thoroughly test out the full functionality on that phone.I've used these when walking/jogging, mowing the yard, riding my motorcycle, and just working around my house. They're always comfortable and I sometimes forget they're even there until I bend over or lean back or do something that causes the headset to slide up my neck or fall off my neck. I've had a few times where I've been wearing them while sweating profusely and so far, so good, they're doing okay.If I could make one improvement to the headset it would be to put some sort of rigid beam in the actual headset so that you can actually form the headset to stay in fitted position - picture a piece of wire hanger running through the headset - so you can manipulate the shape a bit and have it stay in that shape. This would be a huge benefit when I'm riding my motorcycle.Speaking of using them on my motorcycle. I searched the reviews as I purchased these specifically for use when riding my motorcycle and several reviews said they worked great on their motorcycle and didn't have any problems. I have to respectively, but vehemently, disagree with each and every one of them. I ride a sportbike and wear a full face (non-modular) helmet and a leather jacket with a bit of a collar. My first few rides I put on my jacket and put the headset on the outside of my jacket and the thing flew all over the place and smack up against my helmet, and if it wasn't blowing around, whenever I would turn my head to do a lane check, or look down to check my speed I routinely bumped a button causing an undesired result. I tucked the headset in my jacket and it still randomly tapped a button when I moved my head around or the headset just happened to shift in an unfortunate manner and would press up against the jacket collar. The only way I can wear these when riding my bike is to turn them backwards (opening is on the back of my neck) and flip'em upside down and then tuck the front into my collar and leave the sides (where the buttons are) exposed above my collar. It works but this is the main reason I would love to have some sort of semi-rigid spine in the headset that would allow me to bend and form the headset around my neck to keep it from flapping around. I'm still trying to think of some way to fit something to the headset to allow me to form it securely around my neck. I'm not knocking the headset for this, just sharing my experience that this may not work for you if you intend to wear them while on your motorcycle.I have yet to use them to a point that they've clearly run out of battery power. At most I've got them on for about 30-35 minutes at a time once or twice a day. I just tend to charge them about once every 7-9 days just to avoid them actually running out of juice when I really wanted to use them. For this reason I won't really comment on battery life.For the desire of the headset having some rigidness for mold-ability I knocked off a half-star - not that the headset doesn't function properly, just that this would be an improvement I think a lot of people would appreciate. The other 1-1/2 stars is for the too-easily-activated buttons and the okay sound quality. Firm up the buttons and improve the speakers and this is a solid 4-1/2 star product.**UPDATE** 9/3/2013:Just wanted to update this review after owning these for so long...Since last March I started jogging/running pretty much every day for 30-45 minutes outdoors along with going to the gym to lift weights several days a week. I've logged hundreds of miles on these earbuds and happy to say, despite all the sweat these things have seen, they're still working great. The charge still seems to last the same as well, I've only fully drained them a few times after multiple uses for varying amounts of time. One thing I've discovered is sometimes, depending on the pace of my jog, the headset tends to bounce around a bit and will hit against my collar bones. It isn't truly painful but definitely irritating after awhile. Additionally, when jogging, the same pace which causes them to bounce off my collar bones also causes the headset to shift around on my neck so I am constantly re-adjusting them to not be lopsided to one side or the other. These two traits only serve to reinforce my original suggestion of some form of rigidness to the spine of the headset. If you're a runner this may be of some concern for you; still nothing I would consider a deal-breaker, but felt it noteworthy nonetheless.Additionally, since my original review, I've also picked up an ASUS TF-700 tablet. The headset has an issue with connecting with the tablet; it works, but each time I pair the 2 I have to go into the Bluetooth settings and tap the headset entry to manually begin the pairing process as opposed to just turning on the Bluetooth antenna and the LG headset then waiting for the automatic pairing to take place. Additionally, and this is a ding against the tablet but related to the headset, ASUS, for some reason, decided to have Bluetooth and wi-fi share the same antenna. If you like to stream anything from the Internet - Netflix, YouTube, etc. - the audio will not be in sync; about a solid half-second delay in the characters' mouths moving and the dialogue being heard through the headset. If I intend to watch any streaming videos through my tablet I make sure to have a pair of wired earbuds with me. This is not an issue when watching videos stored on the tablet itself or an inserted memory card. Again, not a fault of the headset, just noting the issue.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review153" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-20:</strong> The around-the-neck design is good for all-day use and the earbuds fit my ears.

As good as any other wireless headset I've used and far better than my Sennheiser MM400s. The vibrating neckband is killer.I like having an analog on/off switch. This is missing on nearly everything these days.The form factor is great. I wear it everywhere under my shirt collar in a business casual environment. Hints of wires would be visible if you are wearing a more formal white business shirt, but my collared polo and sport shirts hide it well. The form factor is why you should buy this and why you will love it. As I stated before, I own the superior Sennheiser MM400 which has amazing audio quality. I rarely have the MM400 with me because it is not designed to wear as a business accessory. The form factor of these is perfect. Absolutely perfect. These will go with you everywhere. You will not look like a gadget spaz like the guys using the normal bluetooth accessories. When wearing the buds, you are wearing plain buds. They easily tuck away under your collar when not in use. The only bad thing about the aesthetics is the flashing blue light, but this is concealed by your collar.What I don't like:Unfortunately, the stereo sound quality is pretty poor. They don't sound as good as stock iPhone/iPod buds. They sound like cheap $10-$20 buds. Highs and lows are clipped. They funnel all sound into the muddy mids. Imagine a stock FM car stereo from 1984. I'd gladly pay $200 more for this form factor with the sound quality of my Sennheiser MM400s.Conclusion:Buy these. Buy them now. For &lt;$50, they are a great value and you will use them every day. I gave them 3 stars but they really almost merit four when you consider how flippin' cheap they are.For listening to music in a less-portable more-conspicuous form factor, buy yourself a pair of good quality Sennheisers (wired or bluetooth, they are the best for sound quality).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review155" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-02:</strong> I work at a cell phone provider (where we sell these for $70) and these are the staff favorite.

Almost all of the good stuff said about this Headset are absolutely true.Especially Good:* Lightweight* Keeps BT radiation further from your brain than most (i.e. BTR is not directly in your ear)* Great sound quality, I am sure there are superior analog buds, but they sound great to me.* I use these for exercise. I wrap the headphones under my necklace to keep the headset around my neck.* Magnetic earbud holders pretty much set a new standard.The Bad:* Serious connectivity issues when listening to streamed music on my phone. Does not work as well with wifi enabled, but this could just be my phone. Tested with Grooveshark and Pandora on a Nexus One.* When Jogging, I use a very small back pack to hold my phone and everything works as expected. When walking with the same backpack, more connectivity issues (wtf is that?!). Oh well, works perfectly fine in my pocket.* Constant blinking blue light when in use or listening to music. Can be annoying when in the dark.* Doesn't work well (for me) when connecting to a PC, either in Windows or Linux (poor sound quality). Did not test with a Mac.I do not in any way regret my purchase at all. Perfect dedicated headset for my phone which was the only reason why I purchased it. I wish streamed music would not cause connection issues, but I have no problem getting more MP3s for my phone so as to avoid these issues. Will test with a kindle fire soon and update this review to see if streamed music still causes issues.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review160" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-27:</strong> I purchased these for my wife because she likes to listen to audio books a lot.  She is constantly complaining about catching her earphone cables on things as she works around the home so I thought this would be a nice gift. The first thing she said is that they were comfortable to wear and she really didn't even know she had them on.The sound out of them is pretty good and the dynamic range is not bad at all.  She uses them on her iPhone and iPad 2 to listen to music and audio books.  Now she can lay her phone or iPad 2 down in the kitchen and walk about 35 feet away in any direction with very good reception.  This includes shooting the Bluetooth signal through 2 walls.  At 40 to 45 feet the sound starts breaking up and at 45 feet it just loses connection.  As you walk back into range it immediately reconnects to the source.The headphones can connect to two devices but only one of them can be a phone.  Set it up with your phone first and then use the manual linking method to set it up with a playing device only, like an iPad.The earphones come with a recharger pack and they charged very quickly.  You can listen to music or talk on the phone 10 hours before needing to recharge.The headset has multiple buttons for your use while wearing the device.  There is an on/off switch, volume up/down rocker switch, a call switch that is used for connecting and disconnecting from calls and pairing the headset to your device and a microphone all located on the LH side. The call button also has a blue LED ring around it that is a solid blue when the headset is searching for a pairing device and it flashes blue when it is in normal operating mode.  While charging, the headset is off and the blue ring turns to red.  When the charger is connected the headset turns off regardless of what position the on/off switch is in. There is also a charging port on the inner side of the LH part of the headset.  On the RH side there is a Rew/FF button, and a play/pause button.  The earplugs magnetically fit into the headset when not in use.The LED ring around the call button can also help you to determine the amount of charge left in the headset.  If you press and hold the call button for 3 seconds the LED ring will light up for 1 second.  Solid blue means high charge, violet means medium charge and red means low charge.While playing music you can skip forward or back one song or chapter by quickly pressing the REW/FF rocker switch.  If you hold the switch you can speed forward or back as long as you hold the switch down.  You can answer a call, transfer a call, voice dial, recall the last number dialed, end a call, go to call waiting or reject a call all by using the call button.  Remember your phone device must be able to handle these types of actions for them to work.Our unit came with two different sets of ear buds that looked like medium and large.  Make sure that you use the set that best fits into your ear for comfort and also for good noise blocking.  It will also help you to get the best sound as most of the audio output will be directed into your ear and give you the best sound.  If they are too loose then part of the sound is lost and you will not get the best sound fidelity.The unit also features a bass boost that can be turned on.  If you press the up and down volume rocker switch on both sides for 1 second it will switch between normal EQ or Bass Boost.  You will hear a beep in the headset when the change is made.Cons:Some items on the device seem fragile as the headset is really a high tech miniature piece of electronics.  The flap that covers the charging port for example just seems excessively fragile.There is the geek effect in that you have this ring around your neck and there is a flashing blue light going when you have it turned on.  You forget you are wearing it but people do look at you sort of strangely.One thing that I did not like is that when we received the unit we noticed that the internal box that contained the headset had been opened before we got it.  The special sealing tape from the factory had been cut and the wall charger plastic bag had been opened.  In addition there was an empty bag for another set of ear buds.  When we purchased the unit it was supposed to be new and the fact that it was opened indicated that it had either been returned or opened in the warehouse.  I don't care for that as I paid for new merchandise but the unit has performed well so far.  I didn't deduct any stars for the opened box as it does not reflect on the product but it certainly does on the seller!Overall we like the headset and I would recommend it to you!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review161" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-06:</strong> I've tried a bunch of bluetooth headsets and this one is the best one I've found so far. They are good for biking, rollerskating, erging (rowing on a stationary rower) and walking all over the place to do errands.Since the bulk of the headset rests around your neck, the earbuds are really light, which helps them stay in your ear. I did end up putting my own silicone tips on them because the ones that come with didn't fit me quite right, but I usually have this problem with most silicone earbud tips.When I first got these, I never really used them to talk to people, in fact I wasn't even pairing them with my phone. Then one time I did have them paired to my phone and I heard a noise and pressed a button and what's this? I'm having a conversation with someone on my phone! I was riding my bike in traffic at the time, had no idea what I was doing and yet was able to answer the phone, have a conversation and then hang up afterwards, so I'd say the controls are pretty intuitive. I've used some other headsets where buttons do a lot of different things, since there just aren't that many buttons, but these let you answer the call on your left, pause your music with the right, raising and lowering volume is on one side, going forward and back on tracks is on the other. I really find it easier to navigate than the styles that try to be smaller and more compact.They do move around sometimes. Especially when riding my bike, they will EVENTUALLY start twisting to the side so by the time I've finished a ride and removed my sling bag, sometimes they are completely out of place and maybe hanging off my back on one side. Meanwhile, of course the earbuds will have fallen out. When they do come out, though, there is never a yanking out from the ears as I've experienced with other headsets with earbuds. The earbuds also come out of their magnetic holders sometimes, but overall they stay put pretty well.I will often be wearing these when I get wherever I'm going walking or biking and I don't find people staring at them strangely or even seeming to notice them much, which I think it a plus.The sound is decent quality and there is some noise cancelling going on. I sometimes wear just one ear at a time, especially if I'm in traffic or I just want to hear what's going on around me. I do find that weird head movements (especially biking or maybe rooting around in my bag while on the train) can sometimes cause buttons to be pushed, like all of a sudden I guess I've pushed the pause button with my chin or turned the volume up/down when twisting around.I sometimes lose the connection for a moment or off and on depending on where the phone is in relation to the headset. On my bike, I've had pretty good luck with it when the phone is in a pannier on the back of the bike, but sometimes when it's in a bag on my back, I lose the signal. It seems to help when I put my iPhone 4s into the outside pocket of my bag, upside down. Lately, I've done even better by getting a little bag that fastens to the front of the top tube of my bike frame (up by the fork.)Cycling JFLY Roswheel Frame BagIt's meant to hold a phone and not only does it maintain my bluetooth connection but I can actually look at my phone to do things like find out what time it is.The customer support from LG is not very good. I was having trouble pairing my headset with my phone at one point (it just wasn't working) and the LG support site had a list of all these different electronic items so you could find yours and get an automatic service/return request and this headset wasn't on the list so it required actually being on hold and talking to a human and asked some silly questions before being given instructions for sending in the headset (with me paying for shipping.) Then I didn't hear anything from them for a while, then one day my headset showed back up with a note that seemed to be saying I forgot to put my proof of purchase in with the headset so they didn't work on it BUT I tried it again and it seemed to be working so...whatever, I don't know. It's out of warranty now as I write this anyway, so not something I have to worry about any more! At least it's working, but if it wasn't, unless something better has come along in the meantime, I'd probably buy another of this same style because of it's multiple activity uses, general ease of use and fairly long battery life.Oh, I should also mention that I have sweated on it quite a bit and that hasn't seemed to affect it at all.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review162" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-08:</strong> I like these bluetooth head phones.

I bought them because I had broken 3 wired pairs in the past 2 months, all at the base where they plug into my iPhone.  I'm not an audiophile, but I'd say the sounds quality is great; comparable to the $20-$25 headphones that I usually buy and I was surprised that the phone call quality is better than my dedicated Plantronics Discovery 975 bluetooth headset which cost me twice as much.  Though I haven't tried it in a noisy environment yet.  I plan on getting a lot of use out of these as I use them for both work and play so I'll update my review if anything goes wrong or any issues develop.My only issue so far is that I wish it came with some sort of carrying case because they can get caught on things if you throw them in a bag.  I don't want to put undue pressure on the wires.  I think any heavy zip-lock or cloth bag would work for this though so I'm sure I won't have trouble finding something around this size to offer a little protection.On a side note, I don't know where these shipped from, but I ordered using Prime and they were on my doorstep 18 hours later as I was leaving for work, so I have to say I'm very happy with amazon shipping.  One note on the packaging; I saw some reviewers say they had a difficult time opening the packaging, but I found it very easy.  You just cut the 1 inch tape tab on the bottom of the box and it opens like a clam-shell.  No other cutting, pulling or forcing required.  Maybe they heard the complaints and updated the package.UPDATE: After a couple of weeks I'm still really enjoying these.  I've found that they are a little strange to run with so I use regular workout headphones for that, but for work, they are wonderful.  No more keeping a bluetooth headset in one ear and a headphone in the other when I'm expecting a call; I like being able to answer calls on the fly without removing the headphones.  I saw that some people had an issue with an occasional skip in audio.  I do get this occasionally, maybe once or twice a day, but it doesn't really bother me enough to worry about.  I just wish I could get these working with my Windows 7 PC; why doesn't Microsoft include native A2DP support?</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review165" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-24:</strong> I am using this headset for about a month now.It is built well and provides a great sound both for calls and for playing music. It sits very comfortably on your neck and you actually forget that it is there.I was afraid that the ear piece will not fit well in my ears cannel but that concern turned to be not-relevant. They are very comfortable in my ears and can sit there for long time without causing irritation feeling.Another concern that I had was with the connection of the ear piece with the tiny wire to the base of the headset. So far it works fine and proved durable. I hope that it won't tear apart on an accidental pull.The only thing that I would change is the blinking blue light while it operates. It looks wierd (especially if you are in dark environment). I would like to have a way to control it (or at least the pace of the blinking).All together I am very happy with this headset and will definitely recommend it to a friend.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review166" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-19:</strong> I've tried so many Bluetooth Headsets in the last 2-3 years. These I just returned because I see the same thing happening. As with all of the others, they lose the connection thoughout the day. I'm sitting at a desk two feet from the laptop or tablet. And, I've had numerous laptops, tablets, phones etc. - same results - I don't get it. Windows or Mac or Android - or even Nokia - made no difference.I have to conclude Bluetooth is not ready for prime time. And, I will not buy another Bluetooth headset - nope not again. All I need is for the headset to maintain the connection so that I can make and receive skype calls throughout the day - that's it. I don't want to have to reconnect if someone calls or if I want to make a quick call. I don't get it - why can't this be accomplished.And, I really liked these. All the weight is in the part that rests - unnoticed - on your neck. And, when the ear buds fall out - as they inevitably do - they're right there a few inches from your ears so it's fast and easy to reinsert them.It's a brilliant design. And, when it was working - it worked very well. And, for music probably fine - good sound. Good range too.The magnet thing too is super clever. When the ear buds are not in your ears, they naturally get sucked into the ends via some magnets so they don't go flopping around. That's clever.Lastly, in terms of durability, I'm not sure these would have lasted all that long in my backpack anyway. They do seem a little fragile. I'm going to stick with my last set of BT - the Plantronics BackBeat 903+  They also lose connection all the time too but I didn't return those in time. And, they're more ruggedly built and smaller.But, I don't recommend those or any BT headset at this point.  I just bought theBose MIE2i Mobile Headset'wired' headset and I'm thrilled with those - never fall out of my ears - and never disconnect - with excellent sound.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review167" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-18:</strong> I've had this for a while now, and it's great.

Bought the headset to use with myApple MacBook Pro MD311LL/A 17-Inch Laptop (NEWEST VERSION)to listen/control books on iTunes while working out on myNordicTrack Sequoia Skier (Ski Machine). It worked at first. In less than a month the headset was more and more difficult to pair/connect to my MacBook Pro. Sometimes, it would lose connection while in use. It was always visible in the Bluetooth window, but connection was problematic. Repeated switching on & off, and later in time to un-pair/re-pair seemed to help. Yesterday (2APR12) nothing I could do would facilitate connection.

The LG headset is very comfortable, and listeners on the other end of my conversations have said that my voice sounds like I am using a land line.  The ear buds fit nicely.  I agree with other users who have recommended only using one bud and leaving the other ear open - It is better for safety as the buds block much of the external sounds, and being able to switch buds during long calls helps to avoid ear discomfort.The only reason that I am not giving the LG five stars is that I have only had it for about a month, so I can't yet rate reliable quality over the long haul.

With LG scoring massive praise and high reviews, I finally thought I would jump in a deal offered by Newegg. I brought these headphones with me to the Philippines, after testing them for two weeks in Seattle with fairly decent results.At first the range was good with the headphones. I could leave my phone in one room and get up to fifteen feet away while receiving a good signal. Maybe eight feet with a wall between us. This was pretty good, the sound quality was great and noise isolation was acceptable.However, once I arrived in the Philippines I started having larger issues. My phone was unable to play to the headphones without skipping around a lot while I was exercising. Also, I found that the headset itself likes to jump around a lot, resulting in a bruised collar after about a mile of jogging nonstop. This was later partially solved by wearing a shirt with a smaller collar and placing the unit underneath, but I was still unable to listen to music without holding my phone in my hand within three feet of the unit.I became fed up with this after the third week that I've since thrown the headset into my luggage and refuse to acknowledge its pitiful existence. I've tried many things, from charging to testing from alternative sources and it has not given me the performance I was hoping for. And since I don't return back to the US until late April, I doubt I will be able to get a refund/claim on the item.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review187" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-04:</strong> This is the most comfortable in ear headset I have ever used and I have a drawer full.I have used them for almost three months now, every day.

This again is way better than some other headsets I have tried,They last over nine hours of constant use on audio, not sure if phone usage will impact this much.The audio quality is good to very good. They are not top of the line audiophile, but you would not want to use bluetooth for that anyway, right!I like that you use a standard micro USB charger. Less charging cables to take with you on travels.The pair very easily with either my iphone or ipad. Yes, I said either/or. They do not work with both at the same time. The manual clearly indicate that the multipoint functionality is only for one phone profile and one multimedia profile. This is the reason I took off one star. It was not in the online information...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review188" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-28:</strong> I love the concept, and it was very comfortable to wear, but no one could hear me speaking so I returned the item.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review189" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-01-13:</strong> I purchased this item for my husband, who works as a police officer, so while working a road detail, he can listen to his Sirius XM radio on his iPhone 4S and still be able to hear the police radio. He really enjoys it, and says that it is easy to operate. He has about 4 hours of battery life if he is streaming the radio that whole time, which he states, he only had 4 hours of battery life on the phone normally, if he did the same with traditional headphones. The device seems a little odd at first, wearing it around your neck, but it is very light and comfortable. The headphones conveniently store on the ends of the device, so no worries about tangled wires. We have not tried it with Siri yet, but another review stated that it did work with it.Overall, for our needs, this item is perfect!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review190" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-01:</strong> Just what I ordered when I needed them without paying too much at the providers retail store.

I can't do "behind the neck" style as I have a very thick neck, and this I can leave outside my shirt collar.Audio quality is quite good, and battery life is phenomenal. You practically forget it's there. Charge it in the morning, and even if you use it all day you'll only run out of juice just before you go to bed, and that's with HOURS of listening to podcasts, taking and making calls, etc.The magnet tips are very cool as they "take" the ear buds back so they don't wrap around your neck.Two problems, however, marred its existence.1) It only wants to pair to ONE host at a time. I have both a laptop with Bluetooth, and a smartphone. I really want the headset to pair to both so I don't have to swap things back and forth. Unfortunately, this cannot be done with this particular headset. It's either-or, not both.2) Months after purchase and almost daily use, the left earbud broke in half at the seam. Seems the glue just "popped". I glued it back together with superglue, but it seems I lost a wire connection as there's no more sound from the left bud, even though I detect no wire break.Oh, and you'll very likely lose one or both of the "retainer rings" that hooked the wire back to the main loop. I did. It's not critical, but it's likely that you'll end up yanking the wire too hard and thus rip the bud out of the body if you're not careful.For $60 or so, this is a very good stereo headset. It doesn't have the fancy shmancy voice control, status readback, or such, but its phenomenal battery life and comfort makes it worth considering. Just beware of its weaknesses</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review194" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-17:</strong> These bad boys are awesome!

Stays on neck all day without even noticing and is ready to use as needed.  Great quality which allows for flexibility with movements.  Perfect Perfect design with magnet-ed earbuds safely tucked away when not in-use.  Sound quality is great as well and no problems with callers on other end, so microphone also has great location!  Cant believe I waited so long to try Bluetooth, and this headset is proving to be a nice welcome.  Stupid me thought BT had to be glued to ear all day, which kept me away from BT for so long.  No longer will I use wired headsets, the freedom these provide is amazing.  Battery is also superb for my use where I typically charge every other day.  Battery has yet to go completely dead even after using with phone after several days.  I probably use about 1-2 hours MAX of actual talk-time each day.  The only small downside is with Bluetooth enabled on phone most of the day it does cause a noticeable  battery drain on the phone:(  However I'm now getting into habit of turning off Bluetooth on phone during long periods of stand-by and turning back on after answering call.  Sync is a snap with phone, tablet and a GoGroove BT transmitter used for TV's and PC/Netflix while working out.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review201" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-09:</strong> I got these from Fry's about 6 months ago and I LOVE them.

It doesn't give battery notification on iPhone (LG Tone+ 730 does) but I'd rather have the range that this headset has. It's great to be able to play/pause, modify volume, and skip/rewind quickly (without having to dig phone out of pocket and fuddle with menus).

I love how it sits around the neck. Sure, the bass function isn't much of a real bass, and the ear bud cables are just a tad too short. But for me, these concerns have been minor. For design, I'd give 4 stars. After 4 months, it's still holding up well, too, despite numerous drops on the ground and falling asleep many a night with it around my neck!I initially awarded 2 stars for performance, after having the unit for about 3 weeks. It seemed at the time that the range and strength of the Bluetooth radio was lessening significantly. However, this proved to be an issue with my iPhone--not the headset--and was easily solved with a reboot of the phone. So here I am correcting my initial review and going back to a full 4 stars!Update 2013/06/18: Still going strong. My chin sometimes toggles the forward/back rocker on the right side when I turn my head too far and scrunch my shoulders a bit (for whatever reason). It's a minor annoyance. I've pulled off my shirt on many occasions, forgetting that I had the headset on, and had it comes loose and clatter to the floor. No damage to speak of so far.

The hbs-700 can't get much better although I do prefer the hbs-730The range is excellent.  I can usually wander about two rooms away before losing my connection.The sound quality is excellent on phone calls or listening to music.  People on the other end can't tell I'm on a wireless headset.  I also like the magnetic ear bud holders although the bright orange is a little loud.The build quality is excellent, except for the ear buds where they come out of the neck piece.  They need to reinforce the wires.  My hbs-700 headsets have all failed at that specific location.  Regardless, I get very good wear from these headsets.  (typically I've gotten about 6 months out of a headset, 7 days a week 12 -18 hrs a day, running wires, crawling under desks, taking apart computers, replacing hard drives, etc.)I've probably owned 20 different sets of bluetooth headsets.  These are hands down the best bluetooth headsets out there with the exception of hbs-730.  At $60, these LG headsets easily blow away headsets that cost twice as much. They are MUCH better than plantronics, motorola, jabra etc.I've seen some headsets connect by a small wire, and have been tempted, then realized this is a better design.  Here I can take the ear buds out of my ears, and I have a place for them that protects them, but keeps them handy.By the way, the headsets vibrate when a call is coming in, so you can tell your phone is ringing even if the ear buds are in their magnetic holders.If you are looking at the hbs-730, it differentiates itself from the hbs-700 with voice feedback that tells you you've answered a call, or that your bluetooth is connected, or disconnected.  It also vibrates twice when it loses connection with your phone, or gets connected with your phone.The headsets come with 3 different sizes of ear buds, so even the smallest ears and biggest ears will be comfortable.They are a little bit nerdy, but they also command a lot of respect.  I find that when I'm out and about on a very casual Saturday wearing  raggedy shorts, a torn t-shirt, flip-flops, unshaven, and with my long hair down instead of in a pony tail, people still call me Sir and Mr. MyLastName.  I was real surprised to find myself being treated so respectfully until I realized I had my hbs-730 headset on.  I guess it just screams expensive high-tech, so the person wearing it must be a person of means who can afford to look his worst.  ;-)Try them, you'll love them.PS.

I returned the 730 and got another 700 for my wife.  I had a 700 for over 1 year and still love it and working and the tiny wires are still in good shape and I thought it would be torn easily.  Well, I got this 700 last week from a 3rd party seller on Amazon which does the fullfilment and the price was much cheaper, instead of $79, I think it was like $56.  When I got it, the box was torn slightly and must have been opened before.  Charged it and the sound was tinny also but when I tried to do the bass boost, it does not work and there is NO sound or tone reminder going from normal to bass boost and vise versa.  I checked with the first one that I bought and the sound reminder was there.  That is why I think this one is a fake unit, and I have seen them when I was in China.  We I do not understand is that if it is fullfilled by Amazon, why is the box opened and torn.  Something smells fishy.  I can guarantee that there are tons of fake units out there and even selling on Amazon.  Well, i called Amazon and complained and they gave me a discount coupon and I bought another 700 that is sold and fullfilled by Amazon.  This white one is only $44 and the black one is $79!  I do not understand at all.  Finally, I got this white one and everything works, including the bass boost and range is good. So, after weeks or month of trouble I finally got myself, my wife the LG HBS 700.  The form and function for this unit is the best in the market.  Oh, in between I also bought her a Plantronics Backbeat GO2 with sound good but has not vibration alert for incoming call.  I also forgot to tell you that I had bought a white 700 unit from China when I was there and sound good and loud but no bass boost and shorter battery life.  So, stay with Amazon as seller and fullfilment and do the bass boost test!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review211" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-10:</strong> Great product.

I wanted quality while also not spending some absurd amount. These headphones definitely do the job! The battery life is amazing, and the headphones are really comfortable. They also deliver wonderful sound. Bluetooth took maybe a minute to sync with my iphone 5s. I would wear them while golfing sometimes and the Bluetooth would start to cut out around 20-25 feet, but otherwise absolutely no problems ever if phone is kept close by. The only reason I gave these a 4 instead of 5 is because you do still deal with wires, albeit barely. One of the little clips which holds the wire to the main base of the headphones fell off my set right away somewhere without me noticing. I would recommend some sort of way to have the wires extend and withdraw inside of the headphone base, but overall a wonderful product I am very happy with. My final decision was between these and the Motorola type. I may try Motorola next time just because of the aforementioned wire annoyance at times, but if that's not a big deal, you will absolutely love this set!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review217" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-08:</strong> O.K., at first I was disappointed because I thought you had to hold the button down firmly to activate Siri and all that it does is redial the last number you called.

Unacceptable.I might use this headset when going for a run or something (i.e. when audio is coming in), but can't use it for phone calls without bothering my interlocutor.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review221" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-11:</strong> I bought the product because my experience with most Bluetooth headsets is horrible.  Based on user reviews and the overall design I thought this would be the winner.  Well everyone is right about design, audio quality, music features and comfort.  Very well designed and thought out.  The general design of having all controls on the neck band is brilliant and for those who want a great Bluetooth streaming audio headset you will be happy if not delighted.  BUT... how can a company design such a great product in the higher end category and not include a mute button.  I use this for business calls for hours and music on airplanes.  I want all the features.  In business usage I would have traded Bass Boost for a simple mute option.  The only way to mute the mic that I've found is through the handset which kind of defeats the purpose of having hands free headset.  If I'm going to be holding the phone for frequent mute toggle during conference calls, I could just use the speaker phone or a wired headset.  Big disappointment!!!  Small feature that is great for heavy business conf call usage.  Other than that it is a great product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review222" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-07:</strong> These are lightweight and stays charged for a long time.

This feels comfortable around the neck, and is overall non restrictive. Sound is good, and the ability to receive calls is a plus. Magnets were a cool idea too.On the down side, the ear buds are not very comfortable and they are difficult to remove in order to try the other sizes that come with this(actually I am not sure if the are different sizes or extras). Also there is a blue light indicator, for battery charge and other things which would be convenient, HOWEVER the blue light blinks every 30 seconds always when this is on. Not a big deal when in a lighted environment, but if it is dark it is very annoying because you can see it blink and so can others. this is my one major gripe with these earphones.Overall if you are looking for an "ear bud" style bluetooth earphones these are still a good option.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review229" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-28:</strong> I bought these for myself due to my brother's recommendation. Upon use, I found the headset comfortable and very efficient in sound delivery. Charge time took about an hour when completely dead, but usually I would plug it in for about 30 minutes after using it for 8 hours and I wouldn't have a problem with it.On a side note, the headset causes headaches and is interfered with library security systems. When I was going through our school's security system, I heard a slight buzzing. This is due to the interface between bluetooth and another wave frequency (nothing hurtful but something to be acknowledge). For the headaches, this should occur but is a reason why not to but blue too headsets. Bluetooth (when exposed to the nervous system) for extended periods of time, I found that I would have headaches and need to take a break for listening to my music. When I use my bose headset, I listen to music from anywhere of 8 to 14 hours a day. Having your nervous system exposed to a constant frequency is harmful to your body and you should be careful of this.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review230" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-30:</strong> I had high hopes after reading several reviews.

If you're a screaming audiophile you're probably not listening to your phone, but this really, really sounds good. The Bass Boost is even a little too much, depending on what you're listening to.Phone quality: weirdly (to me) one of the best I've used.Controls: well thought-out, spaced and arranged.Convenience: Oh, wow. After a day with it, you'll see what I mean.Battery life: On a full charge, you will get tired before it does.Pairing: You don't really need to read the instructions.So --- what does this gadget need? In a word: COMPLY. Add the comply TX-400 ear tips. I have no idea what the bass gain is, or the noise db reduction is --- but, OH, WOW! Comfortable, great isolation --- just make sure you get the right size. (They have a "sampler" pack, small, medium, large. Find the right one, order the three-pair pack. The whole Comply thing will wind up costing you another $40, if you don't know your size already. Go for it.)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review232" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-18:</strong> Great phone / stereo headset for travel, exercise, workign at computer, anything.As some note - easy to forget it's there.

Bass isn't booming but overall a great set for all I do.I really love the magnetic docking of the ear buds. Keeps them safe; easy to find (and they pop in when even close).I also love the micro-usb charging jack. Everybody who isn't should be migrating to this (like my funky charger / crappy Samsung 460 that was worth the $3 it cost after rebate)For my Android - HTC Incredible - I successfully bound in dual mode and it works great for both phone and stereo audio with one binding.

It's also pretty lightweight, making it very comfortable to wear. The sound quality is excellent for this price and the type of headphones. What's also great is that when you plug them into your ears they also work as ear protectors, since they isolate your ear quite well. Another great feature is the call vibration alert, which makes the headset vibrate in case you get a call. But how is the call quality? Well, I got to say that it's decent. Granted, a phone connection will only provide a certain amount of quality, but that's unavoidable, so no points off there. Also there seems to be very little lag in between the phone (Nexus 5) and the headset, so that's a plus. In terms of battery life, I found that those headphones hold about 10 hours before beeping for power, and that's plenty of time. It also recharges pretty quickly over any micro USB cable, therefore making it fairly practical in case you need to quickly charge it up with your laptop.One thing I did notice though is that you may look a bit weird wearing them because it looks a bit like a collar. But hey, I'm willing to pay that price in order to enjoy wireless freedom.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review236" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-09-02:</strong> All previous reviews are right on the mark, instantly connects with apples ipad 2, however with the ipod touch 4g you need to manually place the headset in pairing mode (with power switch off, press the call button and move the power switch to the ON side all at the same time for four seconds, this should manually pair the ipod touch 4g with your headset, bluetooth headset name shoud now appear in your ipod touch 4g.

I'm generally a bit hesitant to buy LG equipment due to past experiences, but this headset has been amazing so far! I only hope that I can get many years of use out of it. I no longer get discomfort from over the ear headsets (Nokia BH-503) and I don't have the cords that generally come with ear buds. I haven't found a need for custom ear buds the ones included have worked very well for me.After about 4-6 hours, I occasionally get a little discomfort in my ear, but it is usually just because I pushed in the ear buds too hard. Taking them out for 20 minutes and putting them back in more careful generally fixes the issue.I was a little worried about sound quality, but I've been pleasantly surprised. The sound quality on these is much better than my Samsung wired ear buds. It is equal to my Nokia BH-503 over head BT headset but with the comfort of these, they are the clear winners. I also purchased these for family members and they have all loved them so far, even purchasing additional sets for their household.Great design and implementation by LG!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review239" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-06:</strong> I have had a bunch of bluetooth stereo headsets from Jabra to BlueAnt and by far these are the best. Of the 5 different sets of bluetooth headsets I have owned over the years these don't drop the signal or cause static/stutter when the phone is in my pocket, camelbak, or across the room. Every other headset I had would get static or stutter if I had the phone in my left pocket and the headset in my right. They are actually pretty easy to clean, hold a charge for a long time, and are as clear as any bluetooth headset could be. I am not an audiophile and to be honest while I am working out, driving, working, or riding my bike I am not listening for audio quality like you would in setting more suited for that activity. These are light, comfortable, and best of all they work.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review240" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-31:</strong> I purchased the LG HBS-700 Bluetooth Stereo Headset in August 2011 from another retailer. I paid $48.70 with tax. My purpose was to listen to music while driving overnight when everyone else would be sleeping. I know it's against the law to use headphones/headset in both ears in most states but I am an avid mirror watcher so I took the risk. It made my driving duties bearable. And it transmitted Google map driving directions as well. The only drawback to using with Google maps is if you had a long period of time between last transmission/instructions such as long interstate driving it may miss the first part of the transmission. When driving around Chicago using secondary roads it worked very good.This headset sounds better than any cable/wired ear-buds I own. I have the Altec Lansing BackBeat Pro UHP606 with armature micro speakers which ran $99 new, Altec Lansing UHP106 with Ultimate Ears Technology, Skullcandy's Ink'd versions (1) and (2), the Apple earbuds included with the both the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5.Nothing compares to the sound and ease of using the LG HBS-700. The headset sits around your neck resting on your shoulders. You can put your phone in your pocket and control the audio or phone functions without removing it. The only time you would need to hold your phone is if you want to change your audio source such as going from Slacker to Pandora or when you need to make a call. You just can beat the freedom this headset gives you vs. being tethered to your phone by a cable. This makes working out, running or walking a breeze. The earbuds stay in great most of the time even after I start to perspire. The only problem I have had was when I perspired too much after about (3) miles and the play/pause button or fast forward/reverse controls did not work properly. After a few hours they worked again. So this headset is not perspiration proof but it did not suffer a permanent function problem. I wouldn't try wearing them in a rainstorm or they probably would suffer a meltdown.Pairing this headset to a Bluetooth source device is very easy. Takes only about (15) seconds the first time on an iPhone. It automatically pairs about 98% of the time when you turn on the Bluetooth enable source the next time. If it does not pair, I usually just turn off the power and then turn on again. 2% of the time I need to go into Bluetooth setting on the phone and manually pair it. This device has a range of about 30 feet and it works good when leaving a room going into another with walls in between. The headset can also pair over multiple sources/devices. I have a Logitech Bluetooth Boombox which must be manually paired if I am attempting to use it with another Bluetooth enabled device if it was not the last device it had been paired with.One of the BEST features of the LG's is the ability to activate loudness by holding BOTH the volume up and down at the same time WHILE YOU ARE LISTENING TO AUDIO. It will not activate until you hear some type of audio. When activated it beeps in your ear once. The sound just seems to jump at you after activating loudness feature.I still average about (10) hours listening to audio 1.5 years after purchase with the loudness always on before I need to recharge them. It takes between 2-3 hours to charge them fully using the included AC plug. The included AC charger is a 5.1 Volt Output at 0.7 amps. I have also used an AC Apple 5 Volt Output at 1.0 amp sugar cube charger with a USB to micro USB cable I purchased separately. And if on the go with no AC/DC charger, I have used a New Trent IMP50D Portable/External Battery with Output of both 5 Volts at 1 amp and 5 Volts at 0.5 amps using the same USB to micro USB cable. I use the 1.0 amp side to charge the iPhone while also using the 0.5 amp to charge the LG headset. But you cannot use the LG headset while it is charging. I  have also used a Mediabridge Dual USB Car Charger putting out 1.0 amps. This car charger can put out 2.1 amps on one USB but I have not tried to use that one with headset. I use the 2.1 for my iPhone and it charges very quickly. I have experienced no problems with the headset using a source that puts out more than the included AC charger which puts out only 0.7 amps.The headset has controls on both the left and right sides. Those on the left side control volume up/down, a dedicated answer call/hang up call button and as stated above activate loudness function by holding up/down volume controls at same time. You can also use voice commands if your phone supports it by briefly pressing the dedicated answer call/hang up button. Last number redial, just hold the dedicated call answer/hang up button for one second and the headset makes the call for you. And before I forget, the headset vibrates when your phone rings if you are listening to audio. Great idea. The power on/off switch is on the outside of the left arm. The charging port is located on the inner side of the left arm behind swinging mini door. The right side has rewind/fast forwarding tracks and dedicated play/pause button.As far as phone call quality, I have never had a complaint while using this headset as a Bluetooth phone headset. The microphone is built into left side of headset. If you are only using only one earbud for calls use the LEFT side one. Otherwise if the left one is attached via the magnet to the headset it can hamper/block your voice from being heard clearly by the caller on the other end as the microphone sits just behind the left earbud where it attaches by the magnet. As a comparison, I have a top of the line Plantronics 975 Bluetooth headset which can only be used for phone calls. It ran $129 + tax when it first came out and I frequently receive complaints when using it for phone calls.CONS: The included AC Charger wire frayed just behind where the cable goes into the plug and you can see the colored interior cable. I used it only about 20-30 times and wrapped the cable around the charger for storage before it frayed. I taped mine up using electrical tape and it still works. Also where the earbuds sit when attached by the magnets is yellow/orange in color which stands out when you are using the earbuds. I see the new model HBS-730 is gray in color which is an improvement but I wonder why it is not black like the rest of the headset.Last CON is the only way you can see the present charge of the headset is to hold down the left volume control for (3) seconds. A HIGH charge is indicated by a solid blue for one second around the dedicated call answer/hang up button, violet for MEDIUM charge and red for LOW. You can't see percentages anywhere. If you see violet, charge your device immediately is my suggestion. I have gone from violet to red during a 1/2 hour walk and the unit starts beeping in your ear. It beeps more often the lower the charge and just plain turns off when it dies leaving you with no way to listen to audio at all short of your speakerphone on your phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review241" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-19:</strong> For some reason i thought the sound on this device would be better.

Even though I gave them 5 stars, I find they have limitations that may or may not bug others.I try to wear these everywhere I go. I have tried multiple brands and models of bluetooth. I have very small ears, and struggle with earbuds that go in my ears. My most favorite bluetooth model ever, before these, the Motorola H730 sit OVER your ear and have a speaker pointing into your ear... don't protrude into your ear. I had to give them up because they don't stream audio from my iphone. Others, no matter their style, hurt my ears, even with the smallest silicone sized tips.These are just comfortable enough. I'd say for 95% of users, the size of these earbuds won't matter, and the sound quality, easy of uses, LARGE controls, a control FOR EVERYTING WITHOUT sharing 1 button to do multiple functions will keep you happy with your purchase. On top of that, the battery seems to last forever, they vibrate when a call comes in, and you can barely tell they are there when not in use. Stereo sounds great, using just 1 earbud works great. Lots of volume. No one has EVER complained or mentioned mic quality when on calls.I have been using them for 2.5 months and no one has ever commented on "what is that around your neck." I always wear collared shirts and tuck them under the collar, or inside my shirt.I have these few complaints- the magnets aren't strong enough and the earbuds are too large to lay on comfortable in bed (I know, who does this?). With just a casual bump, the earbuds fall out of their home. This has yet to irk me, but I think it might bother others. There are these cool, breakaway cable holders that make the earbuds easy to find if not in their home and yet let the cable go in case you catch them on something. Like I said, I have very small ears. To keep from bugging my wife, I use earbuds in bed before sleep. I can't use these because the earbuds themselves are quite large. I use Altec Lansing blitz earbuds for bedtime, and when and if these earbuds die, I'll soilder(sp) the smaller earbuds onto the wires. Like I said, it doesn't bug me when the earbuds don't lock in to their home, so this change won't bother me if I ever need to do it.Orange is ugly, but a sharpie will fix this.Work great on walks and in the car. I will only replace for use in the car when Motorola comes up with a newer, streaming model of H730s. You listening, Motorola?You won't regret buying these, especially if you like to have a seperate on off switch, a seperate answer call/end button, a seperate play/pause button, a seperate up and down rocker switch (switches actually), and individual next and last track controls.It did take a while to sort out its use with my car's stereo... which I use to stream my audio through a cable. Once connected to the car stereo, the ipod audio comes out the car stereo. When I take a call, I have to be carefull to answer using the button on the headphones. If I answer on the phone, I hear the person over the speakers, but there is no mic (my stereo doesn't have a mic). If I answer with the earbuds, I can talk and listen to the caller on the earbuds. Then, unforetunately, I have to manually select the car stereo on a menu on my iphone to resume listening there. Not a huge problem, I don't take a lot of calls in the car. I can also just toggle power to the LGs to regain car stereo audio.You can't charge these and use these at the same time... not rare on bluetooth headsets, but regretable I guess.These are great if you are in and out of your car alot. Just listen to music or audiobooks via the LGs, then you have little or no interuption as you get in and out of your car as the battery lasts forever.Lastly, if I had a very important meeting, the earbuds fit in my pants pocket.. I'd hate to do that regularly as it could break the cables. Would work great in a purse I suppose too.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review243" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-21:</strong> This is the best Bluetooth headset on the market today.

She required discreet headphones, as these are, and good quality sound in order to hear her music over the loud equipment.  This headset met all the criteria.  Phone audio quality is excellent for both the user and the person on the other end.  Coolest feature is that the unit vibrates on incoming phone calls and places streaming music on pause so you can answer the phone call.  Extra comfortable (and super lightweight) sitting on neck, not even noticeable.  The only problem so far...I have not been able to get the 'text to speech' app (provided by a third party and available for free in the Android market) to install.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review246" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-18:</strong> If you are busy moving around while you are working or doing physical labor (such as my boyfriend) or even if you are at the gym.

Only thing that has broken is the plastic clip to shorten the cord on one earbud, but I replaced it with a small craft/braces style rubber band and it works fine to shorten the cord and take strain off the connection to the neck band.

But get this: the earbud cords that connect to the unit are just a little lightweight and rubbery. I can tell from the type of material used that these are designed to be sweatproof and should age well, but you'll need to treat them with a bit of respect to avoid tangles, kinks and outright breakage.Sound quality is good enough. I won't pretend to be an audiophile, but I have owned two sets of Sennheiser lanyard-style headphones for previous MP3 players that received excellent reviews for their fidelity, and I have to say that I can't tell a bit of difference versus some stock earbuds that I own -- not when I'm outside, walking the dogs at the park. These LGs are just fine.They're lightweight, and although I thought they'd be uncomfortable (or maybe just annoying) to wear around my neck, they really just "disappear." I just have to make sure to set the sliding cord retainers close to the "pods" on the neck piece, so as to avoid the buds from pulling out when I turn my head.Charging is quick via the included micro USB -- unfortunately via a port that's covered by a tethered plastic piece that I'm accustom to breaking off after a limited number of uses. Power is handled by a slider switch on one side; volume is handled by an appropriately sized rocker switch on the other. The pause/play button and FFWD/RWD rocker works with Google Music, but not Pandora.I love the concept of the magnetic earbud holders at the ends of this thing, but wish they were stronger. And the magnets don't solve the problem of the loose cord, which is left to snag on something if not stored and handled with respect.Nice sounding headset; a pleasure to be free from the cord!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review250" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-24:</strong> I love this freakin' thing so much!

As in my other reviews I will focus on the music experience as I use my Motorola T305 for hands free calling.  After pairing this unit with my Droid X, I evaluated it for sound quality, ease of use, and comfort.Sound Quality:  I don't have the strictest standards for music listening, but I haven't had many better listening experiences that I have with the 700.  After changing out the earbuds for the larger set to get a good fit, I was ready to go.  I can't emphasize enough the importance of getting a good seal between your ear and the earbud for sound quality.  I have had this wrong on other earbuds in the past, and the difference in sound quality is night and day.  For clarity of playback the only thing that I have gotten better sound from is my Creative Zen X-Fi with the EP-830 earbuds.  While the 700 doesn't produce booming base, it is rare that earbuds do.  By comparison I think that the 700 has better sound than either the Motorola or Jabra units that I have used.Ease of Use:  This is an area where I think LG has really scored.  The 700 has a dedicated on/off switch, and each of its controls does exactly one thing.  There are dedicated buttons for play/pause, skip, and reverse for controlling your music player.  In addition there are dedicated volume and call buttons too.  Once you learn which side the controls are on, it is very easy to control the 700 without being able to see the controls.Comfort:  If you have used earbuds with no issues in the past, you should have every reason to expect the 700 to be of similar comfort.  I have listened for an hour and a half without giving any thought to the headset I was using.  The unit itself rests like a necklace around your neck.  The only potential issue I could see is that people with long hair may find that it gets tangled in the unit.  If you are concerned about this, I would recommend checking out this unit in person.  As of this writing you can do so at a Sprint store.The one caution I would issue would be around active use.  I don't think the unit is designed to hold up to bouncing around, and it also does seem to be sweat resistant either.  I would recommend the Jabra Clipper for active use.  However I use the 700 while sitting at my desk at work.  It does fine with normal walking around and light activity.  I would just refrain from using it during exercise.Overall:  The LG HBS-700 is a very strong offering.  It hits the mark on sound quality, ease of use, and comfort.  The only downside I see to it is that it was not designed for using during exercise.  Otherwise I think that you will be happy with this unit.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review261" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-20:</strong> This headset was very easy to pair and connect to my media player, as well as my phone.The sound on it is good. I am listening to music on them right now despite the fact that I have a surround sound system that cost close to $2,000. Ok it's mostly because I don't want to wake up my wife and daughter, but the sound is pretty good for a headset.I did make a couple phone calls and the persons voice came through well, and they could hear me like normal. They said it didnt sound any different than when we normally talk on the phone.Having this resting around my neck is comforatable so far. It is very light, i can easily forget it's there at all.There are some buttons on either side of the headset near where the earbuds would stick to for the volume and an on/off switch.One kind of annoying thing to me, just a little one is that while the cords to the earbuds in my ear are long enough to easily reach my ears; i find that if I turn my head to much it will cause the earbud to be pulled out.I would have enjoyed them being an inch or so longer, or having a retractable cord inside the plastic.  It is more than ok though, and this is a very minor thing to me, but it is somewhat irritating and I wanted to let others know.  it kind of makes me think of having my neck on a brace in the sense that I am unable to turn it to much without causing myself trouble.Overall I would recommend this to anyone else who needs or wants a blutooth headset for hands free calls while driving, or listening to music while you run or what not.I personally am happy with this product so far, and would buy it again.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review262" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-24:</strong> I have to say that I just love these Bluetooth Stereo Headset.

I purchased it to be able to listen to various audio streams throughout the day at my desk, while mowing the lawn, while working on projects, and performing other tasks.  My only complaint about it is that if I have multiple devices which have been connected to it, it proves very difficult to select which device is connected.  It also will split connection between various devices, one for phone audio, another for media audio.  I have other bluetooth devices which will accept both inputs from multiple sources simultaneously.  That feature would be the best possible improvement for this unit.Other than that issue (which is a derivative of my usage of it) it meets or exceeds my expectations.  Battery life is quite reasonable, I use it for several hours every day, and only have to charge it every other day.  Once it's on my neck, I quickly forget that it's there.

They were, so I thought, everything I wanted them to be. They were comfortable, light weight, could be easily tucked away when not in use, they were great. There were a couple of issues though. If my phone was in my back pocket, somehow that interrupted the signal and it would fade in and out significantly.I lived with that issue though as the solution was, don't put it in my back pocket. I could accept that. A few months later though, the left ear phone started getting a little &#34;staticky&#34; for lack of a better term. Well about two weeks or so ago, I discovered a short in that ear bud. If I wiggle it around and hold it just right, I can get sound out of it, otherwise though, it is silent. I'm still tolerating it as I usually only use one side anyway (although it used to be the left for the most part). The right one now though is starting to do the same as the left did. I'm pretty sad about it.I really wanted them to work. The concept is fantastic, but the connections to the ear buds seems to be lacking in the sturdiness department. If you get them, tape that area down or something so that it stays put, that way you hopefully won't end up in the same boat as me.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review281" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-30:</strong> Have been using this headset mainly to listen to music about 2 hours daily at the gym for a few weeks now with no problems. I replaced a Phillips over the ear waterproof headset, which failed after about 5 months. The LG has better sound quality, longer battery life, MUCH more comfortable fit, and due to the design has larger thus useable buttons. I pair with my Samsung Focus WP 7.5 and they sync fast and have good range. On occasion I get a phone call and the large buttons make answering a breeze, and the mike being around your neck makes for excellent voice quality, I do notice the callers voice volume is a bit lower than the music level but still ok for easy conversation. I charge them every 2 to 3 days, so not sure how long the charge last in terms of hours.The con's:  They only come with one set of spare rubber cups and they are the same size. They are little large for my ear canals, but stay in place once I get them in there. They say they are waterproof (I guess they mean the speakers), but the cover over the charger port doesn't seem to be at all waterproof and is positioned so once you start sweating it lays right against my sweat soaked tee shirt collar, so far no problem but long term???They look like they would be cumbersome hanging around your neck but you really are unaware they are there unless you look in the mirror then they look a little geeky.For the price I don't see how you could beat them.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review282" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-27:</strong> No more long cord hanging out and grabbing everything I walk by!

I am rating the LG HBS-700 ($45.99 w/free prime shipping). We had the MOST difficult time getting the bluetooth to work with our phone. Upon initial connection, the bluetooth paired seamlessly. Our issue was it would not stay connected. It would disconnect every 15 - 30 seconds and simply say "bluetooth disconnected" but would reconnect right away, only to be disconnected again. This was so very frustating! I did some internet research outside the Amazon forum and found that there is a known problem with the HTC and LG interface. There's supposed to be a software push to fix the bug but that obviously hasn't happened yet.Here's how we resolved the issue:1. Wi-Fi has to be turned off on your phone2. Restart Phone3. Voila! Bluetooth Disconnect issue is resolved!I hope this review saves someone the frustration we went through. We returned 3 headsets before the light bulb came on to do some online troubleshooting. I purchased this for my husband because he loses standard bluetooth's too easily. This was the perfect solution for him because it is covert and I don't have to worry about him losing it. He loves it and says it's very comfortable. I think this is the best bluetooth on the market currently if you can avoid the connection issues or work around them.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review284" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-17:</strong> Nice, easy, comfortable and great sound - with a great range of around 80 ft for me so far, and that was in an office thru at least one wall.

This time, I needed this faster than I would be able to get it via mail - so I bought it from a retailer and paid $10.00 more for it than if I had bought it from Amazon (sorry for going to another retailer on this one Amazon).I am using this product (mainly) on an iPhone 3GS.I am in LOVE with this product.My boss allows me to use my iPhone to listen to podcasts and watch movies (in the background) while I work (as long as I do my job and stay productive!).  Recently, a co-worker moved near my work area and didn't like some of the things that I listen to.  So I went to earbuds.  Worked out great, but the wires were in my way.  So I needed a wireless audio solution.Being a very technical person - my first thought was that if you TRANSMIT something - there will be a DELAY.  So I was concerned that audio/video would not sync up properly.After much research - I chose this product.Turned out to be a GREAT choice!  The audio/video has ZERO delay issues.  Now I HAVE seen a delay problem a FEW times.  I've only had this problem AFTER pairing the device with ANOTHER source.  Something gets out of sync. - but if you go to settings (on the iPhone) and disable the device and then re-enable it - the delay disappears.Now then - a few pro's and con's:Pro's:1.  EASY PAIRING.  My iPhone paired with it quickly and easily.2.  Charges FAST - I think I had it on the charger for around 10 minutes.  The light went out (indicating full charge) and I thought 'wow!  Really?  Already?'.3.  Long battery life.  I haven't had them long enough to say for sure - but they advertise 10 hours of play time.  I've been on them at LEAST 6 hours now and they are doing fine.4.  Very comfortable.Con's:1.  The audio quality is better than expected for a bluetooth device - BUT  - They do NOT match my sony earbuds.  They don't have quite the bass "thump" or clarity.  That said - the sound quality IS impressive for a wireless device and it is beyond acceptable - I'd even repeat that impressive is the right word for the audio.2.  There is no 2.  And con number 1 is very minor unless you are a die-hard audiofile.  The sound quality is beyond what I expected for a wireless device.Hope this review helps.  And to anyone who doesn't need it as fast as I did - you SHOULD buy from Amazon.  They have the best price.- Ron*** Added Information ***Ok - it hasn't ever charged QUITE as fast as the first time.  I'm thinking that the thing had a charge when I bought it.  Still, it charges at a reasonable rate.  I used it ALL DAY today and it re-charged in around an hour.  Not bad.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review291" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-09:</strong> I wear this all day to listen to music and to take conference calls(iPhone).

I love the fact that I can just put this headset on around my neck, and leave them on throughout the day.  I wear collared shirts to work, so the headset is mostly concealed by my shirt.  I am a large guy with a 22" neck, and these fit just fine.  My 11 year old son also wore them one day in the car, and they fit his narrow neck just fine too.  These truly are one-size-fits-all.Design - I must give props to the design team here.  This is a very unique take on the stereo bluetooth headset, and I applaud them.  They need to address a few issues on the next model of these though.  The magnetic clips are fantastic, but could stand to be a little stronger.  My earpieces spend more time disconnected from the magnet than they do connected.  Not a big deal, since there is only so far they can stray because of the wire length.  They need to make the cables more durable.  I have worn mine daily for only a little over a month, and I have wires exposed at 3 different points.  The cable insulation can rub off VERY easily.  I have had to resort to "liquid electrical tape" to reinforce those areas.  This could also be partly remedied by a re-designing of the departure angle of the cable from the body of the unit.  The cables come out of the unit at almost a straight 90 deg. angle instead of a lower angle, causing more stress on the cables.Battery Life - Stellar.  I consistently get 9.5 to 10 hours of continuous listen / talk time.  Are there any other bluetooth headsets out there with a 10 hour talk time rating?Call Quality - The call quality is not that bad.  It takes getting used to having a phone conversation in stereo, but I got used to it.  All callers said I was very easy to hear, but that a lot of background noise could be heard.Sound Quality - The sound quality was just mediocre to me.  Don't buy these if you want a full sound stage for your music, or if you consider yourself an audiophile.  Buy these for the convenience and the massive talk / listen time.  the phone calls sounded great, but my music (many different styles) sounded shallow, lacking any low-end sound stage.  I even jammed the earbuds in to my ears tightly to see if there was any more bass that could be heard.  None that I could tell.Controls - Very easy to learn and use.  This is the first time that the button placement makes sense to me.  Basically all of your call controls come from the left side, and your music controls are on the right.  I love the fact that there is a slide power switch instead of a "push & hold" power button.Summary - I like these alot, but I don't think they are going to last very long.  The exposed wiring through the cable insulation makes me think these will have a very limited life-span.  Overall, I like these much better than my Plantronics Back Beat 903+'s.  I like the ear buds on these versus the traditional "on-ear" style of bud that Plantronics uses.  Get these if you want a convenient wireless headset with copius amoutns of talk/listen time, but aren't that concerned with overall sound.  They sound good, but not near as good as other wired earbuds.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review295" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-01:</strong> Features and sound quality are great.

At the two month mark, the earpiece cracked and the earbud fell off. I went through 4 or 5 LG Customer Service sources - all which did not have this product listed but insisted you put in certain information that made it very difficult. I finally spoke with someone that told me how to return the product - and that if they determined it was my fault they would tell me how much to fix. BTW, I paid to have the product shipped back.Today I received the product back via Fedex - in the condition I sent it. They determined the break was my fault (it wasn't) and that they could not quote a fix, or a replacement, or a remanufactured replacement. They simply said I was out of luck - LG in effect just said "we are not honoring your warrantee and will not even find a way to try to make you whole".  There was no appeal, no nothing - they decided.I am glad my run in with LG was over a $50 product - I will now know not to buy an LG TV, phone, etc. because I do not want to get stuck with a $2000 TV that LG says "sorry about that 1 year warrantee but weve decided we cant fix or replace your product".DO NOT BUY LG..</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review332" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-03:</strong> Much more comfortable for me than the behind the head ones.

But I find the biggest issue as being...where do I put it when not using it?- Motorola makes amazing sweat proof stereo headsets, but they are rather large, and frankly, if you're not working out, there's in the way.- Many other BT headsets suffer from an inability to connect quickly as you jump from device to device, and while I'm sure there are several exceptions out there, I've never found one.- One thing that is always frustrating:  I'd like to watch videos or listen to music on my iPad, but still answer calls from my cell phone, and it's been annoying that many BT headsets don't have this function.- BT antenna strength has been a problem for me on almost every stereo BT headset, with several intermittent dropouts while listening to music or on a call.If the above are annoyances you have struggled with, then the LG HBS700 may be just the ticket for you.The HBS700 is a bit of a godsend and fairly close to what I would consider an ideal headset.- First off, the BT electronics is separated from the canal phones.  This alone is a huge advantage.  It allow for larger electronics that don't annoy you while listening to music.- Next, the canal phones have magnetic slots to sit in when not in use.  What a great idea!  having a place to put the canal phones when not in use means they're not dangling and more importantly, don't get tangled.- The larger electronics means bigger battery than other stereo BT headphones, and that's a major plus as you can use it all day.- The unique multi-connection means I can watch videos on my iPad, or listen to music from my laptop, and still have it "cell" connected to my iPhone to answer calls if need be.  It'd be better if it could do calls on two devices, then I could Skype on one and still answer calls from the cell.  - Still, this feature is pretty amazing.- And it connects fast....I mean, really fast.  I can jump from device to device and discoveries occur within a few seconds and connection another 2-3 seconds.  I can't even imagine how many times I've been annoyed with switching devices.- I've broken or lost more single ear BT headsets than I can count.  Always because I have no place to really put the headset when not in use, what's more, I've missed many calls because the BT headset is buried in my shirt or pants pocket and hard to get out in time.  This can't be stressed enough from my perspective.  These things are never in my ear when not in use, but quick to get in my ear and answer calls.- The antenna is strong, also probably because of the larger electronics in the neck band.five small annoyances:- The neck band is weighted slightly on the right, which always gives a lopsided look.- the rear of the band is too flexible.  I get why they did that, to maximize comfort, but there's a fine balance there, and they err'd on the side of too flimsy, rather than too firm.  Not quite perfect.- The magnets are too weak.  Here again, it's a balance issue.  Too strong would also be annoying, but they could have made it stronger.- Sound quality.  Disagree with just about everyone else here.  The sound quality is just soso.  Good enough, but hardly what I'd call great.  Maybe "good" but even that is a bit of a stretch.  Not complaining, mind you, but not ideal by any means.- durability is a major issue with these.  You might get more than a year's use out of them, but don't expect it.  Be happy with 6 months.All in all though, the good far far outweighs the bad, and these will be my new favorite BT headphones for a some time to come.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review342" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-23:</strong> This is a great product and they are the best that I have used so far.  I use these for running and biking and when I am working on things around the house.  I went through 2 different bluetooth headphones before I tried these.  The other two headsets would constantly give me static when I was listening to music and that was unacceptable so I took them back.Pro's:Sound Quality - Music, Audio Books and Phone calls all work wellVolume - Easy to hear music even with substantial back ground noiseEase of use - It is very easy to sync this to your phone and control volume or skip a song even while runningComfort - When they are on they are fairly comfortable,Con's:Earbuds fall out when I run - this isn't a huge concern, but they fall out every 4-5 minutes and it gets a little annoying.Construction - While they are still working great and I have no issues yet they seem like they may fall apart because of how thin the wires on the buds are.  I purchased these less than a month ago and they are working well so far. I will keep this updated as to how long they work for me.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review343" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-29:</strong> Love this thing... replaced my motorola headset with this after losing the second one again.

Since then I've tried numerous models, some good, some bad (some real bad).  When the original iPhone came out in 2007, my hunt for a good Bluetooth headset got more serious.  I've tried many of them (Jabra, Morotola, Lubix, Jawbone, Plantronics, etc.) and wasn't happy with any of them.  My last one was Plantronics 975 because I gave up finding a stereo headset that I could be happy with.  It was okay for calls...it was small but I'm not one of those that parade around with a headset in my ear all day, so I had to always find a place to keep it handy to answer calls (and no I didn't want to use a lanyard)So while perusing Amazon last week, I came across this one by chance (honestly I didn't know LG even made them).  I immediately ordered one and got it very next day.  After using it for almost a week, both indoors and outdoors, I have to put this one on top of my list of all time favorite list.  Here are the pluses:- Since all the weight is in the housing that goes around your neck, only thing that goes into your ears is the buds so it's very light and comfortable to have it on.- It comes with 2 sets of ear buds.  I had to use the larger ones for more snug fit.- The whole unit is still light so right after putting this around your neck, you forget you have it around you (funny, this is also a minue).- Works great with Siri (was my biggest concern)- Reception is very good.  I can walk from my home office to the kitchen (~35ft and two walls) and still can have a conversation.- You don't have to memorize a series of complex sequences to use the controls.  It comes with a separate on/off slidern switch, volume up/down, call/answer button (you also use this to invoke Siri) on the left side.  On the right has play/pause button and prev/next track controls.  It only took me 15 minutes to get familar with these controls.- The unit is very comfortable and flexible.- More opportunity to listen to your music without worrying about missing calls...plus you don't look weird wearing it because they look more like stereo music headphones.- It's sleek and easy to conceal it under the collar of your collared shirt.  Just the ends will produce slightly.- The earbuds are magnetized so they snaps into the end of the housing.Now the minuses:- It's so comfortable and light that you forget you have them on. especially when you have the buds stored.- The microphone is located in the left side near the end, so when you have the buds stored it, it blocked by it.- I wish I can turn off the small blue light ring (around the call button).  It does attract attention especially indoors.- If you push the call button slightly longer, it redials the last number (called my boss a couple times...embarrasing).  I wish they made it a little longer.- It does not have noise-cancellation so when using it outdoors, Siri sometime didn't work as expected (but Siri is still Beta).All in all, I'm very happy with this unit.  I think this is by far the best bluetooth headsets you can have for your iPhone 4S.  I highly recommend it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review345" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-21:</strong> These are excellent earbuds.

Aside from having big hands, I have a large neck.  The device around the neck takes a little to get used to.  It's a little snug but not horrible.The charge last for days of about 2-3 hours usage a day.

Each one having issues that makes them almost unusable to me. This LG HBS-700 set has surprised me by being near perfect for me. I can hide it under my collar, or under my over shirt so it is almost invisible. It has an excellent battery life. I can listen to my audio books all day, and it hasn't died on me yet. It never fails to connect, and has excellent audio quality.My only gripes are the flashing light, and the ear bud tips don't fit my ear correctly. The light has been fixed by a piece of electrical tape over the button (which does make the button a bit harder to use, but it's not bad) and the second issue is fixed by merely putting a larger tip on the ear bud. I happened to have some tips from an older set of skull candy ear buds I had laying around, and now they work great for me. Both negatives are easily fixed, and weren't a huge deal in the first place.If I ever break these, I'm ordering another pair.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review347" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-23:</strong> I had these recommended by a business associate and I really like them.

You can seat the buds securely in your ears to block out most noise or seat them loosely to allow you to hear ambient sounds.  You can use only one bud at a time.  You can answer the phone from the neck collar as well as control volume and hang up.  It pairs with everything I've tried, including iOS, Android and a MacBook Pro.  Great for listening to music or movies in bed.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review354" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-05:</strong> Really good product, one should buy it!

This is more comfortable since it doesnt float behind the head causing physical interference. The sound is nice but not as much Bass as the Motorola but plently loud. I wish I could change the earbud sizes, as I loved the large buds on the Motorola that would eliminate outside noises. The buttons were easy to get used to but there is too long of a delay ending a call(at least 5 seconds) after you've pressed the "hang up" button. I do prefer this over the Motorola mostly due to comfort as sometimes I can forget I have them on.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review361" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-03:</strong> I love this little gadget.

It was a gift for my wife for when she takes her afternoon walks.  She never has to hold her iPhone and have an annoying wire flailing about.  She just keeps her phone in her pocket and kick out that playlist.  It is so comfortable to wear that sometimes you just wanna keep using it until the battery dies, but that's not a problem.  This pair of headsets lasts forever on a light to moderate use.  I use it 40hrs a week and a few extra hours in between for making and taking calls.  I've also recommended this to a few of my colleagues and they swear they'll never buy another pair of BT headset but the LG HBS-700.  I'm looking to purchase another one just in case.  If you're a music lover and use bluetooth headsets to make and take calls all the time and your're tired of all the ultra expensive, uncomfortable units out there and don't even come close to this one, then look no further because THIS IS IT!The one thing that makes this an outstanding bluetooth headset are the earpieces.  It's exactly as the wired headset with noise cancelling features, the in-ear types, so it just fits perfectly.

If I'd realized how great these were, I would have purchased them for myself a long time ago.In the few days I have had them, I've easily used them for several multi-hour sessions (watching movies at night on my Tablet or music on my phone) with NO discomfort. In fact, I find it difficult to find earbuds small enough to comfortably fit my ears for more than a half an hour, but the default installed earbuds fit perfectly! (There is a second, larger set included).On top of that, at night I put on a movie or show on Netflix to fall asleep to, but wear headphones so as to not wake my spouse. Prior to receiving these, my favorite set have been a wired set of Vizio, which, if I rolled to my side, would become uncomfortable in the ear pressed into my pillow, and are often yanked out as the wire would get tangled up as I rolled around in my sleep.These have such a low profile in the ear that there is no pressure or discomfort when laying on my side. Even more impressive is that they remain in place even after moving around in my sleep. I just remove them on my first arousal after falling asleep. Even after using them the night before, I can use them the following day for several hours before recharging them for the next night.Ultimately, I returned this pair (HSB-700) for the similarly (and through some Amazon vendors, even more cheaply) priced Tone+ (HSB-730). I was stunned that the 700 does not include a microphone Mute function on the headset. There are a lot of very convenient control buttons, but found this to be an odd oversight. The HSB-730 includes a microphone mute, a vibration setting, and an increase to the already impressive battery life.PROs:+Extremely comfortable.+Good sound quality.+Great range.+Impressive battery life.+FANTASTIC VALUENEUTRAL:=The thin wire connecting the earbuds to the base may not be as durable long-term as some heavier-duty wired earbuds.=SMS Text Reader app was not personally tested, but Android Play Store reviews seem to indicate that the required app is hit or miss based on your specific device.CONs:-Surprising lack of a microphone mute feature.-Obsolete?

I would purchase them on this feature alone. The battery life is excellent allowing you to use the headphones for an entire workday. They have a small operating range beginning to drop out at approximately 15 feet (not the range I have gotten on similar devices) and this will cause problems with many devices that simply reconnecting will not always fix. All that aside, I've never worn a more comfortable and better sounding bluetooth audio device.However, it has a flaw.The microphone is the weakest point on the device. It clear but has very poor gain. The result is that you will be hard to hear on any phone calls you take with this device. The microphone also drops out on occasion and that can be annoying on long calls. While the sound is clear and sharp it is very very very faint. This one critical flaw has me looking for a second device to use for phone calls, one with a better microphone.All said, I'm happy with the purchase but I'm looking for a different device for managing phone calls. I would appreciate a similarly designed device with a boom microphone I could place next to my mouth.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0052YFYFK" id="B0052YFYFK-review369" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-18:</strong> I purchased these wireless headphones after seeing a bunch of store reps and a colleague of mine wearing them.

It fits my phone well and actually takes a bit of effort to remove - so I know it won't just pop off inadvertently. I did have an incident where the phone itself came out of holster and fell on the floor - it doesn't appear to have suffered any damage. So it would appear the phone doesn't fit snugly enough into the holster. However, I think if it were any more "snug", it would make it a struggle to remove it when you need. I prefer, and have always used carrying cases over these snap-on covers but I couldn't find one when I was purchasing the phone. I have since found several good ones so I'll snap on the cover when my wife is using the phone (she's a bit careless about handling the phone), and I'll get the carry case for me</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005E06WE4" id="B005E06WE4-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-24:</strong> Comparing it to the plastic hard case from Verizon - info that would have helped me when I was looking at cases. :)I got the Droid 3 when it first came out and cases were limited, so I got the pricey Verizon plastic fitted case. It worked fine, but once removed one of the little 'tabs' broke on the top piece. I found this Holster case and decided to try it out - it's awesome! It's like the pricey plastic fitted hard case but better! It fits the same way, but it's easier to 'grip' and I'm less likely to drop it when carrying other things. The case is much 'sturdier' compared to the plastic case and the case fits snugly but goes on easily (much easier than the plastic case had). The keyboard slides out perfectly and feels 'tight' and more controlled than it did without it. It fits in the holster nicely and is easy to remove when I need it. The holster clips on me easily and is also easy to remove. The little case stand works great too!Overall, this is the best case I've had for any phone (and I've had many!). HIGHLY recommend it!Editing to add on July 2nd, 2012: I still LOVE THIS CASE. I've had to remove it a few times now, it's simple to remove and put back on and doesn't break! The case is super strong so dropping it truly protects it. And the little 'stand' is amazing! I have to see if they make this case for Ipod Touch and hope they make it for other phones for when I get a new one next year. I would honestly miss the case more than the phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005E06WE4" id="B005E06WE4-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-27:</strong> This is absolutely expensive in a Verizon store, but is a fraction of the price on Amazon.

I bought it for that reason alone, and it has been worth every penny just for that feature. The shell-holster feature is sturdy and provides good protection for your phone, while also allowing conveniently keeping your phone easily available on a belt or something similar. Solves the problem of trying to decide which pocket to carry it in, or the difficulty locating your phone by rummaging around in your purse. The only (minimal) downside is that the shell does add a bit to the size/weight of the phone, but I have found it not to be a significant drawback. If the phone is already at the limits of size/weight that you find acceptable, then it might be a factor to consider. The case does have a "decorative" pattern that some might find terrific, while others might not care for it. So do check the pictures. This is an actual Motorola/Verizon product, for which you would pay more buying it from them. Overall, I'm very pleased with this item.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005E06WE4" id="B005E06WE4-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-03:</strong> Liked this style of holster so much when I upgraded to droid razr maxx, I went with the same style.

Sure enough...that person was right. I used a nail file (not the metal kind), and it worked brilliantly. You only need to file the middle latch. The ones on the edge don't impede on performance. The last thing that I don't like is that after you put it on, be very careful to take it off. You have to finagle it off, because if you try to be quick with it, you might damage the sliding screen. It's finicky.The good: VERY sturdy. Nice design. Feels good in the hand. All ports are very accessible. Doesn't create much extra bulk. The kick-stand is BRILLIANTLY designed. I was concerned it would be junk, or poorly executed. Nope. One of the best kick-stand designs I've seen.I don't use the holster. If I did, I would probably never use it in the horizontal position. It looks as though the phone would just slide out given the right circumstance. Vertically I don't see that it would be a problem. If I decide to use it for whatever reason, I'll add to this.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005E06WE4" id="B005E06WE4-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-21:</strong> Not good.

But I had to return them, because they did not fit my ears.I have grown very particular about how "in ear" headphones fit my ears. These Bose headphones come with three different sized earpieces. Unfortunately, none gave me a solid, secure fit.I have found that the dome-shaped silicone earpieces fit my ears best. For example, check out theMotorola ROKR E8 High Quality 3.5mm Black Color Stereo Handsfree Headset with Answer Button. Note that I am not recommending the Motorola product, just pointing you there to look at the ear pieces. Notice the simple bowl shape that fits inside your ear canal. I find that this shape blocks external noise, stays in my ear, and gives the best audio quality. Unfortunately, these Bose earphones use a different shape which may fit some people, but not me. I also noticed that even if they did fit, they probably do not block noise as well as the bowl shaped ones that fit in the ear.Sound quality appeared good, but my test was short because of the fit problem.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002GZ1IRG" id="B002GZ1IRG-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-08-11:</strong> So, you just got your new iphone 3gs. Too bad the headphones that came with it are trash. What are you going to do? Well, you could get the Bose mobile headset or one of the Shure mobile headsets. I tried the dj beatz headphone which is very uncomfortable. Then, I decided I needed a mic and my options were narrowed down for me. These headphones have good bass but, not as good as beatz headphones though. However, it's a 100% more comfortable and the bass is good too. Believe me when I say I would have returned it with the quickness if the bass wasn't good.

I also want to be able to take phone calls without having to unplug the headset, which is what you have to do if you use a headset without a microphone. While the headset that comes with the Tour is adequate in terms of sound, I had trouble keeping the earpieces in place when I went running. Not so with the Bose, which also has better sound.The trick with any more advanced headset is to make sure you use the correct size ear insert, and that you position the earphones correctly. Everyone's ears are different, so not every headset is for everyone. Having said that, the Bose comes with three different size ear inserts, and for me the largest size works like a charm. These earphones are easy to insert, feel comfortable, and most important for me stay in place while I run. WARNING: Like many headsets, these are NOT water resistant, so if you wear them while exercising and sweat a lot, common sense says that you must towel off your ears occasionally so you don't zap these earphones with moisture. I have already ruined otherwise perfectly fine headsets by forgetting to do that.The sound quality is far superior to the headset that came with my Tour. However, if you are not going to use these with a mobile phone, then for the money I would get something else, like a Shure E3C, which I think has a cleaner and crisper sound. But for mobile phone use, I have not found anything better than the Bose.Although this headset is not designed to be a noise reducer, as a practical matter I don't hear the ambient noise in the gym when I use it. But I do have to turn the volume up higher on my BlackBerry to get the same level of sound as with other headsets. That is not a problem, just an observation; so if you are used to a certain volume setting with other headsets, you may have to increase it for this headset. If you don't, the music may sound "washed out." There is no volume control on the headset itself, but that is neither unusual nor a problem when using a mobile phone to listen to music.It is very easy to answer calls by using the well placed and unobtrusive button on the cordset.This comes with a nice large case in which the headset easily fits. I prefer this kind of case to the smaller "spool" cases where you have to wrap the headset very carefully to fit it inside.My only nitpicking criticism is I have no idea why Bose chose to use a black and white striped cordset, which does not look particularly stylish and reminds me of stereo wire. But that is not really a big deal for me.Bottom line: If use enjoy listening to music on your mobile phone, and want to easily take calls, this unit is great. For runners it has the added benefit of staying snugly in your ears while running so long as you use the proper size ear insert. I really like these earphones and look forward to using them when I run.Update September 16, 2010: For the past six or seven months I have been listening to music on my Slacker G2 rather than BlackBerry when I run or sit at the beach. But even though I no longer listen to music on a mobile phone, I still love using these headphones. They stay put when I run or sweat, and even when they sometimes become loose, they never fall out, and can be repositioned in a second. So even if you don't listen to music on a mobile phone, these are still great earphones to consider.Update February 5, 2011: I have now been using these for over a year and am still very pleased with their performance.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B002GZ1IRG', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B002GZ1IRG', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00J4TK4CC</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00J4TK4CC</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

Product arrived on time, box was sealed properly, and I did receive the G-900H.My slight annoyance is the convoluted labeling scheme for all of these models. I tried looking around before purchase, and found several sites with model number specifications, but they contradicted one another. I even looked through Samsung documentation, and there were several regional variants for the G-900F, from Europe to Asia, none of which details I was finding listed on Amazon.The G-900H model I received said it was for the Americas, meaning North or South. I registered at an AT&T; store, they changed my number over, SIM card works fine, the phone has been great. Except there's no LTE or 4G features, which I don't mind too much. I'm currently in Mobile, AL, coverage for all carriers seems to be hit or miss depending on where people are, but I am in confirmed 4G/LTE/whatever marketing crap higher-than-3G-newest-thing coverage area. My phone doesn't go above H+ (which is HSPA+ for all you non-technical people out there. Coincidentally, knowing that also means nothing to you, like most of the planet.)So why would Samsung make a product in 2014 without the ability to have 4G capabilities? No idea. Probably the same reason they don't feel like having, or following, basic and simple standard labeling system for people to know what their phone is capable of.In general, the phone is working great. The real test will be in a year, after a couple of updates, to see if it bogs down to a painful pitiful joke like my Note II did. If you want a more detailed review you can simply start to type S5 into Google and be flooded with reviews, specifications, and comparisons.

My Note 3 does not look or feel like I have a protector in it.They include a stick on cover for the Home button because the screen protector is thicker than what we're use to but I found it wasnt needed as the button was easy to find and push.I have a dusty 250 year old house so I went in the bathroom and turned on the hot shower for a few minutes to get some humidity into the air and knock the dust down.  Not too much as you don't want your screen to fog up but enough so you can feel the humidity.Then I was able to install the screen protector without a spec of dust. It took a day for all the "rainbow" effect to disapear but the shield is now invisible.The screen is just as responsive to both touch and stylus as it was before.I'm now going to get one for my wife's phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F4A8FQM" id="B00F4A8FQM-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-04:</strong> better feel than the original glass</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F4A8FQM" id="B00F4A8FQM-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-17:</strong> Awesome screen protectors guys!

I installed the protector per the instructions, even wore rubber gloves to avoid finger prints.

When I pulled the phone out of my pocket, I noticed the edges lifting up. I pressed them out, but it happened again, only now I have a bubble in one of the upper corners that cannot be pressed out. I don't believe the adhesive on this protector is very strong.Also, the raised home button sticker is a little long and will overlap the chrome boarder of the button...also if you lie the phone face down on a table out of case, the sticker is raised enough to activate the button...I image this could happen in a pocket as well(?).Ordering a different brand, hopefully this isn't a common flaw with glass screen protectors.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F4A8FQM" id="B00F4A8FQM-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-19:</strong> I've had my Note 3 Tech Armor glass protector for a couple months now and it was my first ever glass shield.

Amazon seems to be allowing companies to combine the reviews for their various products, which causes confusion and is misleading.  One of the reasons I chose this product is because the 'featured, most-helpful' review stated that it comes with 3 protectors in case you break one during installation.  Luckily, I had no problems installing it on my Samsung Note 3, because it only came with ONE protector, a screen cleansing wipe, cloth and little tool for squeezing out any bubbles.  It turns out the review was for a different screen protector.It works great with my phone - have had no problems with screen sensitivity using my finger or my stylus, so I sent the link directly from my orders page to my son for his Note 3 phone.  He ordered it straight away and his order came as a typical HD plastic (not glass) screen protector in a pack of 3.So far, happy with the product, but be sure to double check which product you are actually ordering and read the reviews carefully.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F4A8FQM" id="B00F4A8FQM-review39" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-19:</strong> I ruined at the first one.

After following the video instructions, as well as the instructions included in the pack, it was impossible to avoid having a few tiny dust particles under the surface, even after using the adhesive strips designed to remove dust/lint. After trying the first two protectors with dust/lint remaining underneath, my third try turned out the best, even if some small dust particles are clearly there underneath. I guess you would need to work in a perfect, sterile vacuum, in order to get the clean application seen in the video. At least my phone's screen is now well protected. I hope you have better luck than I did.Update 3/2/14 ----- Downgraded to one star.I should have just used clear wrapping tape from the beginning and saved time and money.The ONLY good thing about this Protector is the thick gauge.Does not permit the stylus to move smoothly on the screen.It is impossible to get rid of the dust particles beneath protector.I decided to throw away this useless product, and trust that the original  (stronger than gorilla glass) Samsung screen will be enough to withstand scratches, especially with a "wallet case" that protects the phone's screen.

I have to say, that tempered glass is the best idea since sliced bread! Tough. Easy to install. Easy to remove. Bottom line, this is the way to go.Mine arrived fast, and installed in minutes. This is the second one I've used from Tech Armor on this device. The first one, as far as I know, saved my screen from a serious crack. I dropped it pretty badly, and it landed hard on the screen. When I picked it up. my worst fears seemed to be realized when I saw cracks. But upon looking closer, it was only the tempered glass that had cracked, not the screen itself! So I ordered another.

It was really easy to use and easily cleared out any bubbles.  I was really happy about that.  I had these ready to use before I even got the phone.  Not having turned it on and went straight for the screen protector - it was all I knew.  It does an excellent job of keeping finger prints off the screen.  There is a trade off, however, in that to give you the smudge protection and the anti-glare features, it has a matte finish.  I don't use my phone outside much so it doesn't make much sense for me to use this.  The screen has to be angled perfectly for you to get a somewhat clear view of the screen and even at that, there is some distortion on the screen.  Curious, I peeled back and noticed the unfiltered view of the screen - way better - the way the mft intended.  So, I decided to remove it and have enjoyed the phone so much more.  I'll be getting a crystal clear protector instead and returning this one.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F4A8FQM" id="B00F4A8FQM-review65" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-01:</strong> I never installed a screen protector so easily in my life!!

I really cant stand using my finger or pen on bare glass.  It really blurs out and stops reflections well.  The Note 3 pen works just fine with this protector.Con:  A sparkly grainy effect that is hard to describe.  You see this mostly with white screens like using a web browser and it seems to be common in all anti-glare screens.  This causes a slight loss of detail, and a sort of color shimmering as you move the device slightly, even tiny movements make this happen.  I believe they use very tiny grains of sand or something similar to spread out the light, thus reducing glare.  It's a trade off, I can put up with the shimmering, its not that bad.  Putting on any screen protector can be challenging.  Use some clear tape to dab the areas that have tiny specks of dust.  The bubbles without dust are no problem, they can be pushed to the edge easy.  You can peel back the protector and keep doing this till you get the dust out.  ignore the regular bubbles till the end, then just push those out.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F4A8FQM" id="B00F4A8FQM-review68" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-05:</strong> No glare.

When i got it and compared it to the Seidio Vitreo tempered glass screen from my note 2, it was to my disappointment thinner. It was easy to put on a fit well though. I only gave ot 3 stars because if it says ballistic, I expect it to be best.Update 6/10/14: After my review I was contacted by Tech Armor who backed their product and told me of their warranty. Well about 2 weeks ago I dropped my phone. The case had a ding the phone had a ding and my Tech Armor Ballistic was cracked. I contacted Tech Armor, sent them a picture of it, as instructed, and within a week of sending the picture I received a Brand new Tech Armor Ballistic case. By the way,the screen on my note 3 is pristine. Anyone with installation issues, check their page and warranty. It says they will send you a new one if there is Lint trapped under the screen saver. Also it is more resistant to fingerprints abd easier to clean then a plastic one.

It fits around 98% of the glass area, which is the highest amount of coverage I have seen yet. It lets colors through with no distortion that I can see. In fact, I can barely tell it is there. Due to its high amount of coverage, which I was not expecting, I botched the first attempt at seating a screen protector, but this was good practice for lining up the second attempt. The tape that comes with the protectors to remove dust/lint worked very well and did not leave residue. The instructions that came with the protectors were a bit lengthy, but very thorough in how to apply the product to my phone and do so perfectly. I did not end up needing the online video, but I think it is great that they offer a visual aid.My only complaint, and trust me, I am digging pretty far to find one, is the circular sealing sticker on the exterior of the packaging right over the resealable clasp. It was a pain to get that off without damaging the clasp.TL;DR? This product works very well and has set a new standard for me when looking for screen protectors.

Nevertheless, the first time was the charm, and I got two more screen protectors that came in the package still intact.For the first couple of days the screen protector was accumulating pretty much all the oil that might or might not have been on my fingers.

The first protector (full body) cost $39.00 & within a week, the back (body) protection peeled off. The textured back battery cover doesn't lend itself to any kind of adhesive apparently. The screen protector had several bubbles that just wouldn't go away no matter what I did.Another (brand) screen protector was purchased for $12.00 (not glass) and it too ended up getting dust between the screen & the plastic and more bubbles. Frustration setting in!Then I took a chance on purchasing the Tech Armor Premium Ballistic Glass Screen Protector thru Amazon. The screen protector is the bomb, or should that be bomb-proof.Went on without a hitch. The protector literally glided onto the screen like magic. Whatever chemicals or adhesives being used is great stuff.

I think they are a necessary evil for devices that will be used outdoors like phones with touchscreens and GPS's.  Thankfully you are provided with 3 sheets of the plastic film and some high quality adhesive sheets to pick up the tiny specs of lint that will stick to your freshly cleaned screen.  I threw away the first sheet after peeling it off when trying to remove its top protective layer after installing it on my phone.  The second time around, I got the sheet installed and the protective layer removed while keeping the sheet in place.  The installation wasn't perfect, however.  There were a couple tiny specks of lint that got between the screen and the sheet, but they are at the bottom edge and not worth messing with.If you're as anal as I am, you will have some trouble trying to put this on your phone centered and square.  I could not get the cutout for the phone's home button centered vertically but if you could do that, the sheet would fit perfectly. The top cutout for the earpiece, camera and sensors will not interfere with their functions.  The plastic seems to be tough and hasn't been scratched yet and is easy to clean without delaminating.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F4A8FQM" id="B00F4A8FQM-review79" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-17:</strong> What can I say.

After only a couple days of use this screen size was my new normal. I can't imagine using a phone with a smaller screen. My last phone was the iPhone 4S which was great but I have outgrown the screen size.This phone has the largest screen out there and yet still matches and/or beats the quality of all the smaller ones. It is not stretched or pixelated, not ever.I almost never use the handwriting apps yet I use the S pen often. My favorite way to "type" is to use the S pen with the Swype keyboard for Android.At that point I don't think the Android App Market(s) will ever match the apple App Store but there is still a great selection with a quality about for all your needs and desires.Surfing the wed on my note is far more like using a normal laptop/computer than a typical mobile phone experience.The camera I am going to mostly hold out of this review because the shutter speed is slower than any out there so I feel like I must be doing something wrong. However I have not taken the time to tinker around in settings and see if there is something I can adjust to fix this.I highly recommend this phone. Of course those who don't want such a sizable phone should look elsewhere. Those who see it as a great asset this is the phone to get.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0077DEZ4U" id="B0077DEZ4U-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-18:</strong> I purchased the Samsung Note a week ago and all i can say is WOW!This is truly the closest thing to a handheld pc i have ever used,only this is much better than any netbook i have owned in the past.The dual core processor running at 1.5Ghz makes this one of the most powerful devices on the market today,not only that but the 1GB of ram,16GB of internal storage and powerful gpu are also what make this phone a must have for a person on the go.Every single app i throw at it starts up instantly,runs smoothly and i have yet to see any programs force close.This is hands down the best mobile device i have ever used and here is whyThe screenThe 5.3 inch HD Super Amoled display is bright,colorful and just plain beautiful.Its high resolution allows for a ton of content to be displayed at once.When browsing the web you get a desktop view of sites instead of a cramped mobile view like on other devices such as the Galaxy S II or even the Galaxy S II Skyrocket.Call QualityI have a strong AT&T; signal in my area so the calls sound crystal clear both with the earpiece and the speaker.When i go out of town and sometimes get 1 or 2 bars of reception the calls still sound good.No dropped calls.Data SpeedI do not live in an LTE area,i only have hspa+.The data speeds i have been getting are between 3 to 7 mbps download and 700kbps to 1.2mbps upload.Youtube videos play smoothly in high quality mode and most web pages load up in a couple seconds.S-PenI have only used it once or twice so far but it is very responsive and i do think using this could replace a piece of paper for jotting down notes.The other thing that makes this useful is the ability to accurately draw and paint on the Notes screen with it,very nice feature for artists on the go.Rear SpeakerIt works well in that you don't have to lean in to hear things but i do wish it was louder overall.When you have it at max volume there is some distortion but not too bad.GPSSamsung got it right!The Vibrant and Captivate that i owned before both had trouble locking on to my location,it would take over 5 minutes to find me and half the time it would show me a mile away from where i really was.The Infuse i bought later did not have as much trouble getting a lock but it just wasn't consistant with accuracy.I am happy to say that the gps on the Note finds my location within a matter of seconds and is accurate to within 9 feet.It has no issues finding satellites.Build QualityThis has a more of a premium feel to it than other Samsung phones i have used such as the Vibrant which felt very cheap due to the plastic it's made out of.Because of its light weight and slim profile this thing probably would not fair too well after being dropped from waist high.Get a TPU case so the phone has some protection,they are easy to apply and do a great job of keeping the device's body free of scuffs.Data StorageThere is 16GB built in and you can also use a micro sd card in it.I am currently using a Komputerbay 32GB class 10 card and it works perfectly.Operating SystemAndroid Gingerbread is the OS on the phone,it has a much cleaner look to it but other than that i don't see much of a difference between this and Froyo.If you're new to Android or have used it before you will like this OS.Back CameraThe 8mp camera does an outstanding job of taking pictures (3264x2448).They look colorful and sharp.Even in low light the camera does a good job,not as much noise as was the case with older Samsung phones.When taking in door shots the flash comes in very handy and does its job well.My only gripe with the camera is the HD video recording.When recording in 1080p you will notice that the camera is zoomed in just a little bit,there is no way to unzoom.When you go back to recording 720p or lower resolutions everything looks like it should,not zoomed in at all.It's not that the 1080p looks bad ,it looks quite nice and most people might not even care about the slightly zoomed in effect,but i do hope this is fixable with an update.Front CameraThe 2mp front camera takes nice self shots and records video that looks smooth & clear,no dropped frames from what i have seen so far.I used it to video chat over Skype with my family and was pleased with the video quality,they were using a T-Mobile Galaxy S II which has a similar camera.MicrophonesThere are 2 of them and they both work well.When making phone calls the other person said my voice was loud & clear.When recording videos my voice was picked up even when i was 4 feet away and recording with the back camera.On Screen KeyboardAs stated before i have used the Samsung Vibrant,Captivate and Infuse,i never had an issue with typing on the screen and so is the case with the Note.The on screen keyboard is a pleasure to use due to the responsiveness of the capacitive touch screen and how large the keys are since the screen itself is so big.Entertainment And WorkI have only put 720p movies on it so far and the built in media player handled them like a champ,no skipped frames or other issues.As for gaming all i can say is ONLIVE!Download the app from Android market and enjoy full pc or console games on your phone.Connect the device to an HDTV using the MHL adapter and you will be as amazed as i was the first time i tried it out,seeing everything mirrored perfectly and run smoothly on a large display.If you are doing work such as creating or editing documents the ability to connect to an HDTV or Monitor really does make this a hand held office pc.Battery LifeI fully charged the battery and then started using the phone.After making some calls which lasted 90 minutes,sending and receiving 20 text messages,using WiFi to browse the internet,check email,use Yahoo Messenger and also download apps from Android Market for 40 minutes total,Playing Need For Speed Shift for 15 minutes,using the gps and AT&T;'s data network for 35 minutes and taking 33 pictures using the back camera & flash,the battery was still half full by the end of the day.Turning off WiFi when not using it really helps you get the most out of your battery.Included AccessoriesIt comes with standard stuff such as a usb cable and wall charger.AT&T; NetworkFirst of all i have to say that i purchased the Note at full price because i will NEVER sign another cell phone contract again,i am done with them.What i do now is i go prepaid.I just activated an AT&T; sim card through their website and chose the gophone plan.When the site asked me to enter the phones IMEI number i just used the one on my cheap AT&T; gophone i had for years.After the sim was activated & loaded up with prepaid minutes and data i popped it in the Note....everything works!Phone calls and text messaging worked right away but to get data going i just entered the AT&T; apn info i found online,after doing that and restarting the phone data and mms worked perfectly as well.Other than the 1080p video recording zoom issue i can't really say anything bad about this device.I no longer carry around my netbook on trips since this can do everything that machine did plus much more.I don't think i will be upgrading for a while,i am very happy with this phone and i think you will be too :)UPDATE (4-11-2012)I recently noticed that my Note had white blotches and dead pixels on the screen,the blotches were most noticeable when there was a grey background.This is very annoying,it really upsets me because i paid full price for this phone (Over $600).All together i bought 3 Notes,one for myself and 2 for family members.I told them about the defects on my screen so they decided to use a dead pixel finder program to check theirs,guess what THEIRS HAD DEAD PIXELS AND BLOTCHES ALSO!These were all brand new in box AT&T; models,I717.Needless to say i am getting a refund for all the defective Notes i purchased,2 of which were bought from places other than the Amazon Wireless site.If you have this device make sure to use a dead pixel finder program to check if your screen has defects.I really loved the phone but after this i will not be getting another one,3 strikes against it.Back to the Samsung Skyrocket until i can get the Galaxy S III.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container"

My AT&T; contract was ready for an upgrade, so I stopped in the local store to check out the Note. After making sure that I could deal with Android and Touchwiz, the final deciding moment was putting the phone in my pocket. I felt like I was trying on a pair of shoes, and had to walk around... sit, stand etc. It turns out... it was not to big for me... so i got one.After living with it for about 3 weeks, I can safely say it is a great device. The display is great, the s-pen is cool for doodling or taking notes at meetings (I actually do this). What follows is my opinion on this phones pros and cons... remember, it's just an opinion.Cons--------If you are used to iTunes, you have to come up with and get used to a new strategy for syncing this device. There are options... so you have to do some research.The battery is big enough to get me through a day without charging, but considering the size of the battery I was slightly disappointed.AT&T; Bloatware is annoying and can't be completely uninstalled without rooting the phone. Amazingly they didn't install their Visual Voicemail app which is actually useful. It can be installed... XDA Forums have the info.You need to have a sense of humor to deal with people telling you your phone is too big.Pros---------You can add a 32gb sdhc card for around $25... 64gb for $80 if you look hard.It's a great device for reading and browsing the web on. After installing the official Adobe Reader app, I can open pdf's that would choke my iPad.I've had a Google account for a while. The integration with docs, gmail and everything else is very nice.I really like the rear camera. It takes very nice snapshots with good detail. I own quite a few digital cameras, and I was pretty impressed.Summary---------If you are interested in this phone, but scared of it's humongous reputation... try it first before dismissing it. There are a lot of reviews on the web telling you that its too big to be a phone... check it out and make up your own mind. If you want a phone just to make phone calls and check your email, this is probably not the phone for you. If you like to watch movies, read, play games and take photos you should check it out.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0077DEZ4U" id="B0077DEZ4U-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-05-01:</strong> When people see my phone, they get jealous. this phone is big but it is still portable.It is beautiful.It has excellent 4g service, at least that I get in So Cal.People  get jealous and try to compare  their tablet to this phone, a tablet is not a phone.  And this phone is not a tablet, but rather portable device that has tablet/phone capabilities.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0077DEZ4U" id="B0077DEZ4U-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-02-21:</strong> I have not been this excited about a cell phone since waiting for the original iPhone one to come out.  Yes, I am a early adapter.I love the huge screen.  Yes it is big and to some that is a draw back, but I use my phone a lot, but rarely to make phone calls.  I am going to school and like to place my PDFs, books, Tabers medical dictionary and other school books on the phone.  It really beats having to carry them around, or carrying a separate phone and tablet.  I am a little older and my vision is not sharp as it used to be, but the screen is really clear and easy to see.  The phone will fit in my dress shirt pocket and any pants or shorts front pockets that I wear.As for the "wow!" factor.  If you remember, I said that I was attending school.  The younger students thought the phone was huge and the females thought it was to big for them to carry.  But when they saw the PDF notes and the information for the classes I was able to keep on the phone, there still wasn't a "wow" factor or even an "I am impressed" moment, but maybe they understood a bit more.  But I did not buy the phone to impress a bunch of young 20 something ladies.  So, minus one star for the pretty ladies being unimpressed. LOLI use the phone a lot for the GPS function.  The GPS is very fast to pick up the satellites and find my position.  Since the screen is so large, I can easily see where I am going.  The screen has wonderful sharpness and contrast.  I will not comment of the color quality since I cannot see colors.Processor speed:  I did a bench mark test on the CPU, and CPU coupled with the GPU is fast.  Bench marks do not mean to much because they are just numbers, but the dual core processor is pretty quick once in the application and out of the touch whiz interface.The Samsung interface is a real let down, especially with the included bloatware provided by our friends at ATT.  If you are willing to root your phone, you will pick up speed in the main screens and apps screens.  I had mine for less than an hour and rooted the phone.  I have also modded the lock screen, it is not hard to do.  With that mod I can get to my text messages, camera, main menu or adjust the ringer settings with a swipe of the finger instead of having to get to the home screen and then choose what I want to do.  But regardless of rather you root your phone; from time you press on the app from the time it launches is fast.  My last phone was the infuse, which is very slow and the GPS is even painfully slower.Stylus:  I have play4ed with the stylus a bit and i really cannot see a real use for it except maybe jotting down a short note.  I am not going to use the stylus to scroll through screens and pick apps to launch.  I makes a nice easy way to write "I love you" to your wife during church.  Other than that it is not very useful to me.Battery:  The battery is more difficult to get to then the other phone that I have owned, save the iPhone.  Plus, getting the battery cover back on is even harder.  I have been playing with my new phone like a child would play with a new toy, so the battery does not seem to last long, but longer than the Infuse or the Skyrocket II.  I really wish Samsung would have used the extra real estate, due to the [hones size, to put a little beefier battery.Conclusion:  I really do like the phone.  More icons per screen and larger items are easier to see.  I spend a lot of time on my phone with internet, apps and texting so ease of use is a huge bonus.  I no longer need to carry around a separate tablet or laptop, I have all the information in one place.  With the few customizations that I have done, the phone is fast and user friendly.  The phone is wide and the need for big hands is a must. The stylus for me is a big looser.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0077DEZ4U" id="B0077DEZ4U-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-09-15:</strong> ok i love this phone i think it is the best phone that att has came out with it got the ice cream sandwich and jelly bean too love the size of the phone love the color of it i love love the keyboard on it love the cases for it love the fact that it can take a 64g sd card love the feel of the back of the phone most people dont like the screen size but i love it i have a tab so i like the fact that it like a tab but not the size of one love the s pen and the note and drawing that can be fun well my kids have fun with it i have both of the so sorry if it sound the same when you read the one for the white one i love the fact that it rings lough too kindle shows great on here love the pdf viewer</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0077DEZ4U" id="B0077DEZ4U-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-12:</strong> i'm going to be short with my review, just going to list the things I didn't like about the phone.1. There was a bug where the phone's screen would show a LOT of pixelation when it's viewing something very dark. Basically you'll see black and dark gray squares everywhere. It should be a software issue, but it annoyed me a lot.2. price, i just couldn't justify owning a $600 phone.3. the s-pen is really useless unless you play draw something a lot.4. when holding the phone for long periods of time (youtube videos), my hands get really tired if you grip it with one hand. for me, i like whipping my phone out at times with one hand to check some stuff out quickly, this phone is NOT meant to do that. ideally it must be held with both hands, which really limits multitasking.5. there is a very noticeable shutter lag in its camera.6. slow update to ICS, still not out as far as I know.7. plastic design, don't know why samsung loves plastic that much.i'm not hating on the phone, I think it's a great phone, but just not for me.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B0077DEZ4U', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B0077DEZ4U', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B007ZGTY86</h2>    <p class="price"> $B007ZGTY86</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

It went on easier than most covers. It fits my T-Mobile T989 perfectly. The matte finish looks nice on the phone, when it's turned off. The feel is nice, doesn't stick and doesn't interfere with the sensitivity of the screen. But I won't be keeping it. When the phone is on it looks like there is a black window screen over the display. I guess it's a trade-off for anti-glare, but I can't tolerate it. If you are willing to trade off display quality for the other things that are right, then this is for you. Too bad it's not for me.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007ZGTY86" id="B007ZGTY86-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-08:</strong> Bought them and they fit just right. no fingerprints left and the anti glare in right. will definitely buy again, fast shipping and great service.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007ZGTY86" id="B007ZGTY86-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-12:</strong> it's never been scratched up before and its grate if you care about your phone  like i do so i recommend it</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007ZGTY86" id="B007ZGTY86-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-19:</strong> I loved this product ,fits great on the galaxy 2 .

He just applied this protector last night and complained that it distorted the screen. "what's the point of having the hi def screen if the protector distorts it?" direct quote.

A screen protector is a good idea, but maybe not this one.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009GLS970" id="B009GLS970-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-03:</strong> I think the only reason why I bought this is because it's very cheap for a pack of 3.  I would not buy it again.  There are a couple good things about it but many things bad that I don't like about it.PROS:Easy to apply.Matte is nice on the touch.CONS:Degrades display quality (everything was sharp and vibrant before applying the protector).Leaves a large margin around the edges/corners of the device (I had to go buy a case that had a lip to go around my phone to cover what the protector does not, even then I still have 1mm of unprotected surface).The second con, it may not be an issue for some people but it is for me.  Coming from an iPhone, all screen protectors I have ever had with iPhones either covers the entire front display (not just the "screen" portion) or covers nearly all of the front face.  I expected that with my GN2 but I see there are other brands that also do it this way so I'll be sure to be more careful shopping for protectors.The biggest thing I just can't stand is how it gives my display a grainy look and makes my phone look very unsharp.  It isn't exactly iPhone retina quality (which I give props to Apple for) but it certainly shouldn't look like this the way the protector makes it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009GLS970" id="B009GLS970-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-03:</strong> I received it faster than expected date which is always awesome.It's the typical screen protector.-It has a cleaning cloth so you can clean your screen before installing the screen protector.-You peel one side off, place it on your phone and use the hard plastic card to remove the bubbles.-Then peel off the second side and you're done.-It's exactly shaped as the photo.

Combining with a case makes the prtection work well.  It comes with everything you need.  One tip I would sugges is after cleaning the screen off use scotch tape to pick up any debis before applying this.  You will get a nice clean seal, better than just wiping clean with the supplied cloth.

Hers had to be sized and cut to fit.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009GLS970" id="B009GLS970-review30" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-01:</strong> I have to admit I was skeptical about these.

It LOOKS a little bigger than the stock HTC battery and was a snug fit, but the back cover fits on securely with no problems, and the battery is not difficult to remove.  I have seen mention on XDA-developers that these batteries have no temperature sensor, but according to Battery Monitor Widget, it's got a perfectly functional temperature sensor... and it's actually got a capacity LARGER than the expected 1600 mAh.If it's still this good in six months, I'll upgrade this review to five stars.Six month update: The battery is still great! 5 stars!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005KPF59Q" id="B005KPF59Q-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-09:</strong> Great battery, delivered promptly.

I accepted and received a brand new battery 2 days later. This new battery seems to work better, even though I've moved on to a difference phone I still use the G2 phone to keep kids entertained with the mindless apps on android on wi-fi. Standby life is ridiculously good with the new battery.So +2 stars for the great customer service. Appears quality control for the batteries has increased over the course of one year. Plus it seems like Anker is becoming more legitimate, the first battery I bought had a shoddy looking package for the battery, this new replacement has a more professional and legit looking package.*********************EDIT 1 - 3 months after purchaseWell that certainly went south quick. Battery is as bad, if not worse, than the 19 month old battery it replaced. Discharges quite quickly. At least I have interchangeable bad batteries to last me a day of several texts, calls and web browsing over 4G and wifi.****************Original Review-I bought this battery for a HTC G2 phone (tmobile), the original battery was discharging quite rapidly after 19 months of use. This battery has a bit larger capacity than the OEM one (1600 mAh vs 1300) so it should last longer than an OEM one when new, but I don't think that's the case. At the end of the day I am left with about 40-50% charge on the battery so I still have to charge it at night, I expected 2 days use with the larger capacity. However I may be at fault here because I recently replaced the LCD on the phone and I believe I might've screwed up the light sensor on the phone because anytime I firmly grasp or move the phone while it is use the screen brightness always jumps up to 100 brightness, even in a dark room; therefore I believe this long term use of max brightness is a detriment to the battery life. Oh well, the phone will be replaced in 5 months.I don't like that the battery gets quite hot, after watching a 10 min youtube video, the phone is very hot, even the metal around the screen is very hot. Once again, this might be my fault from when I  replaced the LCD screen.I like Anker batteries, I have replaced several Samsung and HTC batteries with Ankers, they're inexpensive and perform great with no issues.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005KPF59Q" id="B005KPF59Q-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-25:</strong> Not much to say about this battery except it works.

I really liked the way the look seemed to compliment the iPhone with the black border and clear back on my white (Stupid company) iPhone so I went ahead and ordered it.I'll be honest, my expectations were low and I thought I'd get some cheap case that would hold up for a few weeks before starting to discolor or deform.NOPE!I'm extremely impressed with the overall build quality and feel of this case, it punches way above it's price point.The materials feel very high grade and have not shown any signs of discoloration since I've started using it.  Impact protection, which is something they mention on this design, seems good as neither the case nor my phone have taken damage from couple of 'Out of Pocket Experiences' that occurred with the case.All ports and buttons are easily accessible, button coverings for power and volume buttons are firm but perfectly functional while all ports on the bottom fit even my equipment mounts.Overall, this is a great low cost case that you won't feel that you skimped on while using it.I would consider this as a case for a personal phone, that is how impressed I am with the build quality and overall feel of the case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EP507EA" id="B00EP507EA-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-19:</strong> At first when I was putting the case I was thinking of the really bad reviews how it was scratching up the phone, there were already marks on it and stuff... thats exactly what happened ...

It has protected my phone for more than a few drops, including one from about 4ft to concrete. It's raised enough on the front to protect the screen if it lays or lands face down, and feels very comfortable in hand. The bad part is, dust/ dirt/ whatever gets under the back clear plastic and the phone rubbing against the plastic scratches up the back of the phone quite a bit. Maybe it'll help to put a picture in the back, but the point of the 5C is the color.

I also have easy access to the silence button just above the volume controlsThe phone w/case fits in my back and front jeans pockets, which is important to me.I've dropped it twice, once on carpet and once on hardwood floor. It survived, but I don't know if the case had anything to do with it or not. The falls weren't from much height, and the landings were pretty soft.The rubber bumper provides a 2 or 3mm step that should protect the screen if the phone lands face down. Unfortunately, this is one of those things that you don't know until it happens. I have a ZAGG screen protector on it, which helps protect the screen from scratches, etc., but probably not falls.The screen protector that came with the phone didn't seem adequate to me, but others might find it to be perfectly suitable.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EP507EA" id="B00EP507EA-review39" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-14:</strong> I bought this to replace a Luvvitt mistake I made earlier.  This case is perfect!  It does not add much bulk to the phone and feels like it will offer very good drop protection.  The buttons function easily & accurately.  Many complaints I read before I purchased reference the clear back not being clear enough.  Once I pulled the masking off both the inside & outside, the back was crystal clear.  The masking had no visible edge to pull.  I had to pick & scrape at the corner to get it off.  I would guess that complaints regarding the back were due to the masking not being removed.  Time will tell how well the back stays scratch free.  Honestly, it is not that important to me.

Top reviewers are often asked to review new battery packs and one of the benefits of being asked to test different power banks is that it gives me an opportunity to compare them to each other using the same charging test, so I can compare them using "apples to apples" comparison. This set of tests allows me to provide unbiased results as the numbers speak for the performance of each unit.My methodology is to charge each mobile device on each port of the unit for 10 minutes and measuring how much each unit was charge in that 10 minute period. In addition I tested charging two mobile devices at the same time. Each line in the table below represents a separate 10 minute test.I use Battery App by Elvison to determine how each device recognized the charging source. 'AC' status means the charging is at full charging rate. 'USB' status indicates charging at a lower charging rate. 'Discharging' status means that the charging rate is below the power that the device is consuming so it slows down the discharge rate but does not re-charge.&#10152; General features:======================The external battery comes with a charging cable and 6 tips - including micro USB, mini USB and iPad.  It did not have tips for Samsung Galaxy Tab or lightening connector for iPad Mini and I used my own charging cables during the tests.  The power bank has a built-in flash light. It is not super bright, but could be handy during a power outage. The package also includes a one port wall charger, whose performance I also measured and include the results of the tests below.Timetec Xamp 5600mah External Battery weighs 4.5 oz. Its size is 3.75" x 1.75" x 0.875". The pack has one USB output port.  It comes with a pouch which fits the power pack,  cable and tips.Timetec wall charger weighs 1 oz. Its size is 2" x 0.75" x 1.25". The charger has one USB output port.  I like the shape of the charger it is tall and narrow and takes up only one slot on the outlet extention strip.I am attaching a photo of Timetec Xamp 5600mah during one of the test next to my tablet for size reference. You can find this photo by following 'customer photos' link under the main photo in this listing.&#10152; Test Results:======================&#10004; Samsung Galaxy 7.7 tablet (using my own Galaxy tab connector cable)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Power Pack: AC ~~~~~~ 2% change in charge in 10 minutesWall Charger: AC ~~~~ 2% change in charge in 10 minutes&#10004; iPad Mini tablet (using my own lightening connector cable)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Power Pack: AC ~~~~~~ 2% change in charge in 10 minutesWall Charger: AC ~~~~ 2% change in charge in 10 minutes&#10152; Key finding:======================&#10004; This power pack works equally well with Samsung Galaxy tablet and iPad Mini.  It is not the fastest power pack I have tested, but its small size makes it a good power pack to have on the go.Ali Julia review</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008TY621A" id="B008TY621A-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-30:</strong> This product is very well thought-out and good bang for your buck because it not only includes the battery, but a standalone USB charger (about $5-10 if purchased separately) and a drawstring pouch as well. I own 2 other power banks and this is the only one that comes with a charger and bag. I'm not a big fan of the material used for the pouch (looks and feels like a shower sponge), but it's padded and useful for keeping all the cables and plugs in one place for throwing inside a suitcase. About the size of an old school cellphone, the battery itself is small and portable. Construction is solid, with a shiny piano black finish and blue LED circles that light up telling you the amount of charge left.It holds 5600 mAh, enough for a little under 4 full charges on the iPhone 4S and 5 (capacity 1430 mAh and 1440 mAh, respectively). The iPad 3 is about 11,600mAh, so this will give you about a 1/3 of a charge. In practice, I've never used a power bank on my iPad. I charge it up before I go and it usually lasts me the entire trip, or there's an outlet nearby at a hotel or airport. It's always my iPhone that runs out of juice when I need it most.Included in the package is:1 battery1 USB wall charger1 short USB cable for Xamp to device (7")1 longer USB cable for wall charger to device (27")5 interchangeable heads for various phones and devices (mini-USB, micro-USB, Apple connector, and 2 others for various older phones)1 soft pouchMost devices are mini or micro USB these days, so you'll really only need those. Charging speed is 1000 mAh/hr so a full charge to an iPhone 4S/5 will be about a little over an hour and a half. It takes 5-6 hrs to charge the Xamp itself, so just leave it overnight. I've tested the unit and the USB charger on an Android phone, iPad, iPhone, Kindle Keyboard and everything worked as expected. Bonus points for having a detailed and thorough user's manual booklet that explains all the features and usage, along with diagrams. One unexpected feature is the flashlight! I was wondering what the big LED on top was. Double-clicking the power button turns the light on and off. It's not very bright in comparison to the iPhone flashlight, but it's there for when you need it! Double-clicking is a lot faster than swiping my phone, entering my unlock password, scrolling to the flashlight app, tapping it, then tapping on the power button on my app.For the price ($30 at the time of writing), this is a very good and practical buy for yourself or as a gift for the frequent traveller. 1 year warranty.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008TY621A" id="B008TY621A-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-20:</strong> This small juice pack really comes in handy when you are on the road and you are running out of charge. I use it primarily with my iPad 2nd Generation and it works perfectly.First of all this small juice pack can be charged one of two ways. Either by plugging it in the wall with the provided adapter or by charging it with the included USB cord. According to the instructions it says it will take longer to charge via USB cord due to the lower voltage but I have charged it both ways and it typically takes about 4 hours either way I charge it.If you use an iPad a lot like I do you might find yourself on the road with an empty charge. With this juice pack you simply plug the usb cord into the juice pack, attach the 30 pin connector to the other end and plug it in to your iPad. It has the power to keep you going for many hours. It doesn't hold enough power to fully charge my iPad but it will charge it about 3/4 of the way. That is really plenty of power to serve its purpose.The juice pack itself is roughly 3 1/2 inches long by 1 inch by 1 1/2 inch. It has some weight to it and seems to be made solid. It has blue flashing LED lights that tell you when it's charging and how full the battery is. It comes with a variety of attachments including the standard 30 pin adapter for most Apple products. Keep in mind that if you have the newest iPad Retina it doesn't include an adapter for it. I am not sure if you could purchase one or not. It includes adapters to charge a limited number of cellular phones. Refer to the Amazon page for a complete listing of compatible phones. It also comes with a nice soft mesh travel bag to carry everything in. My only complaint is that when you are trying to use it while it's plugged in it's a little awkward. It sticks straight out at the bottom a couple inches and usually gets in the way. It's not too big of a deal but it bugs me at times.Overall I think this is a good juice pack for the price which is currently very reasonable. There are many different choices when it comes to juice packs but I think it will be difficult to find a better juice pack for the price.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008TY621A" id="B008TY621A-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-28:</strong> The Timetc Xamp 5600mah is a solid power bank, giving the user a small form power bank, lots of recharging capability (5600mah), and reliability.Features- 5600mah capacity- Recharges va mini USB- Built in flashlight (very useful)The Xamp has a nice sleek design, clean finish (glossy), and the buttons have a good soft & responsive feel.

It also contains an LED light for spotlighting a small area. The Xamp comes with a cloth carrying case, 7" and 27" USB cables to the proprietary Xamp connector the DC3.5v, a USB AC wall plug, as well as connectors for mini USB, micro USB, Nokia dc2.0, iPod and iPad and one other adapter I have yet to determine what it will connect with. The box suggests "Please use your own charging cable for Apple Products."  This is somewhat misleading since the Xamp comes with 2 adapters for the common Apple products. Theoretically a USB charger can be used to boost the battery for most similar handheld devices and gadgets.The power button requires a double press to toggle the LED on/off.Per the very elegant packaging, the Xamp is fully charged in 6 to 8 hours via 5vDC 1amp input and claims to be rechargeable 500 or more times. The charger claims a robust 1000 mah/hour output to devices to satisfy even the most hard-core device needs. The packaging indicates 3 connectors are included - the USB mini, micro and dc2.0, however there are three other adapters included as well (a bonus of sorts).The manual states the LED lights indicates the power remaining:one LED indicates less than 25% remainingtwo LEDs indicates 25-50% power remainsthree LEDs indicate 50-75% power remainsfour LEDs indicate 75-100% power remainsSuggestion to Manufacturer:  I wish the Xamp 5600 mah was slimmer and included a built-in mini USB power adapter such asMotorola Universal Dual-Charging Portable Power Pack - Black - Retail Packaging.  However the Xamp is 5600 mah whereas the Motorola is only 1500 mah.Rating:  4.5 stars. The lack of a built-in microUSB cable, the proprietary DC3.5v connectors should be changed to microUSB connectors and more consistent information between the packaging to the user manual would make the Xamp a full 5 star product.Full-Disclosure:  The manufacturer provided this item for reviewing purposes.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008TY621A" id="B008TY621A-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-24:</strong> Disclaimer: I received this product free for the purpose of an honest test run and review.Okay, so I'm not going to touch the technical aspects of this device. The other reviewers have done an admirable job of doing so. I will simply speak of my experience and my thoughts regarding this power bank.Simply put, I thought it was pretty exceptional. I dont have a lot of experience with these devices, but I have found it to be quite useful so far. It was able to fully charge my dead droid battery in about two and a half hours, and still had all four circles left (the circles, which you can see in the pic, show the charge left in the power bank). I then used it to charge my girlfriends droid and our kindle Fires. All told, that drained a little more than half of the power bank, although the Fires both had about a 50% charge when I plugged them in. It mentions PSP's in the description. I dont own one, but I do own a pair of Vita's. This device did not work with the Vita's even though I was able to plug them into this. I left the light on overnight after all that, and after about 15 hours of basically continual use, it still had one circle left. I plugged it in and it took about 10 hours to recharge the power bank (using the included wall plug).As far as aesthetics, this is a very nice looking device, small enough to fit in your pocket (although it does come with a mesh carry pouch), comes with a small assortment of charging attachments designed to fit a variety of phones and devices.The flashlight also works well. It isnt strong enough to illuminate a room or even a decent path if you are walking in the dark (although it will light up the area immediately in front of you). It is however more than adequate for rummaging through boxes, trunks, etc...and I have found it particularly useful in looking for stuff in my bedroom after my girlfriend has gone to sleep.So, I am quite pleased with this device. I think it works great and is a welcome and useful addition to my array of random gadgets and devices.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008TY621A" id="B008TY621A-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-24:</strong> I have a bunch of portable powerpacks. Several, like this one, were provided at no charge for my review. This is the most bang for the back as far as size and power. It's 5600 mAh - that's enough to charge the average smart phone two or three times. This is small enough to keep in a purse or pocket while charging or powering your device. I can't count the times I've forgotten to charge my Droid, grabbed it, left the house - and no phone. Charging in the car is a pain - if I'm out on errands, the car is running 10 minutes, parked, etc. With the battery pack, I can keep the phone "plugged in" and charging the entire time.  I use it to charge my iPod and Droid. Especially handy on long trips where I won't have access to chargers.It weighs 4.5 ounces (heavier than most phones) and includes several adapters. Other packs include a wider variety of connectors, but this has the most common. Micro USB, mini-USB, iDevice and several other power connectors.

I often run my iPad and iPhone in a mode that leaves me looking for a power outlet after about a day, and I'm always interested in ways I can extend the battery life.  I must say I'm very pleased with the TimeTec battery.  It's a well-designed unit with plenty of adapters, and it has enough juice to do the job.First off, I plugged my iPhone 4 into the unit at about 75%.  In about 30 minutes, I was back to 100% and the charger was still showing four power indicators (100%).  I then plugged in my iPad (1st gen), expecting that to just hover around the 80% mark that it was at.  Wrong... It charged up just as fast, and left the charger showing 75% remaining.  Realistically, it was probably down to about 50% but just hadn't tripped the second indicator yet.  I plugged it back in to recharge, and it was back to full power in a little over an hour.  I was using the AC plug for recharging the battery, but you can also recharge via USB.  Since my car is USB-equipped, that means I can use this on the fly.The unit is very light, so it's not a hassle to lug around.  It comes with a large number of plug adapters (Nokia DC2.0, micro USB, mini USB, and standard iPhone), so it's quite versitile. It even has a small flashlight built in if you happen to be using it in some dark area and need a little extra light.  Coupled with the mesh pouch that stores everything, this makes for a convenient addition to your travel bag.This is definitely an option to consider if you're looking for an additional power source to extend your electronic device battery life on long trips or at times you're not around a power plug.Disclosure:Obtained From: CompanyPayment: Free</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008TY621A" id="B008TY621A-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-19:</strong> I was approached by TimeTec Inc. to try out their new product and provide a review.  So I did receive this product as a gift from TimeTec.The product is exactly as described on Amazon.  It is small and compact and provides a great way to charge my iPhone and iPad when I am not near a power source, or while traveling without having to take along several cables.  I can take this product with just one cable and two different small adapters that were all provided and fit easily into the provided carrying case.After opening the product it took just an hour to get it fully charged up.  As advertised it has a small flashlight app, but I'm not sure how often that will be useful, since the flashlight app on most phones is more convenient.My iPhone was 50% charged when I connected the TimeTec 5600 to it.  It took 64 minuets to bring it back to a full charge.  The TimeTec didn't get overly warm, it was cool to touch during the charging.  It also showed no drop in power bars (it has four circles to signify, 25, 50, 75 & 100% charge.  After an hour charging my phone the TimeTec still showed 100% capacity, I assume that means it used only around 10% of its power to recharge my phone.I then gave a quick charge to my iPad, it was at 75% when I started.  A half hour later it was fully charged.  And still the TimeTec showed full power left, so i would believe that means I used less than 1/4th of its charge to give my two devices a quick boost.The product came with two USB cables with power plug ends, 4 device attachments to fit apple products and android products, along width a wall plug for use with the cables.I would have given a 5 Star rating but I did have one problem.  There is a web site listed on the packaging box but whe I typed it into my browser I'm told the site can not be found.  So I was unable to verify the company.  I tried a Google search and also could not find thei company.The device is made in China and I can only assume that it is part of a much larger corporation.For the price I believe this product will satisfy most travelers that want a quick battery pack back up for their phones and tablets.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B008TY621A', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B008TY621A', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00A55Q2HA</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00A55Q2HA</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

I was satisfied with it, but I always wondered if the other (more expensive) brands were better. When I got my Nexus 4, I decided to flirt with a Cruzerlite Bugdroid in semi-transparent smoke. I liked the cool droid carving design, but I didn't like the feel of the glossy edge. The slightest bit of oil or moisture on my hands would make it slippery and the phone kept wanting to flip in my hands. That's when I knew I should have stuck with Diztronic. While not super grippy, the matte finished edge on the Diztronic provides a consistent feel regardless of how dry or moist my hands are, and it doesn't show any fingerprints. Also, I can say from trying both cases that the sealed buttons on this one are much easier to use than the perfectly aligned button cutout design on the Cruzerlite case.I was tempted to buy the Diztronic in smoke color, too, but read the other reviews here about the branding on the back colliding with the LG logo. So I went with classic black instead. When the case arrived, I was surprised to see the Diztronic had fixed the issue (at least on the black color) and moved their logo down closer to the bottom edge, below the LG logo. I guess I shouldn't have been so surprised since this company has a history of improving it's product based on customer feedback, just like they did with the Galaxy Nexus case when they eventually got it right with "revision 3".So why the missing stars? There is one significant issue with the case I received: the bottom right corner has a very rough "blemish" - see the photo I uploaded. It may be related to the injection molding process, and I don't know if it's just a random anomaly or a recurring manufacturing defect. Others may not notice it, but it's a big deal for me because when I make voice calls, I hold the phone with my left hand and wrap my pinky around that corner to secure it. That blemish is jagged enough to irritate my skin. It's extra annoying because the rest of my fingers feel a nice smooth texture, and then bang - a rough patch that screams out of place.I've considered sanding it down with fine sandpaper, but I'm afraid of making it worse. It's not just excess bits, some of the unevenness seems to be material being too thin at certain spots.Also, Diztronic should update their product pictures to show the location of the new branding.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A55Q2HA" id="B00A55Q2HA-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-18:</strong> She loves it and fits her phone perfectly!

Some of us want protection that is not like an Otterbox, but at the same time more than just a plastic scratch protector.  It appears Diztronic did this right.PROS:1.  High quality workmanship and manufacturing. No rough edges or frayed plastic.2.  Snug fit, but not too tight.3.  No cut outs for the buttons as that loosens the case and allows pocket lint and dust another entry point.  Buttons work fine.4.  The lip on front is very useful for accidental drops or if you should place your phone screen down and it moves.  It protects the screen.5.  The case will protect from small accidental drops and scratches.6.  The cutouts for the camera, speaker, micro USB, headphone jack, and microphones are perfect.  They line up exactly.7.  Minimalistic design that offers protection, but is still slim.CONS:1.  Like other cases of this style, if dirt & debris enter the case from any opening, it may scratch the metal bezel and glass back. It may be a good idea to protect the back with a plastic skin.2.  The back appears to have been fused or molded on, thereby delineating an edge around the back.  This is no problem, but I would have preferred it to be smooth like other Diztronic cases of the past.3.  The Diztronic logo on the back should be one font size smaller.4.  The Nexus 4 tends to heat up on heavy 3G use, this case will prevent you from feeling the heat.  This isn't necessarily a "CON", but important to point out since if you feel heat, then the battery will drain quickly and users should be aware of this.BOTTOM LINE:  This is the best slim case for the Nexus 4.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A55Q2HA" id="B00A55Q2HA-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-10:</strong> Perfect fit for my Nexus 4.

As of right now, case selection for the Nexus 4 is fairly limited (much like the supply of the phone itself I suppose). I tend to like keeping my phones in cases from the first day I own them. To be honest, I purchased this case thinking that it would only be temporary until some of the more well known brands developed cases for the Nexus 4, but I ended up liking this case so much that I think I'll be keeping it on the phone long term.One of the main reasons I picked this case is because I like when cases have a &#34;lip&#34; on the front that sticks out to help protect the screen when laying the phone flat on a surface. This Diztronic case has a nice lip, probably about 1/8th of an inch. It's large enough to ensure adequate screen protection without being overly large to make the phone uncomfortable to press against your ear. Perfect size.Also, I like the material the case is made from. It provides plenty of grip beyond what the stock phone offers (glass on both sides = slippery). It's just the right amount of grip in my opinion. Comfortable to hold without being so grippy that you can't smoothly slide it into or out of a pocket without it getting stuck on the lining of your pocket.I like the color as well, it looks good on the phone. Yes, as others have mentioned, the Diztronic logo on the back partially covers the &#34;LG&#34; logo behind it, which is still visible since the case is translucent. Who cares??? I know what brand my own phone is, and I don't care if other people can see it. I'm not sure why this would bother anyone. You can still see &#34;NEXUS&#34; perfectly fine on the back below the camera...that should be good enough.All cutouts on the case are perfectly sized and line up well with the openings on the phone. The case covers the volume/power buttons, but actually makes them easier to find and press than they are on the stock phone. If it were up to me, I would have made the buttons even slightly larger to make them even easier to press. But as it stands, they've improved over the stock phone, so no issues there.Also, one last note, this case will still allow the phone to work on wireless charging mats without needing to pop the phone out every time you lay it down. Excellent to know for those of you who use a mat on a regular basis.All in all, especially considering the price, I am thrilled with the case. Diztronic even followed up by email after my purchase to make sure I was satisfied. I'll definitely be looking at their products in the future anytime I need a case for a new phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A55Q2HA" id="B00A55Q2HA-review22" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-17:</strong> **12/25/2012 Update**  I got to say that my replacement case is much much better than the initial one I received.  It truly looks and feels seamless now and most of the initial issues I had are fixed.  Looks like I just initially received a bad case.  All the edges are smooth and feel very comfortable, though overall it still feels rather smooth and "slick" but it's not a huge deal.  Clay & Diztronic customer support went above and beyond helping me out with the issue, they were super friendly and super quick to respond.  I got a replacement sent out right away and received it in just a few days.  This just solidifies my choice of sticking with Diztronic now and in the future.  Thanks!I'm a HUGE Diztronic fan.  I have Diztronic cases on all my phones and all my families phones.  They're fantastic and I really wanted to love the hard shell case, but I just couldn't.  The case is super slick and slides out of my hand rather easily.  I dropped my phone for the first time picking it up off the dresser, luckily the drop was only a couple of feet onto carpet.  The corners where the seams meet are rather rough and are irritating to my fingers.  Also there were a few sharp bumps on the inside of the case that left a small imprint on the back of my phone, luckily I have a rear skin on it and it soon worked it self out.  The bumps are invisible to the naked eye, but are very noticeable if you rub your finger over it, I'm sure it's just a minor defect in my particular case.  And I hate to say it, but I'd rather not have cut outs for the volume and power, I'm not sure if it's just the way the phone is designed, but it just feels slightly "harder" to get your finger in there to hit the buttons, most notably on the power button.  I did love how thin the case felt though and it fit perfect with a Skinomi front & rear protector installed. It also felt much better than having the official bumper on, but the flaws were just too irritating to keep the case on.  Maybe a later revision will fix some of the quirks, like it being too smooth and maybe making the cut outs for the volume and power slightly larger.  I'm still a big fan and will keep the case and try it out some more, maybe it will grow on me.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A55Q2HA" id="B00A55Q2HA-review23" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-07:</strong> Nice case.

I like this one too but not as much. Its not as comfortable in my hand as the one for the galaxy nexus was. Part of that is probably just the shape of the phone itself compared to the the other phone, but the galaxy nexus case also had a rounded bulge in the bottom that conformed to the shape of my hand. The buttons and the cutouts are just perfectly placed and it's designed to protect the phone very well. It extends out front over the bezel to protect the glass if it is set on a rough surface. As all phones do mine has taken a couple of falls but you'd never know it by looking at it. There's absolutely no visible damage. The story might be different if it were from a higher starting point but I'm not going to test that.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A55Q2HA" id="B00A55Q2HA-review25" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-06:</strong> Fits phone perfectly.

I have bought and discarded many cases, however, because I've never found one for any phone that I really liked.  With the glass back on the Nexus 4 I knew that I'd better get a case.  Any drop with this phone would probably result in a crack or nasty scratch.  It's just too fragile to leave without a case.  I like this case, because it has built in buttons for power and volume rather than cut outs.  Cut outs make it much harder to press buttons.  This case actually makes it easier to use the buttons.  I haven't found that the case hinders the phone's usability at all.  It is easily pocketable and it provides great protection.  The case doesn't creak like some cases I've tried.  The lip on the front of the phone isn't overly obtrusive, but it is raised enough to give some added grip and protection for the screen when dropped.  I'm glad I went with a case that has the full wrap around lip, rather than the super thin cases that only cover the sides of the phone.  I dropped my phone onto concrete the other day, and I watched it in slow-mo as it bounced off my leg and went tumbling to the ground where it landed face down.  My phone had no damage whatsoever.  The case lip showed a tiny bit of scuffing, but that's what it's there for.  Great case.  I'd highly recommend it to anyone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A55Q2HA" id="B00A55Q2HA-review31" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-14:</strong> This is my favorite.

It makes swiping in from the edges of the screen a bit difficult.The other issue is that after a month or so of use the matte texture on the back of the case begins to develop a but of a worn look to is.

In the other one, there was no noticeable difference, in this one, I have to make a conscious effort to push harder to wake the phone. Secondly, the cutout for the usb cable is too small and the cable I use for my car charger will not go all the way in. This is the same cable I used on the same case on my other phone. I could get a new charger, but why do I have to, and what other cable that I might need will not fit as well. I don't know if I got a lemon or not, as everyone seems to love this case.

Especially when I buy a phone case for my baby. Lol. I always get cases whenever I get a new phone to protect my investment.This case offers a smooth texture, it clasps on tightly to the phone and it's edges. Just be careful if you have on a screen protector, the case will peel a bit of it off on the corners. It's not much of a issue. Just as long as the screen protector is not too far off the phone's corners then it'll be fine. And it's easy to take it off. No pain.The case is not too hard not to soft. You use have ever used Incipio's cases, then you know how it feels and how these two products are quite similar to each other.It doesn't collect dirt and dust like some users have described. Like I said, it tightly clasps to the phone.On another note, I don't really like the branding on the back. I wish it was smaller or at least placed somewhere else.And another thing, the case doesn't cover the camera and flash. That really exposes it to scratches. You can use a screen protector and cut a small piece of it and cover that area. Make sure to NOT use the anti-glare ones. It'll make pictures really blurry.

This case feels sturdier. It has a very snug fit. I have a clear protector on the back of my phone and it does not give a "wet look" when used with this case. All the buttons are protected and easy to press. The grip it adds is perfect for both hands and pockets. All the holes are cutout perfectly and are wide enough not to interfere with the plugging in of wide-tipped accessories. The pink glittery look is very nice and does not easily show discoloration, like from dirt or makeup. I only gave this a four because I believe only cases like Ballistic & Otterbox are 5-star protective cases. This is my 2nd pick since I cant get one of those, yet. Just note, choose a screen protector that does fit from edge to edge. It needs to stop a little from the edge because the Nexus screen curves at the edges and a case like this will push the edges up & make them bubble and whatnot. Its pretty ugly and annoying to have to keep smoothing them back down. For reference,  Im using the ArmorSuit front and back protectors which are my favorite, but not with this case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A55Q2HA" id="B00A55Q2HA-review47" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-04:</strong> Diztronic matte flexible tpu case for lg nexus 4.

There was no cover with porthole cut-out for the lens, to help me index my fingers and to keep my palm off the lens.So I picked this back-covering case up for less than $10 and I am very pleased with it - it is hardshell polycarbonate so it is ultra light and ultra thin. It has a matte finish which makes it a little grippier. The front edge is slightly raised off the glass so you can set this glass-down on a nightstand without worry. All controls are easy to operate and earphones fit in fine. The one caveat is that the top and bottom edges are left mostly uncovered (this is a "tray style" design that clamps on the left and right edges and leaves the top and bottom mostly exposed). I thought there was no logo on the back, but at the bottom there is one subtly embossed. Very understated.If you want slightly better edge protection you will want to get the stock Google case (which is bumper style, wrapping around all four edges) or the TPU version of this case, theDiztronic Matte Back Black Flexible TPU Case for LG Nexus 4 - Retail Packaging. The TPU edition is made of softer, thicker material and covers all edges. It also covers the on-off switch and volume controls, which is both a blessing and a curse - fewer "accidental ons" but more pressure required when you actually intend to operate a switch or rocker. For other devices I have owned both styles, hardshell polycarbonate and TPU, and my preferences shift from time to time and mood to mood - the hardshells always look thinner and better, but the TPU entices with promises of better protection.The reviewer who noted that the bottom edge is a little sharp on his pinky (due to being cut away to a small piece), and after reading his review I confirm that he is right, but I grip the phone slightly differently and for my primary use (landscape mode for internet and texts) it is a non-issue. He and another reviewer (at least one other reviewer) also noticed that there is extra cutout space on the top of the speaker slot, but the bottom butts up to, or slightly covers, the bottom-most portion of the speaker slot. I probably wouldn't have noticed but for their reviews, and while this is aesthetically slightly imprecise, it has no effect on the speaker, which has plenty of uncovered slot to blast through. I have more of an issue with rear-firing speakers on phones (and tablets) that easily double in volume if I cup my hand behind them to redirect the sound forward.Other than that, I'll avoid my usual loquaciousness - this is an elegant, minimalist case that does it's job and actually dresses up the phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A55Q2HA" id="B00A55Q2HA-review51" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-27:</strong> I liked this cover very much even though it could be made slightly better.Pro's1.

I was skeptic of buttons' design on this case, but they are actually very fluid while pressing and require no extra effort to press it. I liked to cut out design on Galaxy Nexus Rev 3, so I was not sure about this Nexus 4  case design. Actually buttons are design with spring action, so its every easy to press, but pop back like TV Remote with no effort. However, buttons are easy to press, I feel they are small, they need to be a tiny bit bigger, not much, just a little bit. In addition, case fits very tightly, and have to make an effort to pull it out. WHICH I THINK IS GOOD, I prefer all cases made like that. I would highly recommend it. GO FOR IT.

I can't give it 5 stars yet because I want to see how it lasts.  That aside, this case is somewhat unique.  I've used smart phone covers for years and they tend to be either very flexible (even flimsy) when they are made out of silicon or way too hard (plastic-y) and offer little to no protection.DIZTRONIC seems to find the perfect sweet spot.  I don't know if it will get loose over time that is my only worry and at $12-13 bucks I was leery but if it holds up and doesn't lose it's shape and tightness than this product will EASILY be 5 stars, but right now I'll say 4 just to see how it holds up.  That said, honestly the other cases for the Nexus 4 look kinda crappy and cheap so I would pay the extra couple bucks on go with this one.I do regret a bit getting the smoke color, it makes the case look a little cheaper than it is.  It's an aesthetic thing and it was totally my decision, but if I had to do it again I would go with solid black.  One last thing, the FEEL of the case is PERFECT! It doesn't fingerprint or (so far) get greasy from natural hand oils like the more flimsy silicon cases do....an update after some time.

This comes in two somewhat separate parts, the handlebar assembly and a removable case assembly.  If you take the "case" off the handlebar assembly, you have to snap it back into place perfectly or it will fall off quite easily at the first bump in the road.That being said, if you make sure the assembly is secure, it really is secure.  It normally takes me a few times of removing and putting it back before it won't fall off.  I check this before I ride every time, even though I never take the case off.  It seems like if I bump it just right in my garage, it gets loose again.  I'm glad my phone has an insurance policy.I can operate my phone somewhat through the plastic, but it is hard to do when you're riding.  I mostly wanted it to display my runkeeper stats while cycling, so that's not a problem for me.  The ball joint is adjustable so I haven't had a major problem with glare (a little is to be expected).Overall a good case.  I wish the case assembly and handlebar assembly were a single piece, but I guess I can see where others would want to remove the whole case when parking their bikes (personally, I just take the phone out).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0047ELBOE" id="B0047ELBOE-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-23:</strong> I got it for My I phone But its not really what I was expected the value of this is great what I mean its worth your money but I had to use it for my Navigation instead of my iPhone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0047ELBOE" id="B0047ELBOE-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-13:</strong> that is all i need , pretty cool , waterproof and with good lock system and most important part is u can use ur smartphone while its inside it witch for me its pretty coolbefore receiving it i was kind of worry about quality of product but now i totally recommend this product :)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0047ELBOE" id="B0047ELBOE-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-01:</strong> Without the case, I can just attach my Garmin directly to the handlebar mount. This is primarily how I plan to use this device BUT if I get caught in the rain, at least I have the option of throwing my GPS inside this waterproof case. The case seems pretty bulky to me. This might be a benefit if you have a large GPS or phone that you're trying to fit inside of it; kind of overkill for my Garmin and iPhone 4S.Plenty of glare as well... if you're using it in the rain though, that might not be a major concern.All in all, it ain't pretty but it'll get the job done.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0047ELBOE" id="B0047ELBOE-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-13:</strong> This Phone pouch would also work for may other phone or gadgets.

The case zipper shuts with a flap that covers the zipped part. It has a cross  access slit for cables or headphone cable.

I did stretch a corner out a bit and the holes are a little off...but honestly for $5, you get a pretty dang decent case. Won't protect from a big fall like an Otter Box, but it will protect from scratches and minor bumps. Plus I got 6 rather than 5 screen protectors...came in handy considering I had to go through about 3 to get it on without bubble.

Putting this case on, you'll find that it fits perfectly around the phone. It fits easily, without actually falling out when you don't want it to. There is also a lifting edge around the screen, so that it doesn't contact the surface you set it on (I think this is pretty standard now).The one gripe I have is that the microphone, next to the usb charging port, is partially covered by the case. This is nothing a razor can't fix, but it's disappointing that it wasn't engineered perfectly!The reason I switched to this case from the D30 was because of the buttons, they were covered by the D30 and not easy to press. Cutouts are a huge plus and make the phone feel a lot easier and funner to use. However, when compared to the D30, the Diztronic feels a bit flimsy and lacking in the protection area.All in all, I like the case, especially for the price! But I may try keep looking as new cases come out (Incipio looks promising).**** EDIT 1/6/2012Changing to 5-star because they listened and made the hole on the bottom of the phone bigger to make room for the microphone. Also, I ended up switching to the D30 for a while, but couldn't stand the largeness of it, or the annoyance of having to press the buttons so hard. I'm sticking with this case for a while.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005YEFM8M" id="B005YEFM8M-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-26:</strong> I've been using Diztronic for TPU cases for about a year now and I must say they are great!

I value thinness and comfort in my pocket over the protection since I'm pretty good with with phone. Don't toss it too much, just on soft surfaces like my bed.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005YEFM8M" id="B005YEFM8M-review39" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-01:</strong> For the unaware, TPU is a material that is essentially a blend between plastic hard cases and soft silicone cases.  It's flexible like silicone, but it's smooth like plastic.  The fit is great, it has perfectly cut openings for both the top and bottom mic holes and all the buttons are easily accessible.  I'm guessing that the reviews that say that the case covers the mic or has incorrect cuts is for the first revision, but with this current revision (revision 2) I can confirm that all the holes are cut perfectly.As for the utility of the case, it depends on what you're looking for.  It will serve perfectly fine in preventing your phone from getting scratched or dinged, but since it's less "gel" like than silicone and leans more towards plastic in that respect, it's impact resistance I would imagine is pretty low.  If you drop your phone on concrete, expect a lot of shock to course through your phone (which might not actually damage it, but certainly has the potential to) but your phone will emerge scratch free from the drop.  The benefit of having a slicker/harder surface than silicone is that it doesn't stretch (it is flexible enough to apply, but won't stretch permanently like silicone if you play with it too much) and it will slide in and out of your pocket with ease.  I always avoid silicone cases because they stretch and catch on the inside of my pocket.Overall a great fitting case and if it fits your needs (read: if you don't drop your phone from large heights often) it will do the job.  Only slight issue I have with the case is cosmetic, with this color (matte black) the front half is glossy while the back half is matte.  Presumably it looks that way to match the glossy glass of the front better, but I'm personally not a huge fan of glossy in general, and certainly not such an obtrusive color change halfway through the case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B005YEFM8M', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B005YEFM8M', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B009X9ZBRQ</h2>    <p class="price"> $B009X9ZBRQ</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

This unit was provided to me for review.  At first, I thought it was going to be a Samsung Galaxy version of the Bose iPod/iPhone docking station but this is a beast of its own.I really liked the fact that once you dock the Note 2, you have a cute little remote control to control everything.  I thought that was very clever. Even without the remote, I still liked how you could control the volume at the base.  The whole design of the station is very aesthetically pleasing. The installation manual that you get is straight forward but I had a little bit of difficulty getting it to work right away. I guess this is my fault for not being tech savvy. I even had to contact support to troubleshoot it but they were kind and courteous enough to help via email. The problem I had was to get the sound to play out of the dock speakers once it was in the dock.  My fault for not knowing this but you have to make sure your phone is set up properly first (On the Note 2, Settings => System => Accessory => checkmark box audio output mode). Anyways, after I got it set up I was able to get everything to work very quickly.I do have one small complaint about the design though.  The cradle that the phone sits in should be changed in some way.  The cradle they put on is probably for a S2 cradle so I had to remove the S2 cradle and replace it with the Note 2 cradle (which is provided).  However, the cradles seemed so flimsy that I was almost afraid to break it when I tried to take off the S2 cradle; and the way the Note 2 cradle snaps in is a little freaky to me but the phone fits like a glove in the cradle.  My personal suggestion to future models is to have a one size fits all cradle if it were possible or to have an exchangeable cradle that slides versus snaps in.  It feels like over time if you have to change cradles over time then it would snap or break.  I think this is perfect for the person or persons who have the same style phone so you don't have to keep exchanging cradles.The sound quality of the system was great.  I couldn't be happier.  I was expecting a whiny pitchy kind of noise since the station was so small (like other stations) but quite surprisingly it sounded very full.  I went ahead to stream some Netflix movies on there just for the heck of it and it was nice.  I even tested the AUX cable and the quality was equally as good as if it was docked. There wasn't any pitchy or crackling noises in the background when it was on higher volumes so that made me happy.  I didn't crank it ALL the way up just because I don't like the way any sound system sounds like that loud so I cannot comment on that. But overall, I was very happy with it.All in all if you are looking for a dock for your Galaxy, I think this is it.  It sounds great and it's not outrageously priced like other systems I've seen out there; and won't give you that cheap pitchy sound like those lower end ones.  A+ for me, just remember to get the settings right on the phone =)FOLLOW UP 12/14/12After a few days of testing and doing a side by side comparison to the Bose system, my wife notices that the sound generated from the gDock is more of a direct sound while the Bose has a more full surround sound effect. She felt that the room filled with more sound with the Bose. I just thought I'd share my wife's opinion because she has a better ear at music than I do. Still, I'm keeping my rating at 5 for the sound quality at the price point compared to other units; design and the functionality of the unit</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009X9ZBRQ" id="B009X9ZBRQ-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-19:</strong> Gdock is designed to be used as a docking station for use with Samsung Galaxy phones.  It can also be used a speakers for any device if the device is connected via AUX IN port by audio cable (included).  I received this unit from manufacture for testing purposes to write an unbiased and honest review.  I tested this speaker with Android Phone, our two Android tablets (Nexus and Galaxy) as well as a computer speaker. You will find both positives and negatives I encountered during my testing.Gdock works with AC power source or alternatively can work through a lithium-ion rechargeable battery (sold separately).  However, it recharges the phone only when plugged into the AC source.  When it operates on the battery it only behaves as the speakers.I am attaching a collage of seven photos numbered 1 though 7 under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review.Photo #1 shows everything that comes in the box: Gdock, cradles, remove control, power cable, audio cable, power supply and cable.Gdock comes with 6 holders for Galaxy SIII, Galaxy Note, Galaxy SII SGH-T989, Galaxy SII GT-I9100 SGH-1777, Galaxy SOO  SPH-D719. The GDock comes pre-installed with a cradel fro S III cradle. The cradle can be removed by sliding it up, and replaced with another cradle if needed.  Photo #1 shows me sliding one of the cradles into the dock.Photo #2 shows the back of the unit, where in the center you see audio in and power connections. On the sides of the unit you see two bass ports for extending the bass performance.One of the things I found in testing is that the sound is significantly improved if you position the unit in a way that the sound coming out of these port holes has a solid surface to reflect from.  The difference was significant and significantly improved my opinion of the sound quality.Photo #3 shows Gdock on the digital scale. It weights in at 3.3 pounds and feels significant and well built.Gdock comes with a remote control, which has the following operations:1. On/off2. Mute on/off3. Volume up and down4. Reset to factory settings5. Bass up and down6. Change audio from Aux In to Samsung Galaxy7. Treble up and downWhen the unit is turned on a blue LED light on the front of the speaker is turned on.  This light is a bit subtle, it shines through the speaker cloth and I did not notice it right away. I put a red square around this light in picture #7 to bring it to your attention.PHONE TESTING (USB port):------------------------------To position the phone in the doc the phone is slid into the cradle from the top, through the arms of the cradle and inserted into the micro USB jack connector at the bottom of the cradle. The phone can be positioned either vertically or horizontally on the doc by rotating the docking port.Photo #4 shows the Nexus Galaxy phone I used for testing. Several important notes on the phone. The Nexus Galaxy phone is not officially listed as a supported phone. In addition the phone is normally used with an extra large battery which makes it significantly fatter than a standard battery.  Despite the "unofficial" configuration I thought this test would be of interest to people who own this phone model.1) Two of the cradles fit the Nexus Galaxy phone with the standard battery: Galaxy SIII and Galaxy SI SGH-T989.2) When the phone had its extra large battery installed none of the cradles fit, but the unit could be inserted into the USB connection without the cradle. It made a good connection as indicated by the Battery App (see below). Photo #5 shows the side view of phone with the extra large battery on Gdock.Photo #6 show the phone charging. I used Battery App by Elvison to determine the device recognized the charging source. 'AC' status means the charging is at full charging rate. 'USB' status indicates charging at a lower charging rate. 'Discharging' status means that the charging rate is below the power that the device is consuming so it slows down the discharge rate but does not re-charge. The battery app showed that the phone is connected and is charging at USB rate. This is not surprising, since the USB connector has to be a data connector to carry music data to the speaker.Difference between a charging cable and a data cable:Charging cables short the two data connections together (rendering them useless for data transfer), but this fools devices to see them as an AC power connection, and thus accept the higher current of the charging source.SPEED OF CHARGING:Gdock USB source ... 1% charge in 10 minutes(by comparison AC source charges this phone 6% in 10 minutes)Photo #7 shows the phone playing music.  However, Nexus Phone appears to be incompatible with the speaker.  The speakers did not engage, even though the battery app showed that the phone was connected and recognized by Gdock.  Since this phone was not officially listed as a supported phone I am not deducting any stars from the rating, but this finding was a surprise to me and I wanted to share it with other Nexus Galaxy phone owners.OTHER DEVICES (AUDIO IN port)------------------------------The rest of my experiments was using the audio jack on the back of the unit.  I tested Gdock with Nexus 7 Tablet, Galaxy 7.7 Tablet, and as desktop computer speaker. As I mentioned earlier the key to getting good sound from this speaker is to put right agaist a wall or in our case a window pane. This really improved the bass performance.  The front facing stereo speakers generate crisp and clear sound, the mid-range was very good.  With speaker against the surface the bass sound was reasonable.When I was testing this speaker as a computer speaker I  compared it (using the same piece of music and two different computers) to Cambridge Soundworks speakers and Labtec speakers.These speakers did not perform as well as my Cambridge Soundsworks but better than Labtec speakers.To summarize:------------------------------1. The mid-range of the speaker was very good, bass performance somewhat weaker but reasonable.2. Charging is at USB rate3. Speaker does not work with Galaxy Nexus phone, the charger does work.Ali Julia review</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009X9ZBRQ" id="B009X9ZBRQ-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-17:</strong> I set up this Grace Digital GDock in my office at work a few days ago, and have been enjoying listing to internet radio via Pandora and iHeartRadio apps ever since. Using my company cell phone (a Galaxy S3) and this speaker, we are able to listen to music throughout the whole office and into the back warehouse as well. The GDock comes with 5 different cradle adapters, for the Galaxy S1, S2, S3 and the Note 1 and 2. I use the adapter for the S3 with the GDock, which came with it already pre-installed. The S3 slides right into it, and plugs in at the base. Each of the docks can also be rotated sideways, which in turn sets your device screen on landscape view.The speaker has power buttons and volume buttons on both the GDock itself (at the top) and also on the wireless remote control that comes with it. The remote is small, not much larger than the palm of my hand. It would easily fit into a pants pocket. You can also adjust the treble and bass or mute the speaker, all from the remote. A battery is included, so you won't need to buy one for the remote control prior to using it.The included auxiliary cable plugs into the back of the speaker, allowing you to use all kinds of other (non-Galaxy) devices. We've used the auxiliary cable with several other players so people could listen to their play-lists. We've used MP3 players, iPods, Kindle Fires, etc. All have worked great!The speaker is weighty and feels solid. Not cheap and flimsy at all. It comes with a wall power adapter, and there is also an optional rechargeable battery made for this speaker (sold separately). When your device is plugged into the speakers dock, it will play your music and also charge your Galaxy at the same time, assuming you're using the wall adapter to power it. After reading through the included information, I did see that if you're using the optional rechargeable battery with this GDock and it's not plugged in to the wall adapter as well, it will just play music and not charge your device at the same time. This way, the power in the rechargeable battery is saved for running the speaker for as long as possible.This GDock has been great to have in the office, and everyone loves it. It works well, sounds great and will play music as loudly or as softly as we want it. Even right now I'm downloading a playlist of Christmas music to my phone, so we can have it playing in the office for the holidays on the GDock. I was provided a sample unit from the manufacturer for an unbiased review of its performance. Grace Digital makes a wide variety of nice speaker docks, including one for the Kindle Fire called theMatchStick. I have that one as well and use it all the time at home, having it set up in my kitchen. Because of their versatility and quality, they are some of my favorite speakers and would definitely recommend them to anyone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009X9ZBRQ" id="B009X9ZBRQ-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-15:</strong> I'm familiar with the Grace Digital dock for the original Kindle Fire. But, while it had a number of great features, it didn't work well for me since the on/off button would not properly engage with the Kindle. So I was very interested to try out their new dock for the Samsung Galaxy/Note.Very pleased! Everything feels substantial, especially the phone cradles. It comes with a total of 5 cradles to fit the Galaxy S2, S3 and Note. I'm using the dock mainly with my S2, but also borrowed a Note to try that out (worked well). The cradles hold the phone securely, and rotate for either landscape or portrait viewing. I found it very easy to swap out cradles (no tools are needed).The dock itself can be flipped so it either rests on its side or on its back. It has non-slip pads on the both the base and the back of the dock to help keep it from sliding. I found you can also stand it on its end without any problems. It's not designed for this, so it's not the most stable position, but it's workable for me (I keep it on a small shelf above my desk, so space is at a premium).The power cord plugs into the back of the dock. I very much like that it does not have a wall wart at the end of the plug, but rather has an inline transformer. The cord that plugs into the dock is permanently attached to the transformer; the cord that plugs into the wall has a conventional 2-prong plug. You still have to deal with a transformer (it's a rectangular box about 2 inches by 4 inches, and about 1 inch thick) but it's not at the end of the plug where it would block other outlets.It comes with a slim remote that controls volume, power, bass and treble. You can also use it to switch to the aux input (more on that later). The remote does not control or interface with the phone - it only controls the features on the dock. It includes the flat battery (CR2025 size) which is a nice touch.The sound quality is quite good. Not audiophile good, but better than other docks I've tried in this price range. I very much like that the bass and treble are adjustable. In fact, be sure to play with them right when you first use the dock - the EQ settings on mine were really out of whack when I first set it up, with no bass output at all. Once adjusted, however, the bass output was much better.It has two 3 inch full-range speakers. Although the speakers are powered with an impressive 16 watts, a full-range speaker is just not going to provide room-filling thumping bass nor ultra-clear highs. If you want that you'll need to look elsewhere (and dig a lot deeper in your wallet to pay for it).  But given the g dock's price point I'm more than pleased with the sound quality.It has an aux input so you can plug in anything that has a standard 1/4 inch plug. I've tried it using a Sandisk MP3 player and a Kindle Fire. Works well and extends the usefulness of the dock beyond just a Samsung phone dock. It includes a male/male cord that is of pretty decent quality.It has the ability to run off of a battery pack that is sold separately. That was not included with my review unit so I can't provide any details about it. I see that Amazon has one for the Kindle Fire dock (Grace Digital Matchstick for Kindle Fire Rechargeable Battery Pack) but I don't know if that is the right one for this dock. I imagine it is, but will check with the manufacturer and report back. Having the battery pack is a great feature for portability. Note, however, that the battery pack only powers the dock and will not power or recharge the phone. The dock has to be plugged in for the latter.[UPDATE: The manufacturer got back to me very quickly, and confirmed that the Matchstick battery will work with the gdock]The main misses are with the controls. Or rather, the control indicator lights. The trend in many electronics these days is to have piercing indicator lights that appear much like miniature lighthouse beacons in a dark room. I really hate that! But, ironically, I'm not found of the g-dock's approach of having very muted indicator lights. They are covered by the speaker cloth which makes them even more difficult to see. This is not a major flaw since you can see them if you're close to the dock. Plus the remote covers all the bases if you're farther away from the dock. But I'd still like a more visible power indicator to remind me to turn it off. I also wish it had larger control buttons, and had better quality speaker cloth (or, better yet, metal mesh).But those minor issues aside, I think this is a great dock. Solid performance and nice design touches. Highly recommend.[The manufacturer provided me with this product for review]</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009X9ZBRQ" id="B009X9ZBRQ-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-29:</strong> I got this unit a few days ago. Note that the unit comes with a Samsung Galaxy S3 adapter installed. I have an S2. It was quite easy to snap off the installed adapter and install the included S2 adapter. I also purchased the battery attachment. That was also easy to install.First impressions: It looks good on my desk. The phone connects easily & powers up / charges ok. Note: It is not easy to quickly pop the phone out of the dock when a call is incoming. A better approach is to leave the phone attached overnight for charging & then pop it out for daytime phone usage. I'm still working out the best pattern of use. Pop-out directions: Place your fingers of both hands on the top of the dock. Then gently place your thumbs on the lower edges of the phone & gently lever the phone up & out of the dock. This will ensure a longer lasting connection (that being the thing most likely to break on the phone (unless you drop the puppy, of course).I haven't tried the music operation, the remote control, or other features yet. ... I'll add to this review in a week, or so, when I have more time to play with it. Right now, I'm quite happy with the unit. ....Warning: Verify that you have a compatible device before purchasing. It comes with a bunch of adapters, please ensure that your phone is one that this device has an adapter for in it's collection.-----Important Note: After using this dock, I have noticed one thing that you will need to be aware of about it. When the phone reaches a 100% charge, it turns the screen on. This may be a function of the phone, but it is a bit annoying to place the tablet into the dock in the evening, turn the screen off (sleep mode) & then later see that the screen has turned on.-----One other thing: I have been using the unit for a few weeks now & it has a very important (unintended) feature! Here's the scoop: I have seen many folks break/snap-off the USB connector on their cell phones when they connect the USB connector to recharge the phone. This is caused by the slight twisting of the plug as it is inserted. The Grace Digital unit's slide eliminates this. You simply place the phone on the holder & gently push down on the phone & PRESTO! the phone is connected. Removing it is even easier. Just place your hands on the unit, your thumbs on the bottom of the phone & gently squeeze. Out pops the phone. No torque. No stress. No damage.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009X9ZBRQ" id="B009X9ZBRQ-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-18:</strong> Some people might think that the gdock is simply another gizmo that really isn't need, but far from it.  If you tried or purchased Grace Digital'sCharging Speaker Dock for the Kindle Fire, and you have a Galaxy S2, S2 or Note, you'll definitely be interested in this dock as well.  You can simultaneously charge your Samsug and stream your choice of audio.One of the nicest features is the Aux-in.  If you want you can plug in any audio source sources.  For example, if you have something special on your iPad you can connect.  The speakers have surprisingly good sound and the bass and treble can be tweaked with the small, wafer-thin remote.  Mind you, the sound is not high-end, but is high quality and enjoyable.There are several dock adapters, each of which can be rotated in a vertical (portrait) or horizontal (landscape) manner.  You can also can control your view angle to either 38 or 50 degrees.  I do like the fact that the gdock is not only a versatile device, but also a sleek and attractive one.If you subscribe to "Stereophile" you need not apply here, but if you want a really nice dock that charges your phone and plays audio from your Samsung at home or in your office you'll love it.  The warranty is for one year and, as most companies, comes with the expectation that you'll take reasonably good care of the unit.  Grace Digital, in my experience, is one of the more highly responsive companies to work with.

It was simple to put together.  My Samsung Galaxy sIII fits perfectly into the holder (there are 3 other holders to fit other Samsung products; Galaxy sII, Galaxy Note I and II, etc...  In another review, the writer states that your phone does not fit in the holder if it has "clothes" on--meaning a phone case/cover.  However, I own two, thin, Galaxy sIII "skins" in different colors with a flap that goes over the face of the phone for added protection.  I did not have to take the cover off to dock my Galaxy sIII.  It fit perfectly and docks very easily both inserting and removing--no forceful pushing or pulling.The sound is surprisingly good.  My living room is central to the rest of my house, and I could hear the music from every other room I was in--including the basement.  Nice bass and treble balance with a remote control, that is no bigger than a credit card, that allows you to adjust bass and treble levels as well as volume.The product itself is very nice looking.  Sleek design, and with my phone docked into it with the flap over the face of the phone, you can hardly tell there is another device attached to the speaker system.I highly recommend this product as a mid-range price performance purchase.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009X9ZBRQ" id="B009X9ZBRQ-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-16:</strong> Finally "Galaxy S" or "Galaxy Note" owners have their counterpart to any of the "iHome" or "iPhone" docking systems.  This is a beauty.  Perfectly sized for the desktop, it is simple and clean.  Your Phone or Note fits the proprietary male plug (Micro USB Jack Connector) easily and there are four different cradles to attach to your gdock depending on what device you have.The stereo speakers (3" each) have an arguably better sound (both treble, midrange and bass) than the iHome desktops and I own two.  It matches the sound of theGrace Digital MatchStick (GDI-GFD7200) Charging Speaker Dock for Kindle Fire - Portrait and Landscape Modesin that department.  There is a wafer thin remote that only adjusts the volume, bass, treble and EQ (resets to factory equalizer setting) as well as the power.  The back of the gdock has two Bass Ports and that is what gives it such a strong firm bass.  You'll want these exposed in the back and not on the bottom of the unit.The gdock is attractively sleek with a black fabric finish.  The docks rotate and lock from 38 degrees to 50 degrees depending on how you want your device to look.  You can even choose two positions to set your entire gdock - although it's only a matter of an inch or two differences.  The power light is a tiny blue LED and is hard to see unless it is very dark.The power connector is one of those double cables with a black box the size of a cigarette case, but that's fairly minor.  You can charge your device and battery when the gdock is plugged into a wall source, but it won't charge your device (phone) from just the gdock battery.  The back has a battery door for the OPTIONAL lithium battery which is sold separately.  I did not get one, but it is supposed to last up to six hours.If you want to plug another device into your gdock, there is the standard 3.5mm insert in the back.  An Aux-In cable is supplied for this.The price is comparable to any other docking units on the market, but I think the selling point for the gdock is the multiple cradles included and the absolutely great sound.  Mind you, it's not really loud, but plenty for any room.  By the way, if you want an alarm clock, just use your Galaxy phone.Grace Digital Inc. was kind enough to supply a unit for review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009X9ZBRQ" id="B009X9ZBRQ-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-27:</strong> PROS:average sizegood soundminimal light output3 docking optionsincludes remote and aux-in cordCONS:no clockno AM/FM radio optionwill not fit phone (Note II) with slimline TPU caselarge AC adapter box on the cord...not ideal for small spacesremote is tinyno headphone jackI really liked this dock.

I have the blue rear cover that matches my blue phone perfect. This product review took a few unexpected turns as I will point out.First item, after MANY years of buying Anker products because I've loved their quality, I was offered to test and review this battery for free. This will not influence my positives and criticisms of the product!Shipping of the product was very quick. The turn around time from confirmation of shipping to actually receiving the product was 3 days. Very pleasing considering that my stock battery lasted just over half a day. I was eager to get this battery.Packaging and unboxing is above what I've seen from other products. The kit comes in a nice package, not some cheap cardboard box with stuff rattling inside. This is a nice clear plastic package with the warranty info, instructions, the battery and rear cover. Packaging you would expect of a higher quality retail product.The battery is obviously bigger but not anything unexpected from a double capacity battery.  The rear cover material felt sturdy but I was nervous of its durability. That was put to rest a couple of times and finally today absolute.The battery fits perfect in the phone, secure. The rear cover snaps on nice and tight with no creaking or looseness. A couple of very smart additions to the rear cover have been added. A port extending to the speaker inside the back makes sound as good as stock. Bass actually seems a little improved but that's negligible. A small bump on the outside of the rear cover located at the speaker may help lift the phone slight enough so when laid flat the speaker is not completely covered. Two small but great additions that show some proper engineering was involved.The slightly increased thickness of the phone actually greatly increases comfort and I personally prefer the shape to stock since it fits the hand naturally.Performance. I received the battery at 57% charge. I did a nasty thing and ran it from 57% charge to empty without charging it first out of the box and it lasted longer then the stock battery when fully charged. (Follow the proper instructions and charge properly) So then I did the full charge. I was blown away. I expected double the life but I've been getting easily better then double. So I decided to turn all the features on. Still over double the stock battery. A very interesting outcome indeed.So I performed another charge and now I've overclocked the phone to 2.2 Ghz from 1.9 Ghz, plus some other go fast CPU tricks. A real battery killer setup I will admit.Results are two full days of use and counting on one charge. Again overclocked and heavy use. How is 35+ hours and 11+ hrs screen on and I still have 25%. Message me for screen shots if desired.Oh and the rear cover durability. I've dropped my phone 4 times this week alone, twice on concrete. Four foot+ drops and the rear cover just today has developed a small crack. To be fair, the phone bezel had gotten chipped and the edge of the screen is now damaged but the Anker rear cover just snapped right back into place and still fits like brand new.

The stock battery just never has enough juice to get me through the day, no matter what! And why should I have to turn off all the fun features of the phone just to save battery? I ordered this and it is perfect. The color matches my white S4 perfectly and the case is a slick plastic. Very nice in my opinion. I ordered a Hyperion extended battery case and it fit this extended battery perfectly. A case is a necessity to me and it doesn't make the phone any bulkier. Battery gets me through the day with HEAVY usage with about 50% at the end of the day. If I didn't have access to a charger I could easily make this last two whole days with heavy usage!

Im a heavy user with my phone, and even though I would carry an external charger with me; with this battery in and charged up at the start of my day, I no longer have to. It pretty much lasts the entire day. And the cover is very durable. It is smooth hard plastic, but it isnt so slippery that I feel like its going to slip out of my hands. I dropped it yesterday and discovered its surprisingly durable......not a scratch after hitting the floor, though the cover popped off on impact. And no scratches on my phone either!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CN4T87C" id="B00CN4T87C-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-25:</strong> I would say that this is a good extension to the phone to run on one battery. practical? thats for you to decide. I hated that it was so bulky at least for the pocket. It did make it easier to hold but I soon just adopted an easy simple process. I bought 2 other batteries slightly higher mah over stock and it came with a battery charger and bam! You have twice the battery life in seconds of changing the batteries. This keeps the phone sleek and "pocketable".

The back seems fragile and thin much like OEM's but holds up and the phone belongs in a case. I came from a Droid Pro with extended battery which increased the depth by about 10%, but this battery increases the depth by 2x and the weight by about the same.  I do like the extended time, was just unprepared for the increase in depth and weight. But again, I do like the extended phone time.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CN4T87C" id="B00CN4T87C-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-16:</strong> It delivers what it promises, last twice long the stock battery and when I come to my house later in the night the phone still have 50% left of battery.

I use third-party folio-type cases on my phone most of the time, which provides a bit of protection when the phone is dropped. (Alas, that happens.) I was hoping that this battery could be fitted into the folio case if I left the original back off the phone. No such luck! The battery works well, but for me, the inability to fit it all into a case is a liability. I don't expect to use it much. We have a regular-sized battery from Anker also, and it is working just fine.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CN4T87C" id="B00CN4T87C-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-18:</strong> I'm a veteran of extended batteries and if you go cheap you get what you pay for.  This one from Anker I thought I could say was the exception as they are a direct competitor of EZOPower in the alternative power market for cell phones and they make a good product.  I'm obviously in error mainly because of the advertised mAh value of 5200.If you are familiar with your stock battery and its performance the first few weeks you'll know that if you download any battery widgets you are rated for roughly 22-23 hours of use by any measure.  Actually using the phone degrades this a great deal however, I've tried several widgets and the phone battery gauge.  Nothing points to this giving ANY additional power from the OEM 2600mAh battery during the first week of operation.I did notice after it was rated at 100% charged that the phone notated it not being "fully charged" for another hour and ten minutes, which I've never seen with any other battery however the discharge cycle is the exact same length as an OEM 2600mAh battery.  That basically makes it an oversize OEM replacement with no discernible benefits other than adding the ability to use it as a bludgeon and I've got much cheaper rocks outside than a $600 phone.Overall it is an utter disappointment and no stretch of the imagination is going to stretch this battery's capacity.  I have let it charge for 11 hours and still, even rated fully charged by any of the calculation apps, it is just...the same as the factory battery on a good day.  The Seidio is rated for less but likely is at least what it claims to be.  I'll consider it next after returning this.  I give it 1 star.UPDATE:After interacting with Anker Customer Service and getting another battery to try I can say the performance is much better.  I've used it a few days now, going on a week, and while the "Not Fully Charged" phenomenon still persists, the rate of idle discharge is far lower and it easily survives a shift and a half of use in low reception areas (which drains a phone far faster than if you have full signal strength or WiFi to use) and it still charges about as fast as the stock battery (which I do not have a reason for but can certainly appreciate).  Certainly a turn around for the battery and I have nothing but good things to say about the Customer Service Representatives who assisted me.  I can safely recommend this product to friends at this point.  I'll give it 4 stars because it is really nice but I got a bad one to start so take that as it comes.  Sometimes batteries are inconsistent.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CN4T87C" id="B00CN4T87C-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-17:</strong> I have tried two different extended batteries with the replacement back that recess the flash.

Just food for though.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00H9Y5PYG" id="B00H9Y5PYG-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-14:</strong> This case was purchased for my wife and she is happy with it.

When I discovered this case I had to have one and am thrilled with it because it does everything I want.Foremost, it protects the screen because the case's bumper is slightly raised and there is a protective screen that provides another layer of protection. This is a two piece case plus a plastic holster that clips to a belt. The holster provides yet another layer of protection because the phone clips screen side into the casing of that component.The next layer of protection comes from the hard plastic inner case that has a soft, cushioning layer of material where your phone's battery cover contacts the surface of this case, and an outer cushion of neoprene-like material that will absorb some shock.All of the phone's functions are easily accessible, and the total area of the screen can be used, Even the S-Pen can be accessed, so this will not hamper normal phone operation.The protective screen is not as crystal clear as I would like, but I'll easily trade that for the protection that it provides. Believe me, if you ever crack a screen on a phone you will be willing to accept some compromises when it comes to protecting the screen on your next phone.While this is not waterproof, it will keep some moisture out as well as dust. The major feature, though, is protection in more hostile environments and this case provides that exceptionally well. It certainly gives me peace of mind.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00H9Y5PYG" id="B00H9Y5PYG-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-12:</strong> love the protection this item offers, item as described, packaged well and excellent shipping time, would give 5 stars but it does collect a lil more dust than it should under the built I screen proctor im having to take the case off and wipe it off and my phone couple days a week and the kickstand is an awesome feature but not to sturdy and when not in use it doesn't push down all the way, but overall I can recommend this item spite its lil flaws.thank you</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00H9Y5PYG" id="B00H9Y5PYG-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-29:</strong> This is a beast of a case, I wish i could upload a pic now!

The Holster makes it ease to access the phone, but takes a lil bit of focus to place it back in, but overall, very well crafted and durable. and definitely easy on the eyes.

I have try all possible way but it is hard to remove from the case I can't believe no one else said anything about this in there review  . Other than that the case is nice so I had no choice but to give it three star because of the s-pen problem I hope this review helps.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00H9Y5PYG', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00H9Y5PYG', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B0098FKH9M</h2>    <p class="price"> $B0098FKH9M</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

It fits well, is subtle, and the fit-and-finish on is great.  It also doesn't add much girth to the iPhone (i'm using it with an iPhone 5s).I love the way the rubber on the back feels.  It has a smooth satiney feel that also allows you to grip it well.The case does cover your volume up/down buttons, but they're easy to press.Just keep in mind: this isn't a waterproof case.  It's not an otter box or a lifeproof case.  If you're looking for something bulletproof, this isn't it.  If you're looking for a case with decent protection that looks good and is understated this does the job well</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0098FKH9M" id="B0098FKH9M-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-01:</strong> i've owned many iphones as well as many different cases relatively. in terms of iphone 5 cases, i've tried the clear ones, opaques, velvet soft cases, metal feeling cases, and bumpers, now i am looking for something different with more colors to it, many came up to the search but Incipio's color stood out the most, after reading many reviews and from my past experience with the brand, i chose this Gray/Orange one.first off, amazon surprised me with its speedy delivery, came in one day earlier than expected. i love the colors of the case, and it gives a great feeling when holding it, soft and velvety and yet not attract dirt, although it might appear to be a little bit bulgier than the slim cases from other brands, but i feel the protection to the phone.if you are looking for a colorful case with good hand feeling and quality, this is a very good choice.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0098FKH9M" id="B0098FKH9M-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-24:</strong> Great for the first few weeks, then it falls apart.

As many other users have said taking the case off is quite a challenge but it doesn't bother me.  Personally, I hated the feel of the Dual Pro.  Not sure why but holding my iPhone with that case gave me goose bumps.  I probably should have done my research before buying the OVRMLD but in a way I'm glad I went with it.  Since its slightly more flexible the texture feels more smoother than the hard polycarbonate feel of the Dual Pro. Protection is at its max while still keeping the phone slim.  It doesn't go scratch the screen so a screen protector shouldn't lift.  I have this case and the MobC Oleophobic with no lift problems.Overall, it's a great case with maximum protection but still maintain the slim factor of the IPhone 5.  Included you will find a case, screen protector, microfiber cloth and a handy phone stand.  Great buy if you can get it under $17.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0098FKH9M" id="B0098FKH9M-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-01:</strong> So to start with the good, this is a pretty sturdy case and fits very tightly and snugly around the iPhone. The case overall feels nice in the hand and getting the phone into it is pretty easy as it form fits the phone and just snaps in place. The bevels around the camera are nicely done.Now for the bad. It's very, very difficult to get the phone out of this case. The material is such that while it bends and conforms around the phone, it's too rigid when it comes to prising the phone out. It took some amount of bending and effort to get it off. It will eventually come off but I noticed that each time I removed the case, the stretching and bending it took to get it out started to damage the plastic, particularly around the the back near the raised logo piece. Also, not sure if it was related to the effort of getting the phone out, but the coating on the case started to peel around the bottom after only a two weeks of use. One final minor bit of criticism is that the ports on the bottom of the phone for speaker and microphone are not actually covered using this case. They are open slots. This isn't really a big deal and it does make sense to have them open to avoid blocking them, but i must say my current case covers them and has holes for sound and I much prefer this as it offers protection from dust etc.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0098FKH9M" id="B0098FKH9M-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-14:</strong> I received the case today but it does not look brand new, someone has returned it.

With that set up you could have an Elago S3 case on your phone AND it still fit in the aluminum stand! Great! I thought, when I bought an iPhone 4S. I got an Elago S4 slim case and then ordered one of these thinking I would get the same fit. Well, they didn't stick to their previous design. This stand will only work on a BARE iPhone 4S.
